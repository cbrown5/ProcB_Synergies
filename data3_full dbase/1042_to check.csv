The evidence reveals that the likelihood of regime shifts may increase when humans reduce resilience by such actions as removing response diversity, removing whole functional groups of species, or removing whole trophic levels; impacting on ecosystems via emissions of waste and pollutants and climate change; and altering the magnitude, frequency, and duration of disturbance regimes. The combined and often synergistic effects of those pressures can make ecosystems more vulnerable to changes that previously could be absorbed. As a consequence, ecosystems may suddenly shift from desired to less desired states in their capacity to generate ecosystem services. Active adaptive management and governance of resilience will be required to sustain desired ecosystem states and transform degraded ecosystems into fundamentally new and more desirable configurations.",925,2004,35,,557,581"Vitousek, PM; DAntonio, CM; Loope, LL; Rejmanek, M; Westbrooks, R",Introduced species: A significant component of human-caused global change,NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Review,"Biological invasions are a widespread and significant component of human-caused global environmental change. The extent of invasions of oceanic islands, and their consequences for native biological diversity, have long been recognized. However, invasions of continental regions also are substantial. For example, more than 2,000 species of alien plants are established in the continental United States. These invasions represent a human-caused breakdown of the regional distinctiveness of Earth's flora and fauna - a substantial global change in and of itself. Moreover, there are well-documented examples of invading species that degrade human health and wealth, alter the structure and functioning of otherwise undisturbed ecosystems, and/or threaten native biological diversity. Invasions also interact synergistically with other components of global change. notably land use change.

In this review, we synthesize data from 688 published studies to show that these drivers often alter competitive interactions among plants and animals, exert multitrophic effects on the decomposer food web, increase intensity of pathogen infection, weaken mutualisms involving plants, and enhance herbivory while having variable effects on predation. A recurrent finding is that there is substantial variability among studies in both the magnitude and direction of effects of any given GEC driver on any given type of biotic interaction. Further, we show that higher order effects among multiple drivers acting simultaneously create challenges in predicting future responses to global environmental change, and that extrapolating these complex impacts across entire networks of species interactions yields unanticipated effects on ecosystems. Finally, we conclude that in order to reliably predict the effects of GEC on community and ecosystem processes, the greatest single challenge will be to determine how biotic and abiotic context alters the direction and magnitude of GEC effects on biotic interactions.",545,2008,11,12,1351,1363"Brook, BW; Sodhi, NS; Bradshaw, CJA",Synergies among extinction drivers under global change,TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION,Review,"If habitat destruction or overexploitation of populations is severe, species loss can occur directly and abruptly.

Endophytes are considered plant mutualists: They receive nutrition and protection from the host plant while the host plant may benefit from enhanced competitive abilities and increased resistance to herbivores, pathogens, and various abiotic stresses. Limited evidence also indicates that endophytes may influence population dynamics, plant community diversity, and ecosystem function. However, most of the empirical evidence for this mutualism and its ecological consequences has been based on a few agronomic grass endophytes. More recent studies suggest that endophyte-host plant interactions are variable and range from antagonistic to mutualistic.

Near-exclusive focus on the secondary effect of these forms of harshness has led ecologists to believe that they reduce the importance of ecological interactions, such as competition, and favor coexistence of even ecologically very similar species. By examining both the costs and the benefits, we show that harshness alone does not lessen the importance of species interactions or limit their role in community structure. Species coexistence requires niche differences, and harshness does not in itself make coexistence more likely. Fluctuations in environmental conditions (e.g., disturbance, seasonal change, and weather variation) also have been regarded as decreasing species interactions and favoring coexistence, but we argue that coexistence can only be favored when fluctuations create spatial or temporal niche opportunities. We argue that important diversity-promoting roles for harsh and fluctuating conditions depend on deviations from the assumptions of additive effects and linear dependencies most commonly found in ecological models. Such considerations imply strong roles for species interactions in the diversity of a community.",389,1997,150,5,519,553"Paine, RT; Tegner, MJ; Johnson, EA",Compounded perturbations yield ecological surprises,ECOSYSTEMS,Article,"All species have evolved in the presence of disturbance, and thus are in a sense matched to the recurrence pattern of the perturbations. Consequently, disturbances within the typical range, even at the extreme of that range as defined by large, infrequent disturbances (LIDs), usually result in little long-term change to the system's fundamental character. We argue that more serious ecological consequences result from compounded perturbations within the normative recovery time of the community in question. We consider both physically based disturbance (for example, storm, volcanic eruption, and forest fire) and biologically based disturbance of populations, such as overharvesting, invasion, and disease, and their interactions. Dispersal capability and measures of generation time or age to first reproduction of the species of interest seem to be the important metrics for scaling the size and frequency of disturbances among different types of ecosystems. We develop six scenarios that describe communities that have been subjected to multiple perturbations, either simultaneously or at a rate faster than the rate of recovery, and appear to have entered new domains or ""ecological surprises."" In some cases, three or more disturbances seem to have been required to initiate the changed state. We argue that in a world of ever-more-pervasive anthropogenic impacts on natural communities coupled with the increasing certainty of global change, compounded perturbations and ecological surprises will become more common.

Simultaneously. humans are altering the capacity of reefs to cope with disturbance (e.g. by habitat fragmentation and reduction of functional diversity), which further exacerbates the effects of altered disturbance regimes.

The overall interaction effect across all studies was synergistic, but interaction type varied by response level (community: antagonistic, population: synergistic), trophic level (autotrophs: antagonistic, heterotrophs: synergistic), and specific stressor pair (seven pairs additive, three pairs each synergistic and antagonistic). Addition of a third stressor changed interaction effects significantly in two-thirds of all cases and doubled the number of synergistic interactions. Given that most studies were performed in laboratories where stressor effects can be carefully isolated, these three-stressor results suggest that synergies may be quite common in nature where more than two stressors almost always coexist.

In this paper we explore the potential synergetic effects between these factors. We argue that processes at two levels of spatial scale interact: the metapopulation level and the species range level. Current concepts of spatially dynamic metapopulations and species ranges are consistent, and integration improves Our understanding of the interaction of landscape level and geographical range level processes. In landscape zones in which the degree of habitat fragmentation allows persistence, the shifting of ranges is inhibited, but not blocked. In areas where the spatial cohesion of the habitat is below the critical level of metapopulation persistence, the expansion of ranges will be blocked. An increased frequency of large-scale disturbances caused by extreme weather events will cause increasing gaps and an overall contraction of the distribution range, particularly in areas with relatively low levels of spatial cohesion. Taking into account the effects of climate change on metapopulations, habitat distribution and land use changes, future biodiversity research and conservation strategies are facing the challenge to re-orient their focus and scope by integrating spatially and conceptually more dynamic aspects at the landscape level.

Defense against pathogens, by mounting an immune response, confers evident benefits but may also incur costs, so that the optimal level of defense is expected to depend on the balance between benefits and costs. Although the benefits of immune surveillance are well known, estimates of costs are still equivocal. Here we studied the behavioral and physiological modifications associated with exposure to a non-replicating antigen (lipopolysaccharide [LPS] of Escherichia coli) in a passerine species, the house sparrow (Passer domesticus). We further investigated whether the behavioral and physiological changes provoked by LPS induced measurable repercussions on life-history traits, such as the breeding effort and reproductive success. Finally, we tested whether the trade-off between immune activation and breeding effort was modulated by the workload required to feed the brood. Exposure to LPS reduced activity and increased body mass loss of captive individuals; similarly, LPS injection induced a dramatic drop in feeding rate and reproductive success of breeding females. However, this reduction depended on brood size, suggesting that the strength of the trade-off between immune activation and reproduction was affected by the workload required to feed the brood. Overall, this study stresses the magnitude of costs associated with mounting immune responses and the ecological and evolutionary consequences for natural populations.",252,2003,161,3,367,379"Portner, HO",Ecosystem effects of ocean acidification in times of ocean warming: a physiologist's view,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,Article,"Ocean warming and acidification occur at global scales and, in the case of temperature, have already caused shifts in marine ecosystem composition and function. In the case of CO2-induced ocean hypercapnia and acidification, however, effects may still be so small that evidence for changes in the field is largely lacking, Future scenarios indicate that marine life forms are threatened by the specific or synergistic effects of factors involved in these processes. The present paper builds on the view that development of a cause and effect understanding is required beyond empirical observations, for a more accurate projection of ecosystem effects and for quantitative scenarios. Identification of the mechanisms through which temperature- and CO2-related ocean physicochemistry affect organism fitness, survival and success, is crucial with this research strategy. I suggest operation of unifying physiological principles, not only of temperature but also CO2 effects, across animal groups and phyla. Thermal windows of optimized performance emerge as a basic character defining species fitness and survival, including their capacity to interact with other species. Through effects on performance at the level of reproduction, behaviour and growth, ocean acidification acts especially on lower marine invertebrates, which are characterized by a low capacity to compensate for disturbances in extracellular ion and acid-base status and sensitivity of metabolism to such disturbances. Available data suggest that one key consequence of these features is a narrowing of thermal tolerance windows, as well as a reduced scope for performance at ecosystem level.

We formalise a distinction between numerically mediated versus functionally moderated causal pathways. Despite superficial similarity of their effects, numerical and functional pathways stem from fundamentally different mechanisms of action and have fundamentally different consequences for conservation management.

We examine the possible relationship between these sudden declines and unusually warm, dry conditions in 1987 For our analyses of local weather patterns, we define a 12-month (July-June) amphibian moisture-temperature cycle consisting of four periods: (1) late wet season; (2) transition into dry season; (3) dry season; and (4) post-dry-season (early-wet-season) recovery. The 1986-1987 cycle was the only one on record (of 20 analyzed) with abnormally low rainfall in all four periods, and temperature anomalies in 1987 reached record highs. Flow in local aquifer-fed streams during the dry season and post-dry-season recovery period reached a record low. This climate disturbance, associated with the 1986-1987 El Nino/Southern Oscillation, was more severe than a similar event associated with the 1982-1983 El Nino, though this earlier oscillation was the strongest of the past century. Demographic data for one harlequin frog population, gathered during these two climatic events, support the hypothesis that in 1987, shortly before the population collapsed, the frogs underwent an unprecedented shift in distribution within the habitat in response to desiccating conditions. The juxtaposition of these rare demographic events suggests they were causally linked yet sheds little light on mechanisms underlying the sudden decline. While desiccation or direct temperature effects may have been factors leading to high adult mortality, moisture-temperature conditions may have interacted with some other, unidentified agent.

On the basis of the physiological and behavioural functions of the melanocortins, we predict five categories of traits correlated with melanin-based coloration. A review of the literature indeed reveals that, as predicted, darker wild vertebrates are more aggressive, sexually active and resistant to stress than lighter individuals.

These groups differ in growth form, phenology, and other traits relevant to nutrient cycling (e.g., rooting depth, litter C:N ratio). Two or three species of each type were planted in single-group treatments, and in two-, three-, and four-way combinations, giving a range of richness from zero to nine species. I tested the hypothesis that, because of complementary resource use, increasing functional group diversity will lead to higher net primary production. At the scale of this experiment (alpha-diversity and yearly production), more diverse treatments were not necessarily the most productive. Live plant biomass varied more within than among levels of diversity. In most two-, three-, and four-way mixtures of functional groups, overall productivity did not differ significantly from the average of the yields of component one-group treatments. This pattern apparently resulted from competition: early season annuals and late season annuals reduced the biomass of perennial bunchgrasses (the most productive group in monoculture) below levels expected from monoculture yields. Relative Yield Totals (RYT) indicated complementary resource use in the EL and LP two-way and ELPN four-way mixtures. In the EL mixture, complementarity appeared to result from temporal rather than spatial partitioning of resources. Because of shifts in root:shoot ratio in mixtures, however, only the LP treatment had consistently significant RYT >1 when assessing total (roots plus shoots) productivity and nitrogen yield. These results show that (1) composition (the identity of the species present) can be at least as important as richness (the number of species present) in effects on ecosystem processes; (2) competition during critical parts of the growing season may prevent absolute increases in net primary production with increasing diversity, despite complementary resource use at other times of the year; and (3) shifts in belowground allocation in species mixtures can have significant effects on estimates of productivity and resource use as species diversity changes.",224,1998,79,2,704,719"Vinebrooke, RD; Cottingham, KL; Norberg, J; Scheffer, M; Dodson, SI; Maberly, SC; Sommer, U",Impacts of multiple stressors on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning: the role of species co-tolerance,OIKOS,Article,"Ecosystem resistance to a single stressor relies on tolerant species that can compensate for sensitive competitors and maintain ecosystem processes, such as primary production. We hypothesize that resistance to additional stressors depends increasingly on species tolerances being positively correlated (i.e. positive species co-tolerance). Initial exposure to a stressor combined with positive species co-tolerance should reduce the impacts of other stressors, which we term stress-induced community tolerance. In contrast, negative species co-tolerance is expected to result in additional stressors having pronounced additive or synergistic impacts on biologically impoverished functional groups, which we term stress-induced community sensitivity.

To quantify the importance of land cover to describe and predict species distributions after using climate as the main driver. Location The study area is Europe. Methods (1) A multivariate analysis was applied to describe land-cover distribution across Europe and assess if the land cover is determined by climate at large spatial scales. (2) To evaluate the importance of land cover to predict species distributions, we implemented a spatially explicit iterative procedure to predict species distributions of plants (2603 species), mammals (186 species), breeding birds (440 species), amphibian and reptiles (143 species). First, we ran bioclimatic models using stepwise generalized additive models using bioclimatic variables. Secondly, we carried out a regression of land cover (LC) variables against residuals from the bioclimatic models to select the most relevant LC variables. Finally, we produced mixed models including climatic variables and those LC variables selected as decreasing the residual of bioclimatic models. Then we compared the explanatory and predictive power of the pure bioclimatic against the mixed model. Results (1) At the European coarse resolution, land cover is mainly driven by climate. Two bioclimatic axes representing a gradient of temperature and a gradient of precipitation explained most variation of land-cover distribution. (2) The inclusion of land cover improved significantly the explanatory power of bioclimatic models and the most relevant variables across groups were those not explained or poorly explained by climate. However, the predictive power of bioclimatic model was not improved by the inclusion of LC variables in the iterative model selection process. Main conclusion Climate is the major driver of both species and land-cover distributions over Europe. Yet, LC variables that are not explained or weakly associated with climate (inland water, sea or arable land) are interesting to describe particular mammal, bird and tree distributions.

We address this uncertainty by performing a meta-analysis of 112 published factorial experiments that evaluated the impacts of multiple stressors on animal mortality in freshwater, marine and terrestrial communities. We found that, on average, mortalities from the combined action of two stressors were not synergistic and this result was consistent across studies investigating different stressors, study organisms and life-history stages. Furthermore, only one-third of relevant experiments displayed truly synergistic effects, which does not support the prevailing ecological paradigm that synergies are rampant.

Although inbreeding has been shown to have a detrimental impact on individual fitness, its contribution to extinction is still poorly understood. We have studied the consequences of different levels of prior inbreeding for the persistence of small populations using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. To this end, we determined the extinction rate of small vial populations differing in the level of inbreeding under both optimal and stress conditions, i.e. high temperature stress and ethanol stress. We show that inbred populations have a significantly higher short-term probability of extinction than non-inbred populations, even for low levels of inbreeding, and that the extinction probability increases with increasing inbreeding levels. In addition, we observed that the effects of inbreeding become greatly enhanced under stressful environmental conditions. More importantly, our results show that the impact of environmental stress becomes significantly greater for higher inbreeding levels, demonstrating explicitly that inbreeding and environmental stress are not independent but can act synergistically. These effects seem long lasting as the impact of prior inbreeding was still qualitatively the same after the inbred populations had been expanded to appreciable numbers and maintained as such for approximately 50 generations.

Most current theories and analytical models in community ecology assume that responses are unimodal and symmetric. However, interactions between species and extreme environmental stress may cause skewed or non-unimodal responses. To date, statistical tools for evaluating response shapes have been either inappropriate, inefficient or biased. Using a data set on vascular plant distributions along an elevation gradient, we show that Huisman-Olff-Fresco (HOF) models are an effective method for this purpose, allowing models of various forms (skewed, symmetric, plateau, monotonic) to be tested for adequacy. HOF modeling was compared with alternative methods for response fitting, including Gaussian responses as Generalized linear model (GLMs), Generalized Additive Models (GAM) and Beta Functions with fixed or estimated endpoints. In our data set, skewed and plateau responses are less common than symmetric ones. Less than half of the species have skewed or plateau responses that can not be adequately modeled by Gaussian models. We show that Beta function models with fixed endpoints are biased, confounding skewness and the location of the mode and should not be used to test response shapes. Beta models with estimated endpoints are fairly consistent with other models. GAM's cannot provide clear tests of skewness or kurtosis of response curves, though we show that GAM's, in general, confirmed the shapes chosen by HOF modeling.

Few coordinated across-scale comparisons have been made using data of different resolutions and geographic extents. Here, we assess whether climate change-induced habitat losses predicted at the European scale (10 x 10' grid cells) are also predicted from local-scale data and modeling (25 m x 25 m grid cells) in two regions of the Swiss Alps. We show that local-scale models predict persistence of suitable habitats in up to 100% of species that were predicted by a European-scale model to lose all their suitable habitats in the area. Proportion of habitat loss depends on climate change scenario and study area. We find good agreement between the mismatch in predictions between scales and the fine-grain elevation range within 10 x 10' cells.

The experimental design allowed reductions in vegetative and reproductive vigor resulting from interspecific competition to be distinguished from those arising from direct effects of nutrient stress and vegetation disturbance. It was also possible to determine the extent to which competitive suppression of each species was affected by stress and disturbance. In isolation, all species showed maximum vegetative and reproductive vigor at high soil fertility and low disturbance. In the mixture, absolute reductions in biomass and flowering due to competition were greatest at high soil fertility and low disturbance, and the species of most extreme strategy became restricted to areas of the matrix broadly consistent with those predicted by strategy classification. When standardized for differences in biomass in pure stands, the effect of competition remained relatively constant across the stress-disturbance matrix for all species except Poa annua, which was less restricted by competition at high intensities of stress. There were marked and consistent differences between species in their susceptibility to competition. At both high and low soil fertility, two species of natural occurrence on infertile soils (Festuca ovina, Bromus erectus) were poor competitors relative to Arrhenatherum elatius, a widespread dominant of productive grasslands. The effect of competition was least severe on flowering of annuals in low-stress portions of the matrix. If competition is assessed simply as the percentage of reduction in biomass between pure and mixed stands it appears that competition intensity is constant across different intensities of stress and disturbance. However, observations that maximum reductions in biomass coincided with low stress and low disturbance, that competition decreased in importance as a factor reducing yield and flowering (relative to stress and disturbance) as stress and disturbance intensities increased, and that there was a consistently inferior competitive ability of plants from infertile soils at all positions on the matrix all support the hypothesis that competition declines in importance as a vegetation determinant in the vegetation of infertile soils.",169,1992,73,1,15,29"Relyea, R; Hoverman, J",Assessing the ecology in ecotoxicology: a review and synthesis in freshwater systems,ECOLOGY LETTERS,Review,"The field of ecotoxicology is experiencing a surge in attention among ecologists as we gain a deeper appreciation for how contaminants can impact natural ecosystems.

These include (1) investigating the effects of non-random species loss through the manipulation of the order and magnitude of such loss using dilution experiments; (2) combining factorial manipulation of diversity in interconnected habitat patches to test the additivity of ecosystem functioning between habitats; (3) disentangling the impact of local processes from the effect of ecosystem openness via factorial manipulation of the rate of recruitment and biodiversity within patches and within an available propagule pool; and (4) addressing how non-random species extinction following sequential exposure to different stressors may affect ecosystem functioning. Implementing these kinds of experimental designs in a variety of systems will, we believe, shift the focus of investigations from a species richness-centred approach to a broader consideration of the multifarious aspects of biodiversity that may well be critical to understanding effects of biodiversity changes on overall ecosystem functioning and to identifying some of the potential underlying mechanisms involved.",165,2004,104,3,423,436"Folke, C; Holling, CS; Perrings, C","Biological diversity, ecosystems, and the human scale",ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,Article,"This paper considers the significance of biological diversity in relation to large-scale processes in complex and dynamic ecological-economic systems.

Within functional groups of organisms two important categories of species are identified: keystone process species and those essential for ecosystem resilience. The latter group represents ''natural insurance capital.'' In addition to basic research on the interplay among biological diversity, functional performance, and resilience in complex self-organizing systems, we suggest that a functional approach has two main implications for a strategy for biodiversity conservation: (1) Biodiversity conservation to assure the resilience of ecosystems is required for all systems, no matter how heavily impacted they are. It should not be limited to protected areas. (2) The social, cultural, and economic driving forces in society that cause biodiversity loss need to be addressed directly. Specifically, (a) differences between the value of biological diversity to the private individual and its fundamental value to society as a whole need to be removed; (b) social and economic policies that encourage biodiversity loss should be reformed, especially where there is a risk of irreversible damage to ecosystems and diversity; and (c) institutions that are adaptive and work in synergy with ecosystem processes and functions are critical and should be created at all levels.",162,1996,6,4,1018,1024"Laurance, WF",Theory meets reality: How habitat fragmentation research has transcended island biogeographic theory,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,Review,"Island biogeography theory (IBT) provides a basic conceptual model for understanding habitat fragmentation. Empirical studies of fragmented landscapes often reveal strong effects of fragment area and isolation on species richness, although other predictions of the theory, such as accelerated species turnover in fragments, have been tested less frequently. As predicted by IBT, biota in fragments typically 'relax' over time towards lower species richness. Beyond these broad generalizations, however, the relevance of IBT for understanding fragmented ecosystems is limited. First, IBT provides few predictions about how community composition in fragments should change over time, and which species should be most vulnerable. Second, edge effects can be an important driver of local species extinctions and ecosystem change, but are not considered by IBT. Third, the matrix of modified vegetation surrounding fragments-also ignored by IBT-can strongly influence fragment connectivity, which in turn affects the demography, genetics, and survival of local populations. Fourth, most fragmented landscapes are also altered by other anthropogenic changes, such as hunting, logging, fires, and pollution, which can interact synergistically with habitat fragmentation. Finally, fragmentation often has diverse impacts on ecosystem properties such as canopy-gap dynamics, carbon storage, and the trophic structure of communities that are not considered by IBT.

Today, every region of the planet is simultaneously affected and modern rates of invasion are several orders of magnitude higher than prehistoric rates. In terms of its rate and geographical extent, its potential for synergistic disruption and the scope of its evolutionary consequences, the current mass invasion event is without precedent and should be regarded as a unique form of global change. Prehistoric examples of biotic interchanges are nonetheless instructive and can increase our understanding of species-area effects, evolutionary effects, biotic resistance to invasion, and the impacts of novel functional groups introduced to naive biotas.

Over the past 32 years, Amazonian forest fragments ranging from 1 to 100 ha have experienced a wide array of ecological changes. Edge effects have been a dominant driver of fragment dynamics, strongly affecting forest microclimate, tree mortality, carbon storage, fauna, and other aspects of fragment ecology. However, edge-effect intensity varies markedly in space and time, and is influenced by factors such as edge age, the number of nearby edges, and the adjoining matrix of modified vegetation surrounding fragments. In our study area, the matrix has changed markedly over the course of the study (evolving from large cattle pastures to mosaics of abandoned pasture and regrowth forest) and this in turn has strongly influenced fragment dynamics and faunal persistence. Rare weather events, especially windstorms and droughts, have further altered fragment ecology. In general, populations and communities of species in fragments are hyperdynamic relative to nearby intact forest. Some edge and fragment-isolation effects have declined with a partial recovery of secondary forests around fragments, but other changes: such as altered patterns of tree recruitment, are ongoing. Fragments are highly sensitive to external vicissitudes, and even small changes in local land-management practices may drive fragmented ecosystems in markedly different directions. The effects of fragmentation are likely to interact synergistically with other anthropogenic threats such as logging, hunting, and especially fire, creating an even greater peril for the Amazonian biota.

Studies in the wild and in gardens with synthetic crosses showed that hybrid eucalypts supported the greatest species richness and abundances of insect and fungal taxa. In an updated review of 152 case studies of taxa associated with diverse hybridizing systems, there were 43 (28%) cases of hybrids being more susceptible than their parent species, 7 (5%) resistant, 35 (23%) additive, 35 (23%) dominant, and 32 (21%) showed no response to hybridization. Thus, most taxa respond to hybrids in ways that result in equal or greater abundance, and hybrids tend to accumulate the taxa of their parent species. These studies suggest that genetic-based plant traits affect the distribution of many species and that the variation in hybrids can be used as tools to examine the genetic components of community structure and biodiversity. Several patterns have emerged thus far. (1) Genetic variation between classes of hybrids (e.g., F(1)'s vs. backcrosses) may equal or even exceed that found between species. (2) As a reflection of this genetic variation, herbivores are more likely to differentiate between hybrid classes than they are to differentiate between pure plant species. (3) The communities associated with different hybrid classes can differ from one another as well as from their parental species. (4) Generalist and specialist herbivores predictably vary in their responses to hybrids. (5) Plant hybrid zones may represent essential habitat for some arthropod species. (6) Even nesting birds respond to hybridizing plants. (7) Including multiple trophic levels and taxa from microbes to vertebrates, susceptible hybrid genotypes support greater biodiversity than resistant genotypes. (8) The effects of hybridization on common or keystone species can either positively or negatively affect biodiversity. The indirect impacts of hybridization on biodiversity may exceed the direct impacts and may result in ""apparent"" herbivore resistance or susceptibility at the community level. (9) Although hybrids are often maligned, exotic or problem hybrids generally result from human disturbances, whereas native hybrids are part of natural ecosystems and should be conserved. Three predictions are made: (1) Intermediate genetic differences between the parental species will result in the greatest genetic variation in the hybrid zone, which in turn will have a positive effect on biodiversity. (2) Bidirectional introgression enhances species richness on hybrids, whereas F(1) sterility and unidirectional introgression limit the accumulation of species on hybrids.

Carry-over effects occur when processes in one season influence the success of an individual in the following season. This phenomenon has the potential to explain a large amount of variation in individual fitness, but so far has only been described in a limited number of species. This is largely due to difficulties associated with tracking individuals between periods of the annual cycle, but also because of a lack of research specifically designed to examine hypotheses related to carry-over effects. 2. We review the known mechanisms that drive carry-over effects, most notably macronutrient supply, and highlight the types of life histories and ecological situations where we would expect them to most often occur. We also identify a number of other potential mechanisms that require investigation, including micronutrients such as antioxidants. 3. We propose a series of experiments designed to estimate the relative contributions of extrinsic and intrinsic quality effects in the pre-breeding season, which in turn will allow an accurate estimation of the magnitude of carry-over effects. To date this has proven immensely difficult, and we hope that the experimental frameworks described here will stimulate new avenues of research vital to advancing our understanding of how carry-over effects can shape animal life histories. 4. We also explore the potential of state-dependent modelling as a tool for investigating carry-over effects, most notably for its ability to calculate optimal rates of acquisition of a multitude of resources over the course of the annual cycle, and also because it allows us to vary the strength of density-dependent relationships which can alter the magnitude of carry-over effects in either a synergistic or agonistic fashion. 5. In conclusion carry-over effects are likely to be far more widespread than currently indicated, and they are likely to be driven by a multitude of factors including both macro- and micronutrients. For this reason they could feasibly be responsible for a large amount of the observed variation in performance among individuals, and consequently warrant a wealth of new research designed specifically to decompose components of variation in fitness attributes related to processes across and within seasons.",138,2011,80,1,4,18"Reusch, TBH; Wood, TE",Molecular ecology of global change,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,Review,"Global environmental change is altering the selection regime for all biota. The key selective factors are altered mean, variance and seasonality of climatic variables and increase in CO2 concentration itself. We review recent studies that document rapid evolution to global climate change at the phenotypic and genetic level, as a response to shifts in these factors. Among the traits that have changed are photoperiod responses, stress tolerance and traits associated with enhanced dispersal. The genetic basis of two traits with a critical role under climate change, stress tolerance and photoperiod behaviour, is beginning to be understood for model organisms, providing a starting point for candidate gene approaches in targeted nonmodel species. Most studies that have documented evolutionary change are correlative, while selection experiments that manipulate relevant variables are rare. The latter are particularly valuable for prediction because they provide insight into heritable change to simulated future conditions. An important gap is that experimental selection regimes have mostly been testing one variable at a time, while synergistic interactions are likely under global change. The expanding toolbox available to molecular ecologists holds great promise for identifying the genetic basis of many more traits relevant to fitness under global change. Such knowledge, in turn, will significantly advance predictions on global change effects because presence and polymorphism of critical genes can be directly assessed. Moreover, knowledge of the genetic architecture of trait correlations will provide the necessary framework for understanding limits to phenotypic evolution; in particular as lack of critical gene polymorphism or entire pathways, metabolic costs of tolerance and linkage or pleiotropy causing negative trait correlations. Synergism among stressor impacts on organismal function may be causally related to conflict among transcriptomic syndromes specific to stressor types. Because adaptation to changing environment is always contingent upon the spatial distribution of genetic variation, high-resolution estimates of gene flow and hybridization should be used to inform predictions of evolutionary rates.",138,2007,16,19,3973,3992"Relyea, RA",Predator cues and pesticides: A double dose of danger for amphibians,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,Article,"Amphibians are declining globally, and biologists have struggled to identify the causes. Pesticides may play a role in these declines, but pesticide concentrations in nature often are low and considered sublethal. Past research has found that the globally common pesticide carbaryl can become more lethal under different environmental conditions including differences in temperature and competition. A recent study has found, that predatory stress, a situation common for most amphibians, can make carbaryl 2-4 times more deadly to gray tree frogs (Hyla versicolor). To determine whether this is a general phenomenon in amphibians, I examined how carbaryl affected the survival of six amphibian species in the presence and absence of predatory stress. Higher concentrations of carbaryl caused higher mortality. In two of the six species, carbaryl became even more lethal when combined with predatory stress (up to 46 times more lethal). This suggests that apparently safe concentrations of carbaryl (and perhaps other pesticides with similar modes of action) can become more deadly to some amphibian species when combined with predator cues.",138,2003,13,6,1515,1521"LEROI, AM; CHIPPINDALE, AK; ROSE, MR",LONG-TERM LABORATORY EVOLUTION OF A GENETIC LIFE-HISTORY TRADE-OFF IN DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER .1.

Here we report the disappearance of a trade-off between early fecundity on the one hand, and late-life fecundity, starvation resistance, and longevity on the other, over 10 yr of laboratory selection for late-life reproduction. Whereas the selected populations showed an initial depression in early-life fecundity, they later converged upon the controls and then surpassed them. The evolutionary loss of the trade-off among life-history traits is considered attributable to the following factors: (1) the existence of differences in the culture regimes of the short- and long-generation populations other than the demographic differences deliberately imposed; (2) adaptation of one or both of these sets of populations to the unique aspects of their culture regimes; (3) the existence of an among-environment trade-off in the expression of early fecundity in the two culture regimes, as reflected in assays that mimic those regimes. The trade-off between early and late-life reproductive success, as manifest among divergently selected populations, is apparent or not depending on the assay environment.

This hypothesis was originally proposed to explain synergistic (inseparable) food and predator effects on demography in snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus). We conducted a 2 x 2, manipulative food addition plus natural predator reduction experiment on song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) that was, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate comparable synergistic effects in a bird: added food and lower predator pressure in combination produced an increase in annual reproductive success almost double that expected from an additive model.

This paper discusses the synergies between these changes and their implications to the most vulnerable ecosystems, such as mountain and semiarid ecosystems, and compares current desertification processes in the area's north and south.

Finally, this paper discusses western Mediterranean irrigated lands as hot spots of desertification; their vulnerability to rainfall variability; the difficulties of relieving them from overexploitation of water resources; and their terminal symptoms, such as soil salinization, exhaustion and deterioration of aquifers, and damage to downstream fluvial and wetland systems.

Further, the extent to which network metrics characterise the spatiotemporally-variable dynamic structure of interacting communities is unknown. Here, we summarise the attributes of web structure that are predicted to confer stability or increased function to a system, as these may be of greatest interest to conservation biologists. However, empirical evaluation of these effects is lacking in most cases, and we discuss whether stability is even desirable in all contexts. The incorporation of web attributes into conservation monitoring requires that changes in these attributes can be recorded (sampled) with relative ease. We contrast the sensitivity of metrics to sampling effort, and highlight those (such as nestedness and connectance) that could easily be incorporated into conservation monitoring.

Responses are often variable among species within groups making general predictions difficult. One option is to include ecological trait information that might help to disentangle patterns of response and also provide greater understanding of how particular traits link whole clades to their environment. Although this ""trait-guild"" approach has been used for single disturbances, the importance of particular traits on general responses to multiple disturbances has not been explored. We used a mixed model analysis of 19 data sets from throughout the world to test the effect of ecological and life-history traits on the responses of bee species to different types of anthropogenic environmental change. These changes included habitat loss, fragmentation, agricultural intensification, pesticides and fire. Individual traits significantly affected bee species responses to different disturbances and several traits were broadly predictive among multiple disturbances. The location of nests - above vs. below ground - significantly affected response to habitat loss, agricultural intensification, tillage regime (within agriculture) and fire. Species that nested above ground were on average more negatively affected by isolation from natural habitat and intensive agricultural land use than were species nesting below ground. In contrast below-ground-nesting species were more negatively affected by tilling than were above-ground nesters. The response of different nesting guilds to fire depended on the time since the burn. Social bee species were more strongly affected by isolation from natural habitat and pesticides than were solitary bee species. Surprisingly, body size did not consistently affect species responses, despite its importance in determining many aspects of individuals' interaction with their environment. Although synergistic interactions among traits remain to be explored, individual traits can be useful in predicting and understanding responses of related species to global change.

Research on senescence has largely focused on its underlying causes, and is concentrated on humans and relatively few model organisms in laboratory conditions. To understand the evolutionary ecology of senescence, research on a broader taxonomic range is needed, incorporating field, and, where possible, longitudinal studies. 2. Senescence is generally considered to involve progressive deterioration in performance, and it is important to distinguish this from other age-related phenotypic changes. We outline and discuss the main explanations of why selection has not eliminated senescence, and summarise the principal mechanisms thought to be involved. 3. The main focus of research on senescence is on age-related changes in mortality risk. However, evolutionary biologists focus on fitness, of which survival is only one component. To understand the selective pressures shaping senescence patterns, more attention needs to be devoted to age-related changes in fecundity. 4. Both genetic and environmental factors influence the rate of senescence. However, a much clearer distinction needs to be drawn between life span and senescence rate, and between factors that alter the overall risk of death, and factors that alter the rate of senescence. This is particularly important when considering the potential reversibility and plasticity of senescence, and environmental effects, such as circumstances early in life. 5.

Consequently, increasing liana abundance and biomass have potentially profound ramifications for tropical forest composition and functioning. Currently, eight studies support the pattern of increasing liana abundance and biomass in American tropical and subtropical forests, whereas two studies, both from Africa, do not. The putative mechanisms to explain increasing lianas include increasing evapotranspirative demand, increasing forest disturbance and turnover, changes in land use and fragmentation and elevated atmospheric CO2. Each of these mechanisms probably contributes to the observed patterns of increasing liana abundance and biomass, and the mechanisms are likely to be interrelated and synergistic.

The chase-away hypothesis proposes that sexual conflict promotes sexually antagonistic, rather than mutualistic, coevolution, whereby manipulative reproductive strategies in one sex are counteracted by the evolution of resistance to such strategies in the other sex. In this paper, we consider the criteria necessary to demonstrate the chase-away hypothesis. Specifically, we review sexual conflict with particular emphasis on the chase-away hypothesis; discuss the problems associated with testing the predictions of the chase-away hypothesis and the extent to which these predictions and the predictions of traditional models of sexual selection are mutually exclusive; discuss misconceptions and mismeasures of sexual conflict; and suggest an alternative approach to demonstrate sexual conflict, measure the intensity of sexually antagonistic selection in a population, and elucidate the coevolutionary trajectories of the sexes.",109,2003,57,6,1223,1236"BACON, CW","ABIOTIC STRESS TOLERANCES (MOISTURE, NUTRIENTS) AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN ENDOPHYTE-INFECTED TALL FESCUE",AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,Article; Proceedings Paper,"The ecological significance resulting from the association of each tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) genotype and its companion fungal endophyte (Acremonium coenophialum Morgan-Jones and Gams) is probably inherent in the nutritional interactions, and the resulting physiological and biochemical requirements of each. The colonization of this grass by the fungus follows the natural sequence of fescue seed germination, seedling and tiller growth. Infected grasses are natural and extensive, therefore tall fescue should be considered a symbiotic plant. The nature of this relationship at the population level is more appropriately described as an obligately biotrophic conjunctive mutualism. The use of this terminology at the population level describes the overall ecological effect; however, allowances must be made for infected tall fescue genotypes within the population that may not show any positive adaptive strategies. Genotypes of this later category may be categorized, possibly only transiently, as obligately neutral symbiotic. Infected genotypes of the earlier category offer adaptations to environmental stresses and may be exploited for these characteristics. Evidence from research is reviewed to indicate that selected genotypes within the population of tall fescue are more tolerant of environmental abiotic stresses than uninfected grasses. Infected tall fescue seed require more moisture to germinate than uninfected seed. Endophyte-infected seedlings require more nutrients than uninfected seedlings. Although infected tall fescue contains less soluble nitrogen which would encourage more predation, strains resulting from the stresses of insect herbivory are prevented because of an accumulation of an insect deterrent, toxins and their synergists. At the morphological level infected grasses show tolerance to water stress by early shedding of older leaves and rolling of younger leaves. Tolerance to water stress is further evidenced by low stomatal conductances and by development of an enhanced osmoregulatory system that produces increased cellular turgor pressure. One genotype of tall fescue contains polyols, some of which are absent in the uninfected clone. Infected tall fescue also shows increased efficiency to low soil nitrogen, possibly due to an increased level of glutamine synthetase which would enhance its competitive ability under low soil nitrogen. There is no endophyte effect of consequence on photosynthesis and associated processes in several genotypes of infected grasses.",109,1993,44,04-Jan,123,141"Elith, J; Leathwick, J",Predicting species distributions from museum and herbarium records using multiresponse models fitted with multivariate adaptive regression splines,DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,Article; Proceedings Paper,"Current circumstances - that the majority of species distribution records exist as presence-only data (e.g. from museums and herbaria), and that there is an established need for predictions of species distributions - mean that scientists and conservation managers seek to develop robust methods for using these data. Such methods must, in particular, accommodate the difficulties caused by lack of reliable information about sites where species are absent. Here we test two approaches for overcoming these difficulties, analysing a range of data sets using the technique of multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). MARS is closely related to regression techniques such as generalized additive models (GAMs) that are commonly and successfully used in modelling species distributions, but has particular advantages in its analytical speed and the ease of transfer of analysis results to other computational environments such as a Geographic Information System. MARS also has the advantage that it can model multiple responses, meaning that it can combine information from a set of species to determine the dominant environmental drivers of variation in species composition. We use data from 226 species from six regions of the world, and demonstrate the use of MARS for distribution modelling using presence-only data. We test whether (1) the type of data used to represent absence or background and (2) the signal from multiple species affect predictive performance, by evaluating predictions at completely independent sites where genuine presence-absence data were recorded. Models developed with absences inferred from the total set of presence-only sites for a biological group, and using simultaneous analysis of multiple species to inform the choice of predictor variables, performed better than models in which species were analysed singly, or in which pseudo-absences were drawn randomly from the study area. The methods are fast, relatively simple to understand, and useful for situations where data are limited.

From an ecological perspective, exposure to one stress may alter the Plant's probability of being exposed to another stress. From a mechanistic perspective, hormonal and biochemical signaling interactions between responses to each stress may influence the severity or ability to adaptively respond to the subsequent stress. In this article, we consider the relationship between plant water and salt stress and attack by pathogens and herbivores. Empirical data suggest that water stress and the probability of attack by pathogens and herbivores are correlated between habitats. Biochemical interactions between plant responses to water and salt stress and insect. and pathogen attack are also interrelated. Initial biochemical models indicated that abscisic acid (ABA), an important hormone in responses to water and salt stress, had a synergistic positive role with jasmonate-induced defenses against herbivores and an,antagonistic role with salicylate-based resistance to some pathogens. Based on this background, we developed predictions about how water and salt stress would alter plant resistance to insects and pathogens and tested the predictions using tomato plants as a model system. We: used polyphenol oxidase activity as a marker of the jasmonate response and, pathogenesis-related protein P4 as a marker of the salicylate response. First, we examined levels of chemical defense in wild-type and ABA-deficient plants and the ability of these plants to resist insect and pathogen attack. In the second experiment, we exposed plants to short-term salinity stress and tested their subsequent resistance to a chewing. insect Spodoptera exigua and the bacterial speck pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. We have two key findings. First, ABA-deficient plants had higher levels of salicylate-mediated responses and were more resistant to bacterial speck disease, consistent with the proposed role of salicylate in defense against pathogens. This suggests linkage between water availability to the plant and salicylate action in pathogenesis through ABA signaling. ABA-deficient plants had reduced resistance to the insect Spodoptera exigua, suggesting a positive correlation between responses to water stress and herbivory. The lack of difference in chemical expression of the jasmonate (JA) response (polyphenol oxidase activity) between wild-type and ABA-deficient plants did not support the proposed mechanism of synergism with the jasmonate response. Second, salt stress reduced the chemical induction, (e.g., pathogenesis-related protein P4) of the salicylate response, but this did not affect resistance to the pathogen. Salt stress did not alter resistance to the herbivore Trichoplusia ni, but did alter the negative signal interaction between the jasmonate and salicylate responses. Under control conditions, the jasmonate and salicylate responses are antagonistic to one another, with induction of one response reducing the inducibility of the other. Under salt stress conditions, the negative effect of salicylate on the jasmonate response was reduced. Thus, complex interactions occur between. ABA, JA, and SA, hormones that are important regulators of abiotic and biotic stress responses.

These efforts have been, however, modest in marine ecosystems. An examination of seagrass communities, which are simple assemblages with a limited membership of about 50 species worldwide and < 12 species in any one community, provides, however, strong evidence for the existence of such positive link between species richness and ecosystem functions. Ecosystem functions are, however, dependent on the particular membership of the community, rather that its number, for the functions are species-specific properties. Yet evidence, is provided, that an increasing species richness should be, on average, linked to an increase in the functional repertoire present in the community, will lead to a more efficient use of resources and a greater capacity to ensure the sustainability of ecosystem functions under disturbance or ecosystem change. Closer examination indicates that the functional variability of mixed-species seagrass assemblages is correlated to the variability in species size, whereas species of similar size tend to show similar functional capacities and, therefore, a greater degree of functional redundancy. In addition, the demonstration of positive interactions in seagrass communities, which are also dependent on the presence of engineering species in the community that facilitate the growth of other species, provides increasing grounds to expect an enhanced functional performance of mixed communities over that expected from a simple additive contribution of the community members. Multispecific communities also hold, within the functional repertoire they contain, many unrealised functional potentials that may prove instrumental to ensure the sustainability of ecosystem functions in the presence of disturbance or a changing environment. The arguments offered, illustrated for the comparatively simple seagrass communities, provide strong reasons to expect a strong - if difficult to test experimentally - positive relationship between species diversity and the functions of marine ecosystems and, thereby, the services they yield to humanity.

We investigated the evolution of desiccation stress resistance using 20 outbred Drosophila melanogaster populations directly selected in the laboratory for adult desiccation resistance (D), postponed senescence (O), and their respective controls (C and B). Both aging and desiccation selection increased desiccation resistance relative to their controls, creating a spectrum of desiccation resistance levels across selection treatments. We employed integrative approach, merging data on the life histories of these populations with a detailed physiology of water balance. The physiological basis of desiccation resistance may be mechanisms enhancing either resource conservation or resource acquisition and allocation. Desiccation-resistant populations had increased water and carbohydrate stores, and showed age-specific patterns of desiccation resistance consistent with the resource accumulation mechanism. A significant proportion of the resources relevant to resistance of the stress were accumulated in the larval stage. Males and females of desiccation-selected lines exhibited distinctly different patterns of desiccation resistance and resource acquisition, in a manner suggesting intersexual antagonism in the evolution of stress resistance. Preadult viability of stress-selected populations was lower than that of controls, and development was slowed.

We recently documented by means of microsatellite analysis that the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) is not panmictic but instead shows genetic isolation by distance. In this study, we extended the analysis to the American eel (A. rostrata) by applying identical analytical procedures and statistical power. Results obtained for the American eel were in sharp contrast with those obtained for the European eel: the null hypothesis of panmixia could not be rejected, and no isolation by distance was detected. This implies that the species must be managed as a single population. Using Bayesian statistics, we also found that the effective population sizes for both species were surprisingly low and that the populations had undergone severe contractions, most probably during the Wisconsinan glaciation. The apparent sensitivity of eels to climatic changes affecting the strength and position of the Gulf Stream 20 000 years ago is particularly worrying, given the effects of the ongoing global warming on the North Atlantic climate. Moreover, additional short-term stresses such as surging glass eel prizes, overfishing and lethal parasitic infections negatively affect eel population size. The fascinating transatlantic migration and life cycle of Atlantic eels is also their Achilles' heel as these negative short- and long-term effects will probably culminate in a fatal synergy if drastic conservation measures are not implemented to protect these international biological resources.",99,2003,270,1516,681,688"Ives, AR; Klug, JL; Gross, K",Stability and species richness in complex communities,ECOLOGY LETTERS,Article,"Using both numerical simulations and analytical methods, we investigate how the stability of ecological communities depends on the number of species they contain. To investigate complex communities, we construct communities from modular ""subcommunities"" that can have arbitrary community structure; e.g. subcommunities could consist of pairs of predator and prey species, trios of prey, specialist predator and generalist predator, or any collection of interacting species. By building entire communities from subcommunities, we can change the number of species in the community without changing community structure. We further suppose that species sharing the same ecological role in different subcommunities act additively on the per capita population growth rates of other species. Under these assumptions, the interactions between species from different subcommunities have no effect on community-level stability, measured by the variability in the combined densities of species sharing the same ecological role in different subcommunities. Furthermore, increasing species richness (i.e. the number of subcommunities comprising the community) increases community-level stability only when it introduces species that respond differently to environmental fluctuations. Therefore, our results support the ""insurance hypothesis"" that species richness increases community-level stability by insuring that some species in a community are tolerant of different environmental fluctuations.",97,2000,3,5,399,411"MULKEY, SS; PEARCY, RW","INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ACCLIMATION AND PHOTOINHIBITION OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS OF A TROPICAL FOREST UNDERSTOREY HERB, ALOCASIA-MACRORRHIZA, DURING SIMULATED CANOPY GAP FORMATION",FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,Article,"1. The effects of a sudden increase in irradiance and the high leaf temperatures characteristic of a canopy gap environment were studied with chlorophyll fluorescence and gas-exchange measurements on shade- and sun-acclimated leaves of Alocasia macrorrhiza. 2. Photoinhibition occurred in both sun and shade leaves during a 2-h simulated gap treatment (1900 mumol photons m-2 s-1) in which leaf temperatures rose to 40-degrees-C. Dissipation of excess energy was more efficient in sun leaves, which showed rapid quenching of fluorescence. The quantum yield of photosystem II as calculated from fluorescence in low light was considerably lower for shade than sun leaves after the gap treatment. 3. Fluorescence relaxation kinetics showed that sun leaves recovered overnight from photoinhibition even when leaf temperatures during treatment reached 40-degrees-C. By contrast, shade leaves given the same treatment had not recovered after 4 days in low light. Shade leaves given the same light treatment but held at 30-degrees-C instead of 40-degrees-C recovered within 4 days. Shade leaves treated at 40-degrees-C in moderate, saturating light (375 mumol photons m-2 s-1) recovered overnight. Thirteen days of 3-h gap treatments on whole plants previously grown in shade showed that after initial depressions both fluorescence and photosynthetic capacity partially recovered. 4. Thus, the degree of photoinhibition and the potential for recovery are dependent on the synergistic roles of leaf temperatures and high light during initial gap conditions. Although quantum efficiency and photosynthetic capacity can be impaired by strong light and heat stress, shade leaves have significant capacity for repair and contribution to the whole-plant carbon budget during acclimation following gap formation.",96,1992,6,6,719,729"Relyea, RA; Schoeppner, NM; Hoverman, JT",Pesticides and amphibians: The importance of community context,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,Article,"The widespread application of pesticides has attracted the attention of ecologists as we struggle to understand the impacts of these chemicals on natural communities. While we have a large number of laboratory-based, single-species studies of pesticides, such studies can only examine direct effects. However, in natural communities, species can experience both direct and indirect effects. We conducted an outdoor mesocosm experiment on aquatic communities containing three tadpole species (Hyla versicolor, Bufo americanus, and Rana pipiens), zooplankton, and algae. We then manipulated a factorial combination of predators (no predators; newts, Notophthalmus viridescens; and larval beetles, Dytiscus sp.) and pesticides (no pesticides, the insecticide malathion, and the herbicide Roundup). We found that Roundup (1.3 mg of active ingredient/L) had substantial direct negative effects on the tadpoles, reducing total tadpole. survival and biomass by 40%. However, Roundup had no indirect effects on the amphibian community via predator survival or algal abundance. Malathion (0.3 mg/L) had few direct effects on the tadpoles. Malathion caused no indirect effects with one of the predators (red-spotted newts) but caused substantial positive effects on amphibians (a five-fold increase in total tadpole survival and biomass) due to the sensitivity of the predatory beetles to the insecticide. Thus, while high concentrations of malathion can directly kill larval anurans, more ecologically relevant concentrations can have large positive effects in mesocosms by removing predatory insects. These results make it clear that pesticides can have both direct and indirect effects in natural communities and that these effects critically depend upon the composition of the community.",93,2005,15,4,1125,1134"Morgan, TJ; Mackay, TFC",Quantitative trait loci for thermotolerance phenotypes in Drosophila melanogaster,HEREDITY,Article,"For insects, temperature is a major environmental variable that can influence an individual's behavioral activities and fitness. Drosophila melanogaster is a cosmopolitan species that has had great success in adapting to and colonizing diverse thermal niches. This adaptation and colonization has resulted in complex patterns of genetic variation in thermotolerance phenotypes in nature. Although extensive work has been conducted documenting patterns of genetic variation, substantially less is known about the genomic regions or genes that underlie this ecologically and evolutionarily important genetic variation. To begin to understand and identify the genes controlling thermotolerance phenotypes, we have used a mapping population of recombinant inbred (RI) lines to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) that affect variation in both heat- and cold-stress resistance. The mapping population was derived from a cross between two lines of D. melanogaster (Oregon-R and 2b) that were not selected for thermotolerance phenotypes, but exhibit significant genetic divergence for both phenotypes. Using a design in which each RI line was backcrossed to both parental lines, we mapped seven QTL affecting thermotolerance on the second and third chromosomes. Three of the QTL influence cold-stress resistance and four affect heat- stress resistance. Most of the QTL were trait or sex specific, suggesting that overlapping but generally unique genetic architectures underlie resistance to low- and high-temperature extremes. Each QTL explained between 5 and 14% of the genetic variance among lines, and degrees of dominance ranged from completely additive to partial dominance. Potential thermotolerance candidate loci contained within our QTL regions are identified and discussed.",92,2006,96,3,232,242"Russell, BD; Thompson, JAI; Falkenberg, LJ; Connell, SD",Synergistic effects of climate change and local stressors: CO2 and nutrient-driven change in subtidal rocky habitats,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Article,"Climate-driven change represents the cumulative effect of global through local-scale conditions, and understanding their manifestation at local scales can empower local management. Change in the dominance of habitats is often the product of local nutrient pollution that occurs at relatively local scales (i.e. catchment scale), a critical scale of management at which global impacts will manifest. We tested whether forecasted global-scale change [elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) and subsequent ocean acidification] and local stressors (elevated nutrients) can combine to accelerate the expansion of filamentous turfs at the expense of calcifying algae (kelp understorey). Our results not only support this model of future change, but also highlight the synergistic effects of future CO2 and nutrient concentrations on the abundance of turfs. These results suggest that global and local stressors need to be assessed in meaningful combinations so that the anticipated effects of climate change do not create the false impression that, however complex, climate change will produce smaller effects than reality. These findings empower local managers because they show that policies of reducing local stressors (e.g. nutrient pollution) can reduce the effects of global stressors not under their governance (e.g. ocean acidification).

While increasing attention has lately been paid to social sustainability, the interaction between the 'environmental' and the 'social' still remains a largely uncharted terrain. Nevertheless, one can argue that the key challenges of sustainable development reside at the interfaces-synergies and trade-offs-between its various dimensions. This paper looks for preliminary ideas on frameworks for analysing the environmental-social interface. It first discusses the concept of sustainable development and the relations of the three dimensions of sustainability on the basis of the fundamental premises of neoinstitutional and ecological economics, and briefly presents the 'bioeconomy model'. Based on this conceptualisation of sustainable development, it then goes on to analyse two popular ways of addressing the social dimension of sustainability, namely, the 'capability approach' of Amartya Sen, and the concept of social capital, and discusses the potential of these as bases for the analysis of the environment-social interaction. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Environmental Performance Review (EPR) programme is presented as an example of attempts to analyse the environmental-social interface in practice. The paper concludes by noting that a single framework for studying environmental-social interface is neither feasible nor desirable. It questions the usefulness of analysing only two dimensions of sustainability at a time; and emphasises the need to situate the analysis in its context. In particular, it stresses the need to involve the potential users, as well as to take into account the planned use of the analysis and the interactions between different levels of analysis and decision-making. Capabilities and social capital can both be useful in structuring thoughts, but are not as such directly applicable as suitable analytical frameworks. In particular, they do not provide adequate tools for examining the social preconditions for institutional change needed for environmentally sustainable development. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, the ecological and geographic scenarios under which pollinator transitions occur are poorly understood, and the underlying genetic factors are just beginning to be uncovered for a few systems. Nevertheless, macroevolutionary studies consistently show that transitions to animal pollination are accompanied by an increase in diversification rate. Here we consider several models and diverse empirical data on how pollinators could influence speciation. We conclude that floral isolation is rarely, if ever, sufficient to cause speciation on its own, but that it acts synergistically with other isolating mechanisms.

Heat induced expression of the Hsp70 protein in adults decreases rates of age-specific mortality during normal aging, while maternally experienced heat shock depresses the production of mature progeny. Here we show that maternal heat shock reduces the proportion of egg hatch but not the viability of successfully hatched offspring. To assess whether heat induced maternal expression of hsp70 causes reduced egg hatch, we measured the proportion of eggs that hatch from females engineered to overexpress hsp70 transgenes. We used the same transgenic strains that extend longevity upon hsp70 expression and found that Hsp70 is sufficient to suppress egg hatch. The proportion of egg hatch as a function of hsp70 expression was not reduced in the first eggs laid after maternal heat shock, but appears in later laid eggs, which were at preoogenic and early vitellogenic stages during the maternal expression of hsp70. The contervailing effects of hsp70 upon fecundity and subsequent age-specific mortality exemplify antagonistic pleiotropy, and this trade-off could contribute to the evolution of Drosophila senescence.",86,2000,54,6,2038,2045"De Bello, F; Leps, J; Sebastia, MT",Predictive value of plant traits to grazing along a climatic gradient in the Mediterranean,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,Article,"1. In the face of large-scale environmental changes, predicting the consequences for species composition from species' traits can be a major step towards generalizing ecological patterns and management. Few studies, however, have explored the applicability of this tool in relation to different climatic conditions. Here, the changes in species composition along a gradient of sheep-grazing pressure (high, low, abandonment) were used to test whether a common set of plant functional traits (PFT) would provide consistent predictions of species' responses to grazing in different biogeographical regions. 2. Data were collected across an altitudinal and climatic gradient from Mediterranean rangelands to subalpine grasslands in north-eastern Spain. Species' responses were calculated using partial constrained ordination to account only for the effect of grazing intensity. Regression trees and general linear models were applied to identify traits that could predict species' responses. 3. Results were mostly consistent with the ruderal vs. competitive strategy (sensu Grime), in terms of life cycle, life form and plant height, and their expected responses to repeated disturbance. 4. However, the predictive capacity of the investigated traits changed with climatic conditions. Traits generally related to grazing did not show a strong repeatability across the climatic gradient. Convergent selection of climatic conditions and grazing indicated that plant features might reflect an adaptation to multiple selective forces. The climatic conditions acted as filters on the pool of PFT available and shifted the relevance of plant traits as potential predictors. Results were not substantially different after applying phylogenetically independent contrasts (PIC). 5. Synthesis and applications. At a local scale, plant functional traits are useful tools in predicting species' responses to grazing and, for conservation purposes, identifying species vulnerable to land-use changes. However, predictions cannot be extrapolated from one climatic region to another. The methodology proposed in this study to detect predicting traits can be applied more generally. Regression trees, in particular, appear to be a useful tool because they account for non-additive effects and allow visualizations of trait combinations.",84,2005,42,5,824,833"McClanahan, T; Polunin, N; Done, T",Ecological states and the resilience of coral reefs,CONSERVATION ECOLOGY,Review,"We review the evidence for multiple ecological states and the factors that create ecological resilience in coral reef ecosystems. There are natural differences among benthic communities along gradients of water temperature, light, nutrients, and organic matter associated with upwelling-downwelling and onshore-offshore systems. Along gradients from oligotrophy to eutrophy, plant-animal symbioses tend to decrease, and the abundance of algae and heterotrophic suspension feeders and the ratio of organic to inorganic carbon production tend to increase. Human influences such as fishing, increased organic matter and nutrients, sediments, warm water, and transportation of xenobiotics and diseases are common causes of a large number of recently reported ecological shifts. It is often the interaction of persistent and multiple synergistic disturbances that causes permanent ecological transitions, rather than the succession of individual short-term disturbances. For example, fishing can remove top-level predators, resulting in the ecological release of prey such as sea urchins and coral-eating invertebrates. When sea urchins are not common because of unsuitable habitat, recruitment limitations, and diseases, and when overfishing removes herbivorous fish, frondose brown algae can dominate. Terrigenous sediments carried onto reefs as a result of increased soil erosion largely promote the dominance of turf or articulated green algae. Elevated nutrients and organic matter can increase internal eroders of reef substratum and a mixture of filamentous algae. Local conservation actions that attempt to reduce fishing and terrestrial influences promote the high production of inorganic carbon that is necessary for reef growth. However, global climate change threatens to undermine such actions because of increased bleaching and mortality caused by warm-water anomalies, weakened coral skeletons caused by reduced aragonite availability in reef waters, and increased incidence of diseases in coral reef species. Consequently, many coral reefs, including those that are heavily managed, have experienced net losses in accumulated inorganic carbon in recent decades and appear likely to continue this trend in coming decades. Reefs urgently need to be managed with a view to strengthening their resilience to the increased frequency and intensity of these pressures.

To test this relationship and interactions among disturbances, we subjected wet prairie assemblages within 1.1 m(2) mesocosms to invasion by Phalaris and addition of nutrients, sediments, and flooding. Species richness decreased with the application of sediments and/or flooding of 4 consecutive weeks or longer. Losses of up to six dominant and subdominant species in these treatments increased light transmission through the plant canopy by as much as 400% over the control. Light availability in July and September was a strong predictor of end-of-season aboveground biomass of Phalaris. Phalaris was also 35% and 195% more productive when nutrients were added at low and high levels, respectively. Multiple factors in combination were usually additive in their effects on invasion, but sediments and nutrients interacted with flood regime to synergistically increase invasion in some cases.

Predation and parasitism are important factors in the ecology and evolution of natural populations and may, along with other environmental factors, interact with the impact of anthropogenic pollutants. 2. Our study aimed at identifying potential interactions between three stressors (predation threat, parasitism and pesticide exposure) and at exploring the predictability of their joint effects by using the model of independent action. We assessed in a full-factorial design the impacts of these stressors on key life-history traits and population growth rate of the water flea Daphnia magna. 3. When applied as single stressors, predation threat and parasite challenge induced varying stressor-specific adaptive responses. The pesticide carbaryl was applied at a generally sublethal concentration, which caused low mortality only in first-brood offspring. 4. Pesticide exposure interacted synergistically with parasite challenge regarding survival, which suggests immunomodulatory activity of the pesticide. Predation threat by phantom midge larvae showed antagonistic interactions for amount of first-brood offspring with both parasite challenge and carbaryl exposure. All stressors additively affected age and size at maturity, which added up to a considerable delay in the onset of reproduction in the three-stressor combination. The intrinsic rate of natural increase, r, reflected the non-additive and additive effects on single endpoints and showed significant synergistic interactions for all two-stressor combinations. The combination of all stressors resulted in a dramatic reduction of r compared to the stressor-free control. 5. The model of independent action proved useful in quantitatively predicting effects of additively acting stressors, and in visualizing the occurrence and magnitude of non-additive effects in accordance with results of analysis of variances. 6. Synthesis and applications. Cumulative additive effects and non-additive interactions of natural antagonists and pollutants are shown to result in considerable impacts on ecologically relevant parameters. As a starting point for an environmentally more realistic risk assessment of chemicals, it may be a valuable strategy to screen for non-additive effects among many stress factors simultaneously in simplified experimental designs by using the model of independent action.",82,2008,45,6,1820,1828"Agrawal, AA","Resistance and susceptibility of milkweed: Competition, root herbivory, and plant genetic variation",ECOLOGY,Article,"Beetles in the genus Tetraopes share a long evolutionary history with milkweeds (Asclepias spp.), feeding on roots as larvae and leaves as adults. Despite their extreme specialization on milkweed, Tetraopes require drying grass stems as oviposition sites, even though they do not consume grass. The natural history of the interaction suggests that herbivory may be likely only when milkweeds are in close proximity to grasses. Theory also predicts that two stresses on plants, competition and herbivory, may have non-additive negative impacts on correlates of fitness. In field experiments conducted over two years, I followed the consequences of grass competition and beetle attack for herbivory, growth, and reproduction of milkweed, and reciprocal effects of milkweed on grass in common gardens. To assess the effect of milkweed traits on beetles, I conducted a quantitative genetic experiment using full-sibling families of milkweed and measured the effects of putative resistance traits on the abundance of Tetraopes adults. Milkweeds growing next to grass were initially unaffected in growth but suffered 10% greater leaf herbivory by adult Tetraopes than did milkweeds growing alone. This effect was caused by direct attraction of beetles to grass, not by a competitive modification of milkweed's phenotype. In late summer of the first growing season, when Tetraopes naturally oviposits, I experimentally added larvae to milkweed roots with and without grass competition. Within a month, I detected an interaction between competition and herbivory: neither had an individual impact, but jointly they reduced milkweed growth. In spring of the second growing season, when Tetraopes had completed development, I again found strong evidence for a non-additive effect of competition and herbivory together, severely reducing plant growth compared to their individual effects. Root herbivory induced a plant response that reduced the abundance of leaf-mining flies by 40%, but only for milkweeds with grass competition. Neither competition nor herbivory affected the production of defensive latex, cardenolides, or carbon, but they interacted to affect leaf nitrogen content. Thus, although trait-mediated indirect interactions were implicated in the effect of competition and root herbivory on leaf miner abundance, I did not uncover the mechanism. In the final harvest, beetle herbivory reduced reproductive characters (fruit production, fruit mass, aboveground biomass) by 20-30%, whereas competition had negligible effects. The net interaction effect for grass was competitive, with a 23% reduction in grass biomass caused by milkweed in the absence of herbivory. However, the presence of beetle herbivory on milkweed roots completely alleviated the competitive effect of milkweed on grass. Thus, the associational effect of grass on milkweed resulted in milkweed suffering the non-additive effects of competition and herbivory, whereas grass enjoyed competitive release by facilitating its neighbor's herbivore. Many traits of milkweed (e.g., growth, reproduction, and several resistance traits) showed variation among 23 full-sibling families, indicating that competitive ability and resistance may be subject to natural selection. A multiple regression analysis on family means revealed that leaf trichome density and nitrogen content were negatively genetically correlated with abundance of Tetraopes adults, but probability of flowering and plant height were positively associated. Leaf miners were most strongly negatively affected by latex and trichomes. Thus, complex interactions among competition, root herbivory, and plant genetic variation affect the herbivore and plant community and may result in diffuse co-evolution between milkweed and its herbivores. I present a general model that predicts the conditions in which plant-plant interactions result in net competition or facilitation.",80,2004,85,8,2118,2133"LEATHWICK, JR",CLIMATIC RELATIONSHIPS OF SOME NEW-ZEALAND FOREST TREE SPECIES,JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE,Article,"A dataset of some 10 000 plots was used to describe the climatic relationships of 33 widespread New Zealand tree species. Estimates of mean annual temperature, temperature seasonality, mean annual solar radiation, and moisture balance were derived from mathematical surfaces fitted to climate station data. plots were also categorized into five lithological classes and three drainage classes. Generalized additive models were used to examine species/environment relationships. Mean annual temperature and mean annual solar radiation are most strongly correlated with current tree distributions, followed by moisture balance, temperature seasonality, lithology, and drainage. Most broad-leaved tree species other than Nothofagus spp. reach their greatest levels of occurrence in warm, moist environments with high solar radiation. In contrast, Nothofagus spp. generally reach their greatest levels of occurrence in cooler and/or lower insolation environments, and all have lower levels of occurrence on rhyolitic substrates which have resulted from large-scale geomorphic disturbance, mostly over the past few thousand years. Although coniferous species have widely differing climatic optima, many are biased towards lithological classes characterized either by large-scale geomorphic disturbance or harsh edaphic conditions. The relevance of these results to particular synecological questions is briefly discussed. Continuing adjustments in the range of slow-dispersing Nothofagus spp. are strongly suggested, and the climatic suitability of extensive rhyolitic basins in the central North Island, from which these species are largely absent, is confirmed.",80,1995,6,2,237,248"Chapman, BB; Bronmark, C; Nilsson, JA; Hansson, LA",The ecology and evolution of partial migration,OIKOS,Article,"Partial migration, where populations of animals are composed of a mixture of resident and migratory individuals, is a widespread phenomenon in nature. It has been reported to occur in all major vertebrate groups, and can have significant ecological consequences. Here we give an overview of the ecology and evolution of partial migration in animals. We firstly review the different types of partial migration, and assess the ecological drivers responsible for driving individual differences in migratory tendency within populations. A variety of factors can be important in promoting the evolution of partial migration, including competition for resources or breeding opportunities, predation risk and intraspecific niche diversity. Often various factors act synergistically to create complex patterns of movement polymorphism within populations. The question of how partial migration is maintained over evolutionary timescales is also addressed. Whilst many theoretical considerations of partial migration utilise an evolutionary stable state (ESS) paradigm, empirical evidence for this is lacking. Rather the evidence suggests that partial migration is mostly condition dependent, and the optimum outcome for an individual is dependent upon its phenotype. What determines whether an individual follows a migratory or resident strategy is discussed in light of new theory and empirical data which supports the idea that environmentally responsive genetic thresholds are important across a range of species, from birds to fish, in proximately shaping migratory tendency. Finally we espouse our vision of how partial migration research will develop in the future, and suggest a number of exciting directions that studies into migratory dimorphism may take in the coming years.",79,2011,120,12,1764,1775"Mantyka-Pringle, CS; Martin, TG; Rhodes, JR",Interactions between climate and habitat loss effects on biodiversity: a systematic review and meta-analysis,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Article,"Climate change and habitat loss are both key threatening processes driving the global loss in biodiversity. Yet little is known about their synergistic effects on biological populations due to the complexity underlying both processes. If the combined effects of habitat loss and climate change are greater than the effects of each threat individually, current conservation management strategies may be inefficient and at worst ineffective. Therefore, there is a pressing need to identify whether interacting effects between climate change and habitat loss exist and, if so, quantify the magnitude of their impact. In this article, we present a meta-analysis of studies that quantify the effect of habitat loss on biological populations and examine whether the magnitude of these effects depends on current climatic conditions and historical rates of climate change. We examined 1319 papers on habitat loss and fragmentation, identified from the past 20 years, representing a range of taxa, landscapes, land-uses, geographic locations and climatic conditions. We find that current climate and climate change are important factors determining the negative effects of habitat loss on species density and/or diversity. The most important determinant of habitat loss and fragmentation effects, averaged across species and geographic regions, was current maximum temperature, with mean precipitation change over the last 100 years of secondary importance. Habitat loss and fragmentation effects were greatest in areas with high maximum temperatures. Conversely, they were lowest in areas where average rainfall has increased over time. To our knowledge, this is the first study to conduct a global terrestrial analysis of existing data to quantify and test for interacting effects between current climate, climatic change and habitat loss on biological populations.

Agricultural intensification reduces ecological resilience of land-use systems, whereas paradoxically, environmental change and climate extremes require a higher response capacity than ever. Adaptation strategies to environmental change include maintenance of shade trees in tropical agroforestry, but conversion of shaded to unshaded systems is common practice to increase short-term yield. 2. In this paper, we review the short-term and long-term ecological benefits of shade trees in coffee Coffea arabica, C. canephora and cacao Theobroma cacao agroforestry and emphasize the poorly understood, multifunctional role of shade trees for farmers and conservation alike. 3. Both coffee and cacao are tropical understorey plants. Shade trees in agroforestry enhance functional biodiversity, carbon sequestration, soil fertility, drought resistance as well as weed and biological pest control. However, shade is needed for young cacao trees only and is less important in older cacao plantations. This changing response to shade regime with cacao plantation age often results in a transient role for shade and associated biodiversity in agroforestry. 4. Abandonment of old, unshaded cacao in favour of planting young cacao in new, thinned forest sites can be named 'short-term cacao boom-and-bust cycle', which counteracts tropical forest conservation. In a 'long-term cacao boom-and-bust cycle', cacao boom can be followed by cacao bust due to unmanageable pest and pathogen levels (e.g. in Brazil and Malaysia). Higher pest densities can result from physiological stress in unshaded cacao and from the larger cacao area planted. Risk-averse farmers avoid long-term vulnerability of their agroforestry systems by keeping shade as an insurance against insect pest outbreaks, whereas yield-maximizing farmers reduce shade and aim at short-term monetary benefits. 5. Synthesis and applications. Sustainable agroforestry management needs to conserve or create a diverse layer of multi-purpose shade trees that can be pruned rather than removed when crops mature. Incentives from payment-for-ecosystem services and certification schemes encourage farmers to keep high to medium shade tree cover. Reducing pesticide spraying protects functional agrobiodiversity such as antagonists of pests and diseases, pollinating midges determining cacao yields and pollinating bees enhancing coffee yield. In a landscape perspective, natural forest alongside agroforestry allows noncrop-crop spillover of a diversity of functionally important organisms. Knowledge transfer between farmers, agronomists and ecologists in a participatory approach helps to encourage a shade management regime that balances economic and ecological needs and provides a 'diversified food-and-cash crop' livelihood strategy.",78,2011,48,3,619,629"Caujape-Castells, J; Tye, A; Crawford, DJ; Santos-Guerra, A; Sakai, A; Beaver, K; Lobin, W; Florens, FBV; Moura, M; Jardim, R; Gomes, I; Kueffer, C",Conservation of oceanic island floras: Present and future global challenges,PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS,Review,"Current threats to the planet's biodiversity are unprecedented,.and they particularly imperil insular floras. In this investigation, we use the threat factors identified by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment as the main drivers of biodiversity loss on islands to define and rank 13 current, continuing threats to the plant diversity of nine focal archipelagos where volcanic origin (or in the Seychelles a prolonged isolation after a continental origin) has produced a high degree of endemicity and fragility in the face of habitat alteration. We also conduct a global endangerment assessment based on the numbers of insular endemic plants in the endangered (EN) and critically endangered (CR) IUCN categories for 53 island groups with an estimated 9951 endemic plant species, providing a representative sample of the world's insular systems and their floristic richness. Our analyses indicate that isolation does not significantly influence endangerment, but plant endemics from very small islands are more often critically endangered. We estimate that between 3500 and 6800 of the estimated 70,000 insular endemic plant species worldwide might be highly threatened (CR+EN) and between ca. 2000 and 2800 of them in critical danger of extinction (CR). Based on these analyses, and on a worldwide literature review of the biological threat factors considered, we identify challenging questions for conservation research, asking (i) what are the most urgent priorities for the conservation of insular species and floras, and (ii) with the knowledge and assets available, how can we improve the impact of conservation science and practice on the preservation of island biodiversity? Our analysis indicates that the synergistic action of many threat factors can induce major ecological disturbances, leading to multiple extinctions. We review weaknesses and strengths in conservation research and management in the nine focal archipelagos, and highlight the urgent need for conservation scientists to share knowledge and expertise, identify and discuss common challenges, and formulate multi-disciplinary conservation objectives for insular plant endemics worldwide.

Recent evidence indicates that some juvenile flatfishes associate with emergent structures such as sponge, shell and other biogenic and bed-form features of otherwise low-relief shelf habitats. In laboratory experiments we examined the habitat preference and effects of habitat structure upon predation vulnerability of sub-yearling (Age-0) Pacific halibut Hippoglossus stenolepis and northern rock sole Lepidopsetta polyxystra. When given the choice between bare sand or sand with 16% sponge coverage, halibut demonstrated strong preference for sponge, while rock sole showed no preference. Larger Age-2 halibut (used as predators in the subsequent experiment) also preferred sponge, but this preference declined with increasing hunger. When allowed to forage for Age-0 flatfishes in either bare sand or sponge, predators consumed more prey in sand and consumed more Age-0 halibut than rock sole. We were able to determine which behavioral processes in the predator-prey interaction were modified by the presence of habitat structure. Predator-prey encounter rates decreased in the sponge habitat as predator search was impeded: predators paused more frequently and swam more slowly to maneuver through the sponges. Sponges also tended to hinder the pursuit of prey. Rock sole utilized stereotypic flatfish defense-mechanisms, relying upon immobility, burial and crypsis, and were less likely to flush at a predator's approach than halibut. Halibut have a less developed ability to mimic sediments, but a deeper/narrower body that confers greater swimming speed, and were more likely to flush as a predator approached. Once they had flushed and were pursued by a predator, halibut were more likely to escape than were rock sole. These experiments support an accumulating body of evidence that emergent structure, in otherwise low-relief benthic habitats, may play an important role in the ecology of some juvenile flatfishes. Removal of emergent structure by towed fishing gear and other anthropogenic and/or natural disturbance may influence patterns of distribution for juvenile halibut, as fish redistribute to less preferred habitat, and may decrease survival rates through increased losses to predation.",72,2004,268,,231,243"Wernberg, T; Russell, BD; Moore, PJ; Ling, SD; Smale, DA; Campbell, A; Coleman, MA; Steinberg, PD; Kendrick, GA; Connell, SD",Impacts of climate change in a global hotspot for temperate marine biodiversity and ocean warming,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,Article,"Temperate Australia is a global hotspot for marine biodiversity and its waters have experienced well-above global average rates of ocean warming. We review the observed impacts of climate change (e.g. warming, ocean acidification, changes in storm patterns) on subtidal temperate coasts in Australia and assess how these systems are likely to respond to further change. Observed impacts are region specific with the greatest number of species responses attributable to climate change reported in south-eastern Australia, where recent ocean warming has been most pronounced. Here, a decline of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) and poleward range extension of a key herbivore (sea urchin) and other trophically important reef organisms has occurred. Although, evidence of changes on other coastlines around Australia is limited, we suggest that this is due to a lack of data rather than lack of change. Because of the east-west orientation of the south coast, most of Australia's temperate waters are found within a narrow latitudinal band, where any southward movement of isotherms is likely to affect species across very large areas. Future increases in temperature are likely to result in further range shifts of macroalgae and associated species, with range contractions and local extinctions to be expected for species that have their northern limits along the southern coastline. While there is currently no evidence of changes attributable to non-temperature related climate impacts, potentially due to a lack of long-term observational data, experimental evidence suggests that ocean acidification will result in negative effects on calcifying algae and animals. More importantly, recent experiments suggest the combined effects of climate change and non-climate stressors (overharvesting, reduced water quality) will lower the resilience of temperate marine communities to perturbations (e.g. storms, diseases, and introduced species), many of which are also predicted to increase in frequency and/or severity. Thus climate change is likely to, both by itself and in synergy with other stressors, impose change to southern Australian coastal species, including important habitat-forming algae and the associated ecological functioning of temperate coasts. Management of local and regional-scale stresses may increase the resistance of temperate marine communities to climate stressors and as such, provides an attractive tool for building resilience in temperate systems.

This growth/predation risk trade-off apparently allows these taxa to coexist in ponds and lakes across the Holarctic. However, laboratory studies presented here show that the mechanism assumed by most theoretical and empirical studies to mediate this trade-off, namely activity simultaneously modulating foraging returns and predation risk, does not operate in this system. Ischnura verticalis larvae were more active than larvae of Enallagma species in a short-term behavioral experiment, which explains why Ischnura experiences greater mortality from predation. However, this greater activity did not translate into higher feeding rates. Ischnura verticalis and Enallagma species ate comparable amounts of food in both the short-term behavioral experiment and a longer feeding and digestion experiment. In spite of no difference in the amount of food ingested or assimilated, I. verticalis larvae grew faster than Enallagma larvae because they were better able to physiologically convert assimilated food into their own biomass in the presence of mortality threats.

In the present study with the weedy annual plant Sinapis arvensis, we (a) tested for the adaptive value of phenotypic plasticity in morphological and life history traits in response to low light and (b) explored possible fitness costs of plasticity. Replicates of 31 half-sib families were grown individually in the greenhouse under full light and under low light (40% of ambient) imposed by neutral shade cloth. Low light resulted in a large increase in hypocotyl length and specific leaf area (SLA), a reduction in juvenile biomass and a delayed onset of flowering. Phenotypic selection analysis within each light environment revealed that selection favoured large SLA under low light, but not under high light, suggesting that the observed increase in SLA was adaptive. In contrast, plasticity in the other traits measured was maladaptive (i.e. in the opposite direction to that favoured by selection in the low light environment). We detected significant additive genetic variance in plasticity in most phenotypic traits and in fitness (number of seeds). Using genotypic selection gradient analysis, we found that families with high plasticity in SLA had a lower fitness than families with low plasticity, when the effect of SLA on fitness was statistically kept constant. This indicates that plasticity in SLA incurred a direct fitness cost. However, a cost of plasticity was only expressed under low light, but not under high light. Thus, models on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity will need to incorporate plasticity costs that vary in magnitude depending on environmental conditions.",71,2003,16,2,313,323"Hartig, EK; Gornitz, V; Kolker, A; Mushacke, F; Fallon, D","Anthropogenic and climate-change impacts on salt marshes of Jamaica Bay, New York City",WETLANDS,Article,"Field studies and aerial photograph interpretation suggest that large sections of Jamaica Bay salt marshes in New York City near John F.

Possible factors include reduced sediment input, dredging for navigation channels, boat traffic, and regional sea-level rise. Field work included aboveground biomass measurements of Spartina alterniflora, mapping plant community distribution, and documenting biogeomorphological indicators of marsh loss. Current productivity (standing crop biomass), which ranged from approximately 700 to 1500 g m(-2), was typical of healthy marshes in this region, in spite of other indicators of marsh degradation.

Overall island low marsh vegetation losses since 1974 averaged 38%, with smaller islands losing up to 78% of their vegetation cover. Ground observations indicate that major mechanisms of marsh loss include increased ponding within marsh interiors, slumping along marsh edges, and widening of tidal inlets.

However, little is known about the effects of sulfide on Thalassia testudinum, a dominant tropical seagrass, or other seagrass species. It has been hypothesized that high sulfide exposure is a major contributor to T. testudinum ""die-back"" in the large subtropical lagoon of South Florida, Florida Bay. Three experiments were conducted to pursue the mechanism by which T. testudinum was resilient to sulfide exposure in our previous experiment and to investigate the levels of sulfide that cause T. testudinum mortality. Two low-light (similar to 150 mu mol PAR m(-2) s(-1)) experiments were conducted to evaluate the role of light and photosynthesis on sulfide toxicity. Secondly, we tested the effects of high salinity (HS) and high temperature (HT) on sulfide tolerance to determine if these interactions could synergistically create a ""die-back"" response. Leaf elongation rates were not significantly affected by below-ground sulfide exposure in the range of 1-10 mM when incubated at subsaturating light and ambient sediment pH (7.0). Leaf O-2 production rates were also unaffected by sulfide exposure. In fact, all plants post-treatment possessed rhizome-extractable O-2 concentrations greater than 30%. When sulfide treatments (6 mM) were combined with HS and HT treatments, however, we observed our first ""die-back"" response. Shoots exposed to 6.0 mM sulfide under HS and HT had 50% and 33% mortality rates, and those in the HT + HS treatment had 100% mortality. Interestingly, no mortality was seen in the HS or HT treatments without sulfides added. The first two experiments in this study and our previous experiment clearly suggest that T. testudinum may be tolerant to short-term ( < 28 days) below-ground tissue exposure to high sulfide concentrations. An important caveat appears to be, however, when sulfide exposure is combined with other stressors common in Florida Bay and other tropical/subtropical lagoons and estuaries. These results point to the importance of examining multiple interactive stressors when elucidating the factors causing ""die-back"" in seagrasses. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

We investigated the individual and combined effects of the principal stressors (nutrient concentration and streambed fine sediment cover) operating in native grassland streams converted to pasture in New Zealand, using two different approaches: a survey of 32 small streams and an experiment involving nine streams where the stressors were manipulated in a factorial design. We investigated the consequences for populations of benthic invertebrates and for the structure of communities, including taxon richness and the representation of species traits. 3. Up to half the taxa and most community metrics responded to at least one stressor. Our results suggest that in these streams, an increase in fine sediment loading from anthropogenic causes had more widespread effects than augmented nutrient concentrations. Of most significance is our finding, both from the survey and, in particular, the experiment, of a variety of complex interactions among the stressors. 4. Synthesis and applications. The development of indices of stream health that distinguish the effects of sediment from those of nutrients should help prioritize catchment management actions. Of more general importance is our finding that the consequences of stressors are often unpredictable on the basis of knowledge of single effects; if managers only consider the effects of individual stressors, their assessment of risk may be higher or lower than reality.",67,2008,45,6,1810,1819"GRANT, PR; GRANT, BR",DEMOGRAPHY AND THE GENETICALLY EFFECTIVE SIZES OF 2 POPULATIONS OF DARWIN FINCHES,ECOLOGY,Article,"The purpose of this study was to identify and quantify the demographic and genetic factors that favor long-term persistence of resident bird populations on small islands. Two species of Darwin's Ground Finches, Geospiza scandens (Cactus Finch) and G. fortis (Medium Ground Finch), were studied on Isla Daphne Major, Galapagos, from 1975 to 1991. Four cohorts born in the years 1975-1978 were followed to the point where almost every individual had died. Life tables were constructed from survival and reproductive data, and used to calculate genetically effective population sizes. Annual rainfall was highly variable and erratic. Extremes were 0 and 1359 mm. As a consequence the finch populations fluctuated in all demographic parameters. In years of little or no rainfall breeding did not occur, in years of abundant rainfall as many as eight breeding attempts were made by individual pairs. Maximum ages were 15 yr for G. scandens and 14 yr for G. fortis. Males of both species tended to live longer than females and to breed later; most females bred for the first time at ages 1-3 yr, whereas most males bred for the first time at ages 2-6 yr. An unusual feature of the survival and reproductive schedules is an increase in reproductive value sometimes occurring moderately late in life more than once, associated with occasional extremely favorable conditions for reproduction. Harmonic mean breeding population sizes (NBAR) were 94 G. scandens and 197 G. fortis. Effective population sizes (N(e)) were much lower, principally as a result of a large variance in the production of recruits per parent, especially by G. fortis. Average effective sizes were 38 G. scandens and 60 G. fortis by one method of calculation, and slightly larger by another. The proportional rate of loss of selectively neutral heterozygosity or additive genetic variance in quantitative traits potentially caused by random genetic drift (1/2N(e)) in these populations is approximately 0.003-0.005, or 0.3-0.5%/yr, and between 0.8 and 1.4% per generation. We suggest that a general estimate for the effective size of terrestrial bird populations is about one-quarter of average breeding numbers. These results are discussed in relation to the long-term viability of the populations and the maintenance of genetic variation. The demographic features that enable the finch species to persist in the face of extreme environmental stochasticity are a high maximum life-span, a generally high adult survival under the stressful conditions of drought, a flexible period of maturity, and a high reproductive rate. Despite their relatively small effective population sizes and the likelihood of genetic impoverishment through random drift they remain genetically variable through gene flow, principally hybridization. This study highlights fluctuating (unstable) age structures as a methodological constraint on some of the theoretical calculations. An expanded demographic and population-genetic theory is needed to overcome this constraint.",67,1992,73,3,766,784"Thackeray, SJ; Jones, ID; Maberly, SC",Long-term change in the phenology of spring phytoplankton: species-specific responses to nutrient enrichment and climatic change,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Article,"1. A number of studies have shown that spring biological events have advanced in recent decades, and concluded that these changes in phenology are driven by climatic change. Freshwater lakes are sensitive indicators of climate change, where direct effects of climate on physical processes can affect the seasonal timing of planktonic communities. However, many lake ecosystems have also experienced long-term changes in other ecological pressures that could affect phenology. 2. In this study, long-term (1955-2003) physical, chemical and biological data from Windermere (UK) were analysed in order to assess the relative effects of a number of coincident pressures on the phenology of two spring diatom taxa. The analysis provides a detailed case study, highlighting the species-specific drivers that affect the phenology of dominant members of the phytoplankton community. 3. The results showed that, whilst the spring peak biomass of one taxon (Cyclotella) appeared to be advancing as a result of earlier thermal stratification, the advancement of the other (Asterionella) was closely linked with both progressive nutrient enrichment and lake warming. Furthermore, nutrient enrichment explained more variation in phenology than water temperature. Both taxa also reached their peak abundance earlier when the over wintering biomass at the end of the previous year was higher. 4. Patterns of change in phenology and ecological pressures were markedly nonlinear in time, as were the effects of some drivers of seasonal timing. This highlighted a need to relax the restriction of linearity in our analyses of biological seasonality. 5. Synthesis. Phenological shifts may be brought about by local processes, such as eutrophication, as well as by climate change. Even in the same ecosystem different mechanisms may alter the phenology of different species.",66,2008,96,3,523,535"Przeslawski, R; Davis, AR; Benkendorff, K",Synergistic effects associated with climate change and the development of rocky shore molluscs,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Article,"Global climate change and ozone layer thinning will simultaneously expose organisms to increasingly stressful conditions.

We detected synergistic effects with increases in mortality and retardation in development associated with the most physiologically stressful conditions. The effects of UVR were particularly marked, with mortality increasing up to 12-fold under stressful conditions.

Yet seed dispersal interacts decisively with the major drivers of biodiversity change in the 21st century: habitat fragmentation, overharvesting, biological invasions, and climate change. We synthesize current knowledge of the effects these drivers have on seed dispersal to identify research gaps and to show how this information can be used to improve conservation management. The drivers, either individually, or in combination, have changed the quantity, species composition, and spatial pattern of dispersed seeds in the majority of ecosystems worldwide, with inevitable consequences for species survival in a rapidly changing world. The natural history of seed dispersal is now well-understood in a range of landscapes worldwide. Only a few generalizations that have emerged are directly applicable to conservation management, however, because they are frequently confounded by site-specific and species-specific variation. Potentially synergistic interactions between disturbances are likely to exacerbate the negative impacts, but these are rarely investigated. We recommend that the conservation status of functionally unique dispersers be revised and that the conservation target for key seed dispersers should be a population size that maintains their ecological function, rather than merely the minimum viable population. Based on our analysis of conservation needs, seed dispersal research should be carried out at larger spatial scales in heterogenous landscapes, examining the simultaneous impacts of multiple drivers on community-wide seed dispersal networks.

Standard resource-competition models from this theory predict that the number of coexisting species should not exceed the number of factors that limit population growth. Here I show that positive interactions among resource competitors can produce species-rich model communities supported by a single limiting resource. Simulations show that when resource competitors reduce each others' per capita mortality rate (e.g. by ameliorating an abiotic stress), stable multispecies coexistence with a single resource may be common, even while the net interspecific interaction remains negative. These results demonstrate that positive interactions may provide an important mechanism for generating species-rich communities in nature. They also show that focusing on the net interaction between species may conceal important coexistence mechanisms when species simultaneously engage in both antagonistic and positive interactions.",65,2008,11,9,929,936"Svensson, E; Sinervo, B; Comendant, T","Condition, genotype-by-environment interaction, and correlational selection in lizard life-history morphs",EVOLUTION,Review,"We compared reproductive allocation and variation in condition and survivorship of two heritable female throat color morphs (orange and yellow) in a free-living population of side-blotched lizards (Uta stansburiana). Using path analysis and structural equation modeling, we investigated how variation in the social environment affected clutch size and egg mass and two condition traits (postlaying mass, immunological condition) and how these traits in turn affected female field survival. In the presence of many neighbors, both morphs increased their clutch sizes, although these effects were only significant in yellow females. In addition, yellow females increased their egg mass in the presence of many orange neighbors. Orange females surrounded by many orange neighbors showed sign of stress in the form of immunosuppression, whereas this effect was less pronounced in yellow females. The morphs also differed in the impact of variation in clutch size and egg mass on both condition traits. Finally, female morphotype and immune responsiveness affected fitness interactively, and hence these two traits showed signs of fitness epistasis: Selection gradients on this trait were opposite in sign in the two morphs. The correlational selection gradient (gamma (throatxantibody) (response)) between female throat color and antibody responsiveness was -0.365.

Diversity is maintained within the community by speciation. Hubbell's model makes predictions about the distribution of species abundances within communities and the turnover of species from place to place (beta diversity). However, ecological drift cannot be tested adequately against these predictions without independent estimates of speciation rates, population sizes, and dispersal distances. A more practical prediction from ecological drift is that time to extinction of a population of size N is approximately 2N generations. I test this prediction here using data for passerine birds (Passeriformes). Waiting times to speciation and extinction were estimated from genetic divergence between sister populations and a lineage-through-time plot for endemic South American suboscine passerines. Population sizes were estimated from local counts of birds in two large forest plots extrapolated to the area of wet tropical forest in South America and from atlas data on European passerines. Waiting times to extinction (ca. 2 Ma) are much less than twice the product of average population size (4.0 and 14.4 x 10(6) individuals in South America and Europe) and generation length (five and three years) for songbirds, that is, 40 and 86 Ma, respectively. Thus, drift is too slow to account for turnover in regional avifaunas. Presumably, other processes, involving external drivers, such as climate and physiographic change, and internal drivers, such as evolutionary change in antagonistic interactions, predominate. Hubbell's model is historical and geographic, and his perspective importantly links local and regional process and pattern.

Semi-natural habitats have been shaped by human disturbance regimes for centuries. Spatially and temporally heterogeneous land-use practices, such as cutting, burning, grazing and turf-cutting, have resulted in complex mosaic landscapes that are of high priority for conservation in Europe. Contemporary conservation subjects these systems to management regimes that are generally less diverse, in terms of disturbances and fine-scale temporal and spatial variability, than traditional land use, but the ecological consequences of these simplifications are unclear. 2. We investigated the interactive effects of fire and grazing on plant species composition and diversity along local environmental (moisture) gradients in coastal heathlands. A replicated series of post-fire successions (n = 12) was initiated in three heathland habitats and the areas subjected to two grazing regimes. Floristic and environmental data were recorded in permanent plots over a 5-year period. Community data were analysed using multivariate ordination techniques (principal components analysis, partial redundancy analyses, and principal response curves) and generalized linear models. 3. Fire induced strong successional trends in the species composition of the heathlands. These trends differed among heathland habitats, and with grazing. Strong interactions between fire, habitat and grazing implied that the effect of grazing on the successional dynamics differed among habitats. Species diversity decreased in the first year after fire but increased beyond the pre-fire levels during succession. This trend was not affected by local environment or grazing, although there were main effect differences in diversity between environments and grazing regimes. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate that the two management practices do not have simple additive effects within the semi-natural system studied, as grazing created ecological opportunities for additional sets of species, increased variability among habitats, and added complexity to the post-fire successional dynamics. In order to preserve diversity, conservation management should thus aim to preserve the level of complexity of the traditional management regimes, both in terms of the actual disturbances (e.g. fire and grazing) as well as the spatial scales at which they are applied. Further, the considerable change in these effects along the local environmental gradient brings into question the efficiency of general management prescriptions, and indicates that local environmental variability should be taken into account in the conservation of semi-natural habitats.",64,2005,42,1,139,149"Mitchell, KA; Hoffmann, AA",Thermal ramping rate influences evolutionary potential and species differences for upper thermal limits in Drosophila,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,Article,"P>1. Thermal tolerance is a key factor limiting insect distributions, but there is limited information on the ability of species to evolve different thermal limits. Recent studies indicate that the experimental protocol influences upper limits, with slower but ecologically relevant rates of warming lowering estimates of tolerance. These effects could also influence genetic and environmental variances that define evolutionary potential. 2. To determine the influence of experimental protocol on estimates of narrow sense heritability (h2(n)) and other measures of evolutionary potential in Drosophila melanogaster, we conducted family studies on knockdown time when flies were immediately exposed to a high temperature (static) or when temperature was increased to an upper limit (ramping). 3. Estimates of variance components in two populations were obtained using the animal model approach that incorporates information from all relationships among relatives. Coefficients of variation were higher when flies were exposed to a static stress, as were estimates of additive genetic variance and measures of evolvability where genetic variances were standardized by trait means. In contrast, levels of environmental variance were higher under ramping conditions. These effects mean that the narrow sense heritability of thermal resistance was low under slow ramping and did not differ significantly from zero. 4. Differences in thermal limits under both methods were detected among Drosophila species. There was a significant positive relationship between the fast and slow ramping estimates of thermal resistance across species after correction for phylogeny, suggesting similar underlying mechanisms or a history of correlated evolution. However, this result was caused by the strong influence of two taxa. 5. These results suggest that natural populations exhibit lower adaptive potential for upper thermal limits under ramping than estimated from traditional (static) estimates of heat resistance. Even the highly adaptable Drosophila melanogaster appears to have little evolutionary potential to extend its upper thermal range under ramping conditions although species have diverged for this measure.",63,2010,24,3,694,700"van Oers, K; Drent, PJ; de Jong, G; van Noordwijk, AJ",Additive and nonadditive genetic variation in avian personality traits,HEREDITY,Article,"Individuals of all vertebrate species differ consistently in their reactions to mildly stressful challenges.

Based on presence-absence data we examined the shape of plant species responses (measured as probability of occurrence) along three climatic gradients across latitudes in Europe (1577 species) and altitudes in the Swiss Alps (284 species) using Huisman-Olff-Fresco, generalized linear and generalized additive models. Results We found that almost half of the species from Europe and one-third from the Swiss Alps showed responses consistent with the predictions of the AASL hypothesis.

It is of particular importance to understand how changes in herbivore population density, especially of elephants, and fire frequency will affect the amount of tree cover in savanna ecosystems, given the critical importance of tree cover for biodiversity, ecosystem function, and human welfare. We developed a spatially realistic simulation model of vegetation,fire, and dominant herbivore dynamics, tailored to the Serengeti ecosystem of east Africa. The model includes key processes such as tree-grass competition, fire, and resource-based density dependence and adaptive movement by herbivores. We used the model to project the ecosystem 100 years into the future from its present state under different fire, browsing (determined by elephant population density), and grazing (with and without wildebeest present) regimes. The model produced the following key results: (1) elephants and fire exert synergistic negative effects on woody cover; when grazers are excluded, the impact of fire and the strength of the elephant-fire interaction increase; (2) at present population densities of 0.15 elephants/km(2), the total amount of woody cover is predicted to remain stable in the absence of fire, but the mature tree population is predicted to decline regardless of the fire regime; without grazers present to mitigate the effects of fire, the size structure of the tree population will become dominated by seedlings and mature trees; (3) spatial heterogeneity in tree cover varies unimodally with elephant population density fire increases heterogeneity in the presence of grazers and decreases it in their absence; (4) the marked rainfall gradient in the Serengeti directly affects the pattern of tree cover in the absence of fire; with fire, the woody cover is determined by the grazing patterns of the migratory wildebeest, which are partly rainfall driven.

As both factors directly affected larval period and thus metamorphic success, we performed a factorial field experiment to examine the response of developmental rates to drought regime and its interaction with population density, by controlling pond duration, larval density and food level. Timing of metamorphosis was affected by larval density and food level. However, the response among larvae due to pond duration was not additive. At low larval density, tadpoles raised in short duration ponds exhibited shorter larval periods than in long duration ponds. In constrast, plasticity in developmental rates due to pond duration was less marked at high larval densities and no difference in length of larval period was found. This may be the result of higher competition levels in short duration ponds through an increase in actual larval density because of decreasing water level and lower metamorphic rates. This higher competitive stress was also evident by smaller metamorphic size in short ponds. At low densities tadpoles in longer duration ponds exhibited no additional growth, indicating that tadpoles that remained for a longer period did not achieve larger metamorphic size.

The ability of encrusting corallines to monopolize and retain space without overgrowth depended on the presence of shade (positive effect) if sediment deposition was below that observed on coast characterized by high rates of sedimentation (negative effect). In contrast, the growth and persistence of articulated corallines depended on the absence of shade (negative effect) and high levels of sediment accumulation observed on human-dominated coast (positive effect). The recruitment of filamentous-turfs was facilitated by full light, but was not strongly affected by sedimentation. Instead, filamentous - turfs tolerated heavy sediment accumulation, a factor thought to explain the concomitant increase in spatial dominance of algal-turfs and loss of canopy-forming algae on reefs with heavy sedimentation. Importantly, different habitats will assemble or be maintained to match the environmental conditions in which they are most extensive, demonstrating the key role of physical factors associated with habitat-formers (kelp forests) and human-dominated coast (heavy sedimentation).

Even though pesticides are unique chemical stressors designed to have biological activity that can affect a number of nontarget species, they are intentionally placed into the environment in large quantities. Currently, methods and terminology for evaluating mixture toxicity are poorly established. The most common approach used is the assumption of additive concentration, with the concentrations adjusted for potency to a reference toxicant. Using this approach, the joint action of pesticides that have similar chemical structures and modes of toxic action can be predicted. However, this approach and other modeling techniques often provide little insight into the observed toxicity produced by mixtures of pesticides from different classes. Particularly difficult to model are mixtures that involve a secondary toxicant that changes the toxicokinetics of a primary toxicant. This may result in increased activation or a change in the persistence of the primary toxicant within the organism and may be responsible for a several-fold increase or decrease in toxicity. At present, the ecological effects caused by mixtures of pesticides are given little consideration in the regulatory process. However, mixtures are being considered in relation to human health in the pesticide registration process, setting a precedent that could be followed for ecological protection. Additionally, pesticide mixtures may be regulated through toxicity testing of surface water under the Clean Water Act. The limits of our basic knowledge of how mixtures interact are compromising both these avenues for regulating mixtures. We face many challenges to adequately protecting the environment from mixture toxicity; these challenges include understanding the interactions of toxicants within an organism, identifying the mixtures that most commonly occur and cause adverse effects, and developing a regulatory structure capable of minimizing environmental impacts.",61,2004,9,6,,"Imasheva, AG; Bosenko, DV; Bubli, OA",Variation in morphological traits of Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) under nutritional stress,HEREDITY,Article,"The effect of nutritional stress on phenotypical and genetic variation was examined for five morphological traits (thorax length, wing length, sternopleural chaeta number, abdominal chaeta number and arista branch number) in 30 isofemale lines of Drosophila melanogaster.

We propose, as an answer, that more religions have emerged and are maintained in the tropics because, through localized coevolutionary races with hosts, infectious diseases select for three anticontagion behaviours: in-group assortative sociality; out-group avoidance; and limited dispersal. These behaviours, in turn, create intergroup boundaries that effectively fractionate, isolate and diversify an original culture leading to the genesis of two or more groups from one. Religion is one aspect of a group's culture that undergoes this process. If this argument is correct then, across the globe, religion diversity should correlate positively with infectious disease diversity, reflecting an evolutionary history of antagonistic coevolution between parasites and hosts and subsequent religion genesis. We present evidence that supports this model: for a global sample of traditional societies, societal range size is reduced in areas with more pathogens compared with areas with few pathogens, and in contemporary countries religion diversity is positively related to two measures of parasite stress.",59,2008,275,1651,2587,2594"Lees, AC; Peres, CA",Rapid avifaunal collapse along the Amazonian deforestation frontier,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,Article,"The combined effects of rapid habitat loss, fragmentation and disturbance on tropical forest avifaunas have not been examined to date. The southern Amazonian 'arc of deforestation' marks the boundary of the most aggressive agricultural frontier in tropical forests worldwide.

A number of forest patch metrics, derived from an independent remote sensing approach, explained much of the resulting presence/absence matrix. The bird community exhibited a highly nested structure, with small patches being most dissimilar from one another. Bird species differed in their response to both forest patch size and forest canopy perforation according to their dependence on closed-canopy primary forest. Forest patch geometry, which clearly modulated the shape of species-area relationships accounted for 83-96% of the variation in species richness, but forest habitat quality resulting from logging and surface-fire disturbance was also a significant predictor of species richness for the most forest-dependent taxa.

Two important issues are whether stress and inbreeding effects are independent as opposed to synergistic, and whether inbreeding effects are general across stresses as opposed to stress-specific. We found that inbreeding reduced resistance to acetone and desiccation in adult Drosophila melanogaster, whereas resistance to knockdown heat stress was not affected. Inbred flies, however, experienced a greater proportional decrease in productivity than outbreds following heat stress. Correlations using line means indicated that all resistance traits were uncorrelated in the inbred as well as in the outbred flies.

We consider the effects of this key driver of both local and global change on both mutualistic and antagonistic systems at different levels of biological organisation and spatiotemporal scales. There is a complex interplay of patterns and processes related to the variation and influence of spatial, temporal and biotic drivers in ecological networks. Species traits (e.g. body size, dispersal ability) play an important role in determining how networks respond to fragment size and isolation, edge shape and permeability, and the quality of the surrounding landscape matrix. Furthermore, the perception of spatial scale (e.g. environmental grain) and temporal effects (time lags, extinction debts) can differ markedly among species, network modules and trophic levels, highlighting the need to develop a more integrated perspective that considers not just nodes, but the structural role and strength of species interactions (e.g. as hubs, spatial couplers and determinants of connectance, nestedness and modularity) in response to habitat fragmentation. Many challenges remain for improving our understanding: the likely importance of specialisation, functional redundancy and trait matching has been largely overlooked. The potentially critical effects of apex consumers, abundant species and supergeneralists on network changes and evolutionary dynamics also need to be addressed in future research. Ultimately, spatial and ecological networks need to be combined to explore the effects of dispersal, colonisation, extinction and habitat fragmentation on network structure and coevolutionary dynamics.

We developed a novel predictive framework of species extinction vulnerability and applied it to coral reef fishes. Although relatively few coral reef fishes are at risk of global extinction from climate disturbances, a negative convex relationship between fish species locally vulnerable to climate change vs. fisheries exploitation indicates that the entire community is vulnerable on the many reefs where both stressors co-occur.

A study of prolactin in black-legged kittiwakes,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,Article,"P>An emergency life-history stage is expressed in breeding vertebrates when the immediate survival is threatened by poor energetic conditions (i.e. allostatic overload). This emergency life-history stage shifts energy investment away from reproduction and redirects it toward immediate survival. In birds, this emergency life-history stage is promoted by a release of the stress hormone corticosterone. However, how corticosterone reduces the expression of parental cares remains to be clarified. One hypothesis is that the release of corticosterone may also affect prolactin levels, a pituitary hormone widely involved in regulating parental behaviours. We tested this hypothesis by experimentally increasing corticosterone levels of chick-rearing black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) over a 2-day period and by monitoring prolactin levels over an 8-day period. We also investigated whether this hormonal manipulation affected nest attendance, the motivation to come back to the nest after a short-term stress and breeding success. Corticosterone treatment resulted in a significant increase in plasma corticosterone levels during the first 2 days, which returned to pre-treatment values at day 3. This short-term corticosterone increase was accompanied by a 30% decrease in prolactin levels. Prolactin levels were reduced in a progressive and persistent manner and did not return to their initial levels when corticosterone levels returned to pre-treatment levels. Moreover, although corticosterone levels had returned to pre-treatment values, low prolactin levels were associated with a reduced nest attendance and a greater latency to come back to the nest after a short-term stress. This hormonal treatment also significantly reduced breeding success. This experimental treatment strongly supports the idea that the secretion of these two hormones might be mechanistically linked. Thus, we showed that even a relatively short-term increase in corticosterone levels can durably affect plasma prolactin levels. Therefore, the well-established suppressive action of corticosterone on parental behaviour is probably mediated and reinforced through an effect on prolactin levels. This study highlights the need to consider the potential synergistic effects of these two hormones when studying on the hormonal basis of parental decisions.",58,2009,23,4,784,793"Schaberg, PG; DeHayes, DH; Hawley, GJ",Anthropogenic calcium depletion: A unique threat to forest ecosystem health?,ECOSYSTEM HEALTH,Article,"Numerous anthropogenic factors can deplete calcium (Ca) from forest ecosystems. Because an adequate supply of Ca is needed to support fundamental biological functions, including cell membrane stability and stress response, the potential for Ca deficiency following the individual, cumulative, or potentially synergistic, influences of anthropogenic factors raises important questions concerning organism and ecosystem health. Past work has shown that one Ca-depleting factor (foliar acid mist exposure) reduces concentrations of biologically important membrane-associated Ca (mCa) from red spruce foliar cells, destabilizes these cells, and results in their increased susceptibility to the freezing injury responsible for red spruce decline in northeastern U.S. montane ecosystems. Data presented here indicate that these same disruptions can occur for other tree species and that soil-based Ca manipulation can also alter critical mCa pools. Considering the unique role Ca plays in the physiological response of cells to environmental change and stress, we hypothesize that depletion of biologically available Ca (e.g., mCa) could result in a scenario similar to recognized immune deficiency syndromes in animals. A hypothetical pathway through which anthropogenically induced Ca deficiencies could predispose plants, and possibly animals, to exaggerated injury following exposure to environmental stress is presented, and the potential implications of this scenario to ecosystem health are discussed.",58,2001,7,4,214,228"Chamberlain, K; Guerrieri, E; Pennacchio, F; Pettersson, J; Pickett, JA; Poppy, GM; Powell, W; Wadhams, LJ; Woodcock, CM",Can aphid-induced plant signals be transmitted aerially and through the rhizosphere?,BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMATICS AND ECOLOGY,Article,"Aphids, through their close association with plants, cause systemic release of semiochemicals.

Confirmation was obtained during an investigation of avoidance of unsuitable hosts by the lettuce aphid, Nasonovia ribis-nigri.

Aerial interactions between intact barley plants from different cultivars, which may be differentially releasing stress associated signals, can also influence acceptability to aphids.

An essential question, therefore, is how and to what extent do density-dependent effects influence the responses of populations to toxicant impacts? Here we consider three general types of interaction between density dependence and toxicant effects: additive, less than additive, and more than additive. If we know enough about the life-history dynamics of an organism and how its life-history traits are affected by density and toxicant exposure, we should be able to use life-history models to predict responses of populations living under density-dependent control to chemical exposure. However, because the number of factors influencing the outcome is large, we demonstrate that simple, general, a priori predictions are not feasible. A review of the literature confirms that a variety of interactions has been observed in experimental systems. It is essential that experiments are designed so that the interactions of interest can be determined. We review these critically. Experimental designs that are appropriate for exploring density-toxicant interactions on individual physiological performance may be unable to detect potential compensatory interactions at the population level. Designs most likely to simulate the dynamics of field populations will be unable to determine the mechanistic bases underlying population- level impacts. To facilitate an ecologically correct interpretation of density-toxicant interactions, it is therefore essential that the limitations of the chosen experimental designs be recognized and made explicit.",58,2001,11,4,1249,1257"Leathwick, JR; Burns, BR; Clarkson, BD",Environmental correlates of tree alpha-diversity in New Zealand primary forests,ECOGRAPHY,Article,"Correlations between environment and tree alpha-diversity in New Zealand's primary forests were examined using an extensive quantitative dataset (14 540 plots). Generalised additive models were used to examine relationships between species richness and temperature, solar radiation, root-zone moisture deficit, relative humidity, lithology, drainage, and plot size for all trees (112 species), and separately for broadleaved trees (88 species), conifers (17), and the genus Nothofagus (4). Diversity both for all tree species and for broadleaved trees was predicted to be highest on sites with high temperatures, high solar radiation, and high soil and atmospheric moisture, and on sedimentary and basaltic substrates. Highest conifer diversity was predicted on sites with intermediate temperatures, low solar radiation; high root-zone and atmospheric moisture, and rhyolitic and Quaternary substrates, particularly where drainage was impeded. Highest Nothofagus diversity was predicted for sites combining low temperatures, high solar radiation, high root-zone moisture but low atmospheric moisture, and on granitic substrates. Differences in diversity between the species groups on different lithologies are interpreted as reflecting both the effects of variation in large-scale disturbance histories, and the effects of confounding environmental factors associated with particular substrates. There were also significant interactions between species groups: both broadleaved tree and conifer richness were predicted to be lower on sites where one or more Nothofagus spp. - all of which have marked patchiness in their distribution - are present. Although these results are consistent with the hypothesis that tree diversity is highest on sites conducive to high productivity, history is also indicated as an important determinant of tree diversity in New Zealand.",58,1998,21,3,235,246"HENLEY, WJ; LINDLEY, ST; LEVAVASSEUR, G; OSMOND, CB; RAMUS, J",PHOTOSYNTHETIC RESPONSE OF ULVA-ROTUNDATA TO LIGHT AND TEMPERATURE DURING EMERSION ON AN INTERTIDAL SAND FLAT,OECOLOGIA,Article,"We have investigated the diurnal response of photosynthesis and variable photosystem II (PSII) chlorophyll fluorescence at 77 K for thalli of the chlorophyte macroalga, Ulva rotundata, grown in outdoor culture and transplanted to an intertidal sand flat in different seasons.

Except at extreme emersed temperatures in summer (38-degrees-C), the light-saturated photosynthesis rate (P(m)) did not decline at midday. In contrast, light-limited quantum yield of photosynthetic O2 exchange (phi) and the ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence yield (F(v)/F(m)) reversibly declined during midday low tides in all seasons. Shade-grown thalli exhibited a fluorescence response suggestive of greater photodamage to PSII, whereas sun-grown thalli had greater photo-protective capacity. The fluorescence decline was smaller when high tide occurred at midday, and was delayed during morning cloudiness. These results suggest that the diurnal response to PFD in this shallow water species is modified by tidal and meteorological factors.

Other studies indicate that an inadequate nocturnal food supply may negatively affect bat reproduction. The question arises therefore why do temperate insectivorous bats not fly in daylight more frequently? Four hypotheses have been advanced to explain the infrequency of daylight flying. These are overheating, competition, predation and mobbing by non-competitor species. Analysis of behavioural observations in 420 reports of daylight flying, submitted in a national (UK) daylight-flying bat survey revealed that mobbing by non-competitors was very rare (4/420 reports) and its consequences trivial. Flying with aerial insectivorous birds was more frequent (19/420 reports) but antagonism was again uncommon. Predatory attacks, mostly by avian diurnal predators occurred in 13 cases, and in at least five of these instances the attacks were fatal. Large bats survived attacks significantly more than small bats. This may explain why large species of bats flew more frequently in daylight relative to their populations than small bats. In the laboratory pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus Schreber) and brown long-eared bats (Plecotus auritus L.) avoided flying in the light. This effect occurred independently of body temperature and was not mediated by overheating. Furthermore, in the wild, bats did not avoid flying on days which were particularly hot or sunny, suggesting that in Britain overheating does not inhibit daylight flights. Heavier pipistrelle bats avoided the light more than lighter pipistrelle bats. This may reflect lower manoeuvrability and hence greater susceptibility of heavy bats (within a species) to predation, and may explain the reduced frequency of daylight-flying bats in Britain during late June and early July when they are heavily pregnant.",58,1991,5,4,518,524"Naug, D",Nutritional stress due to habitat loss may explain recent honeybee colony collapses,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,Article,"In spite of the tremendous public interest in the recent large honeybee losses attributed to colony collapse disorder, there is still no definitive explanation for the phenomenon.

We were provided the unusual opportunity for Such study, partly because the intensively monitored watersheds at the Hubbard Brook Fxperimental Forest (HBEF), New Hampshire, experienced severe canopy damage following an ice storm. Here we report the effects of this disturbance on internal N cycling and loss for watershed 1 (W1) and watershed 6 (W6) at the HBEF and patterns of N loss from nine other severely damaged watersheds across the southern White Mountains. This approach allowed us to test one component of N limitation theory, which suggests that N losses accompanying natural disturbances can lead to the maintenance of N limitation in temperate zone forest ecosystems. Prior to the ice storm, fluxes of nitrate (NO3-) at the base of W1 and W6 were similar and were much lower than N inputs in atmospheric deposition. Following the ice storm, drainage water NO3- concentrations increased to levels that were seven to ten times greater than predisturbance values. We observed no significant differences in N mineralization, nitrification, or denitrification between damaged and undamaged areas in the HBEF watersheds, however. This result suggests that elevated NO3- concentrations were not necessarily due to accelerated rates of N cycling by soil microbes but likely resulted from decreased plant uptake of NO3-. At the regional scale, we observed high variability in the magnitude of NO3- losses: while six of the surveyed watersheds showed accelerated rates of NO3- loss, three did not. Moreover, in contrast to the strong linear relationship between NO3- loss and crown damage within HBEF watersheds [r(2): (W1 = 0.91, W6 = 0.85)], streant water NO3- concentrations were weakly related to crown damage (r(2) = 0.17) across our regional sites. The efflux of NO3- associated with the ice storm was slightly higher than values reported for soil freezing and insect defoliation episodes, but was approximately two to ten times lower than NO3- fluxes associated with forest harvesting. Because over one half of the entire year's worth of N deposition was lost following the ice storm, we conclude that catastrophic disturbances contribute synergistically to the maintenance of N limitation and widely observed delays of N saturation in northern, temperate zone forest ecosystems.",57,2003,6,5,431,443"Lesser, MP",Depth-dependent photoacclimatization to solar ultraviolet radiation in the Caribbean coral Montastraea faveolata,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,Article,"The importance of solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR, 290 to 400 nm), and UVB (290 to 320 nm) in particular, as an environmental factor affecting the biology and ecology of coral reefs has taken on renewed interest since the demonstration of global stratospheric ozone loss through human activities. The hermatypic coral Montastraea faveolata occurs over a wide bathymetric range in the Florida Keys reef tract. The bathymetric range of M, faveolata and its role in reef community structure make it an important species for which to assess the effects of present day UVR irradiances. Both UVR irradiances and UVR-absorbing mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) decreased significantly with increasing depth in M, faveolata. WE irradiances were measured to a depth of 30 m during this study and maximum rates of productivity in M, faveolata were significantly affected by the presence of UVR. Action spectra (= biological weighting function) for the photoinhibition of photosynthesis by WR were measured for samples of M, faveolata at 3, 10, 18, 23, and 30 m. Using these action spectra, radiation amplification factors (RAFs) were calculated for corals at the same depths. RAFs for M, faveolata suggest that corals at depths greater than 3 m will be more sensitive to increases in WE irradiance, such as might be caused by ozone depletion, than their shallow-water counterparts. Despite this increase in sensitivity to UVB, calculations incorporating continued ozone depletion suggest that at the present rate of stratospheric ozone depletion corals deeper than 5 m in the Florida Keys will be affected very little, if at all, by increases in UVR.

Means for thorax and wing length in both species were larger at 24 degrees C than at either 18 degrees C or 31 degrees C, with the reduction in size at 18 degrees C most likely due to a nutritional constraint. Although females were larger than males, the sexes were not different for wing length/thorax length ratio. The plasticity of the traits differed between species and between populations of each species, with genetic variation in plasticity similar for the two species from one locality, but much higher for D. aldrichi from the other. Estimates of heritabilities for D. aldrichi generally were higher at 18 degrees C and 24 degrees C than at 31 degrees C, but for D. buzzatii they were highest at 31 degrees C, although heritabilities were not significantly different between species at any temperature. Additive genetic variances for D. aldrichi showed trends similar to that for heritability, being highest at 18 degrees C and decreasing as temperature increased.

Thorax and wing lengths showed significant genetic correlations that were not different between the species, but the genetic correlations between each of these traits and their ratio were significantly different. For D. aldrichi, genetic variation in the wing length/thorax length ratio was due primarily to variation in thorax length, while for D. buzzatii, it was due primarily to variation in wing length.

These two strategies have been proposed as redundant evolutionary alternatives. A late-season frost enabled us to estimate natural selection and genetic constraints on the evolution of frost resistance and tolerance in a wild plant species. We employed a genetic selection analysis (which is unbiased by environmental correlations between traits and fitness) on 75 paternal half-sibling families of annual wild radish [Raphanus raphanistrum (Brassicaceae)]. In an experimental population in southern Ontario, we found strong selection favouring plant resistance to frost, but selection against tolerance to frost. The selection against tolerance may have been caused by a cost of tolerance, as we provide evidence for a negative genetic correlation between tolerance and fitness in the absence of frost damage. Although we found no evidence for the theoretically predicted trade-off between frost tolerance and resistance among our families, we did detect negative correlational selection acting on the two traits, indicating that natural selection favoured high resistance combined with low tolerance and low resistance coupled with high tolerance, but not high or low levels of both traits together. There were few genetic correlations between the measured traits overall, but frost tolerance was negatively correlated with initial seed mass, and frost resistance was positively correlated with resistance to insect herbivory. Periodic episodes of strong selection such as that caused by the late-season frost may be disproportionately important in evolution, and are likely becoming more common because of human alterations of the environment.",56,2004,7,12,1199,1208"Leathwick, JR; Elith, J; Chadderton, WL; Rowe, D; Hastie, T","Dispersal, disturbance and the contrasting biogeographies of New Zealand's diadromous and non-diadromous fish species",JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,Article,"Aim To examine the relationship between diadromy and dispersal ability in New Zealand's freshwater fish fauna, and how this affects the current environmental and geographic distributions of both diadromous and non-diadromous species. Location New Zealand. Methods Capture data for 15 diadromous and 15 non-diadromous fish species from 13,369 sites throughout New Zealand were analysed to establish features of their geographic ranges. Statistical models were used to determine the main environmental correlates of species' distributions, and to establish the environmental conditions preferred by each species. Environmental predictors, chosen for their functional relevance, were derived from an extensive GIS database describing New Zealand's river and stream network. Results in terms of geography, most diadromous species occur in a scattered fashion throughout extensive geographic ranges, and occupy large numbers of catchments of widely varying size. By contrast, most non-diadromous species show relatively high levels of occupancy of smaller geographic ranges, and most are restricted to a few large catchments, particularly in the eastern South Island. In terms of environment, there is marked separation of diadromous from non-diadromous species, with diadromous species generally caught most frequently in low-gradient coastal rivers and streams with warm, maritime climates. With a few notable exceptions, most diadromous species have lower occurrence in river segments that are located above obstacles to upstream migration. Non-diadromous species are usually caught in inland rivers and streams with cool, strongly seasonal climates, typified by a low frequency of high-intensity rainfall events. Main conclusions We interpret the contrasting biogeographies of New Zealand's diadromous and non-diadromous species as reflecting interaction between their marked differences in dispersal ability and a landscape that is subject to recurrent, often large-scale, natural disturbance. While both groups are likely to be equally susceptible to local, disturbance-driven extinction, the much greater dispersal ability of diadromous species has allowed them to persist over wide geographic ranges. By contrast, the distributions of most non-diadromous species are concentrated in a few large catchments, mostly in regions where less intense natural disturbance regimes are likely to have favoured their survival.",55,2008,35,8,1481,1497"Holland, B",Sexual selection fails to promote adaptation to a new environment,EVOLUTION,Article,"Selection can be divided into sexual and nonsexual components. Some work finds that a component of sexual selection, adaptive female selection for good genes, can promote nonsexual fitness. Less studied is the benefit from sexual selection in tote, that is, when intra- and intersexual selection are both present and able to affect females directly and indirectly. Here an upper bound for the net benefit of sexual selection is estimated for Drosophila melanogaster. Replicate populations were allowed to adapt to low-grade thermal stress, with or with out the operation of sexual selection. Because proteins and lipids are highly sensitive to temperature, low-grade thermal stress will select broadly across the genome for alternative alleles. Such broad, directional selection for thermal tolerance should increase the measurable benefits of sexual selection far beyond that available under stabilizing selection. Sexual selection was removed by enforced monogamy without mate choice and retained by enforced polyandry (four males per female). After 36 generations of thermal stress exposure, there was substantial adaptation to the new environment (the net reproductive rate increased six standard deviations relative to thermal controls). However, sexual selection did not affect the rate of adaptation. Therefore, adaptive female selection for thermal tolerance either was insignificant or negated by other aspects of sexual selection, for example, male-induced female harm, which has been shown to diminish under monogamy. This experiment employed two parameters that reduced the opportunity for divergence in such harm: a truncated intersexual interaction period and strong directional selection for thermal tolerance. No divergence in male-induced harm was observed.",55,2002,56,4,721,730"Tremblay, R; Myrand, B; Sevigny, JM; Blier, P; Guderley, H","Bioenergetic and genetic parameters in relation to susceptibility of blue mussels, Mytilus edulis (L.) to summer mortality",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,Article,"Our study examined whether the differences in susceptibility to summer mass mortality of two stocks of mussels from the Magdalen Islands (Quebec, Canada) are related to bioenergetic and/or genetic factors. The relative importance of maintenance and maximal metabolic rates, scope for growth (SFG) and the O:N ratio were followed over time to assess whether the increased incidence of mortality in late summer reflects a decrease in bioenergetic status at this period. The stock of mussels which was more susceptible to summer mortality had higher values of V-O2. Furthermore this stock had a more negative scope for growth and lower O/N ratio in early August. These parameters are Likely to reflect unfavourable environmental conditions, which led the mussels to rely upon protein catabolism. We also observed a negative correlation between multiple-locus heterozygosity and standard V-O2. The more susceptible stock of mussels had a lower degree of multiple-locus heterozygosity. Thus, we suggest that the periodic, but irregular, outbreaks of summer mortality are the result of a synergistic interaction involving dietary deficiencies, temperature, a possible post-spawning, stress and the genetic characteristics of the stock. The higher metabolic demand associated with a reduced degree of heterozygosity will impose a supplementary stress and render such stocks more vulnerable to summer mortality. The results are in agreement with the hypothesis that high levels of heterozygosity are related with lower costs of maintenance.

The primary consequence of agriculture, wildfires, and extensive fires ignited by the military during training activities was loss of native shrubs from the landscape. Agriculture created large square blocks on the landscape, and the landscape contained fewer small patches and more large shrub patches than non-agricultural areas. In contrast, fires left a more fragmented landscape. Repeated fires did not change the distribution of patch sizes, but decreased the total area of remaining shrublands and increased the distance between remaining shrub patches that provide seed sources. Military training with tracked vehicles was associated with a landscape characterized by small, closely spaced, shrub patches. Our results support the general model hypothesized for conversion of shrublands to annual grasslands by disturbance. Larger shrub patches in our region, historically resistant to fire spread and large-scale fires because of a perennial bunchgrass understory, were more fragmented than small patches. Presence of cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), an exotic annual, was positively related to landscape patchiness and negatively related to number of shrub cells. Thus, cheatgrass dominance can contribute to further fragmentation and loss of the shrub patch by facilitating spread of subsequent fires, carried by continuous fuels, through the patch. The synergistic processes of fragmentation of shrub patches by disturbance, invasion and subsequent dominance by exotic annuals, and fire are converting shrubsteppe in southwestern Idaho to a new state dominated by exotic annual grasslands and high fire frequencies.",55,1997,12,5,287,297"Lancaster, J",Scaling the effects of predation and disturbance in a patchy environment,OECOLOGIA,Article,"The effects of hydraulic disturbances on the impact of two predatory benthic invertebrates on their prey were examined in a stream at two distinct spatial scales. At the scale of small habitat patches (0.0625 m(2)), hydraulic patch type was an important determinant of the microdistribution of prey and predators. Prey abundances were similar across all patch types at baseflow, but local densities were higher in patches identified as low-flow refugia after periods of high and fluctuating flow. The microdistribution pattern of predatory larvae of a caddisfly, Plectrocnemia conspersa, was similar to that of its prey, whereas predatory larvae of an alderfly, Sialis fuliginosa, did not shift their microdistribution significantly with discharge and were always most abundant in low-flow refugia. There was little evidence of an aggregative response of predators with prey, even though both predators and prey are mobile. Both predator species showed similar patch-specific patterns of per capita consumption rates: uniform consumption-rates across hydraulic patch types at low and moderate flows, but highest in flow refugia during high flows. Species-specific patterns, however, were apparent in the magnitude and direction of differences between consumption rates during disturbance events, and in comparable patches at base flow: At high flow, consumption rates for P. conspersa were exaggerated (3.9 times higher) in flow refugia but ''at par'' in other patches; for S. fuliginosa they were ''at par'' in flow refugia but reduced in other patches (up to 3.3. times lower). These differences may be related to species-specific foraging behaviours (search vs ambush predators) and the influence of prey movements on feeding success. Using the patch-scale results only, it is difficult to predict the effects of physical disturbance on predation intensity at the larger scales of whole habitats, populations or communities. At the large scale (>200 m(2)), net predator impacts were estimated over the stream reach, using a spatially explicit model that accounts, in an additive way, for habitat heterogeneity and patch-specific responses of predators and prey. The relationship between predator impact over the whole reach and hydraulic disturbance differed for the two predators. The predator impact of S. fuliginosa decreased with increasing hydraulic disturbance, as predicted by the harsh-benign hypothesis. There was no directional trend for P. conspersa, however, and maximum predator impact may occur at intermediate disturbance levels. For the prey community in this stream, predation pressure from S. fuliginosa appears to fluctuate directly with the discharge hydrograph, whereas predation from P. conspersa may be more persistent. Flow refugia may play a dual role in the sructure of stream communities by preventing catastrophic mortality of animals (predators and prey) from physical forces during disturbances, and by maintaining (or perhaps increasing) predation pressure. Summing the effects of species interactions in small habitat patches to the larger scale of a whole stream reach indicates that the scale of approach influences the observed patterns and their implied underlying process.",55,1996,107,3,321,331"Hall, AR; Scanlan, PD; Morgan, AD; Buckling, A",Host-parasite coevolutionary arms races give way to fluctuating selection,ECOLOGY LETTERS,Article,"Host-parasite coevolution is a key driver of biological diversity and parasite virulence, but its effects depend on the nature of coevolutionary dynamics over time.

We attribute this effect to increasing costs of generalism for phages and bacteria with increasing infectivity and resistance. By contrast, fluctuating selection on individual host and parasite genotypes was maintained over time, becoming increasingly important for the phenotypic properties of parasite and host populations.

I manipulated the functional group composition of native algal communities and invaded them with the introduced, Japanese seaweed Sargassum muticum to understand how individual functional groups contributed to overall invasion resistance. The results suggested that space preemption by crustose and turfy algae inhibited S. muticum recruitment and that light preemption by canopy and understory algae reduced S. muticum survivorship. However, other mechanisms I did not investigate could have contributed to these two results. In this marine community the sequential preemption of key resources by different functional groups in different stages of the invasion generated resistance to invasion by S. muticum. Rather than acting collectively on a single resource the functional groups in this system were important for preempting either space or light, but not both resources. My experiment has important implications for diversity-invasibility studies, which typically look for an effect of diversity on individual resources. Overall invasion resistance will be due to the additive effects of individual functional groups (or species) summed over an invader's life cycle. Therefore, the cumulative effect of multiple functional groups (or species) acting on multiple resources is an alternative mechanism that could generate negative relationships between diversity and invasibility in a variety of biological systems.",54,2006,113,3,395,401"Kulakowski, D; Veblen, TT",Influences of fire history and topography on the pattern of a severe wind blowdown in a Colorado subalpine forest,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Article,"1 In 1997, a major windstorm blew down over 10 000 hectares of subalpine forest in Routt National Forest in north-western Colorado.

We reconstructed the spatial fire history in a c. 4400 ha area by first identifying distinct patches in the landscape on aerial photographs, and then in the field by determining the disturbance history of each patch by dating fire scars, ages of post-fire cohorts and releases of remnant trees. 3 Both topographic position and fire history contribute to susceptibility to wind damage. Stands at higher elevations, on easterly slopes and closer to ridges were most affected. Younger stands (i.e. more recently affected by stand-initiating fires) were less affected particularly in areas affected by low-moderate severity blowdown (< 80% damage). The ecological effects of the very severe 1997 windstorm were mediated by the legacies of fires which occurred several centuries ago.

The predators used (Saduria entomon and Crangon crangon) are the major epibenthic crustacean predators of the northern Baltic coastal waters. and the prey organism in the experiments (the bivalve Macoma balthica) is, by frequency of occurrence and by biomass, the dominant infaunal organism among the zoobenthos. In the field the predatory effect of Saduria was tested on the entire infaunal community. The field experiment on direct predation by Saduria on the entire infaunal assemblage significantly reduced the density of the polychaete Manayunkia aestuarina.

Widespread and rapid losses of tropical rain forests have made understanding the responses of species to rain forest fragmentation an area of major concern. In this study we examined the impacts of habitat fragmentation on the species richness and faunal composition of butterflies in tropical rain forests in Sabah, Borneo. We analysed patterns of both alpha- and beta-diversity to assess the relative importance of differences in patch size, isolation and vegetation structure on the diversity and similarity of species assemblages. We used additive partitioning to assess the relative contributions of intact forest and forest remnants to overall species richness at a landscape scale and we examined which traits of species best predicted their responses to fragmentation. 2. Species richness and diversity in rain forest remnants was significantly positively related to remnant size and significantly negatively related to isolation, in keeping with theories of island biogeography. Species assemblages at different sites were significantly nested, with those species most adversely affected by forest fragmentation having a narrow range of larval host-plants and, to a lesser extent, being large-bodied. No species endemic to Borneo was recorded in forest remnants smaller than 4000 ha, but even the smallest remnant (120 ha) supported species with geographical distributions confined within Sundaland (West Malaysia and the islands of the Sunda Shelf). 3. Although assemblages were significantly nested, they departed substantially from perfect nestedness, with some species recorded only or predominantly in small, relatively depauperate remnants. As a result there was substantial beta-diversity among sites, which was related to variation in both fragment size and vegetation structure. At the landscape scale, diversity within sites was less than that between sites, and the majority of the diversity between sites was related to variation in fragment size. 4. Synthesis and applications. Substantial diversity was added to the assemblage of butterflies in Bornean rain forests by virtue of species differences among fragments, which were related mainly to differences in patch size and vegetation structure. The data reported indicate that, despite having lower species richness, relatively small and isolated remnants of rain forest make a substantial contribution to regional diversity. Small isolated forest remnants are generally accorded low conservation status and given little protection, with the result that they often disappear over time because of continued anthropogenic disturbance. The results of this study indicate that the conservation value of small remnants of forest, in particular their contribution to environmental heterogeneity, should not be overlooked.",53,2006,43,5,967,977"Stephenson, AG; Leyshon, B; Travers, SE; Hayes, CN; Winsor, JA","Interrelationships among inbreeding, herbivory, and disease on reproduction in a wild gourd",ECOLOGY,Article,"Because inbreeding, herbivory, and disease are common in plants and their separate impacts on fitness are well documented, investigators have begun to examine the consequences of inbreeding on plant-herbivore and plant-pathogen interactions. In this study, we examined the interrelationships among inbreeding, herbivory, and disease on reproductive output through both male (pollen production and pollen performance) and female (fruit and seed production and seed germination) functions. Inbred (selfed) and outbred plants from five families of a wild gourd (Cucurbita pepo ssp. texana) were grown in five 0.2-ha randomized blocks in an experimental garden. Half of the inbred and half of the outbred plants were sprayed weekly with a contact pesticide to control herbivores. The other half of the plants served as the controls (no-spray treatment). The spray treatment significantly reduced damage by cucumber beetles and aphid infestation levels, the two primary herbivores of the wild gourd. Moreover, because these herbivores are the sole vectors for the five most common viral diseases of cucurbits (Watermelon mosaic-2, Cucumber mosaic, Zucchini yellow mosaic, Papaya ringspot, and Squash mosaic), the spray treatment also significantly reduced the amount and severity of the symptoms of viral diseases. Our analyses reveal that (1) there is variation for resistance to herbivores and pathogens among the five families used in the Study, indicating that there is broad-sense heritability for resistance; (2) inbred plants suffer greater herbivore damage and have more symptoms of viral infection than outbred plants, i.e., there is inbreeding depression for herbivore/pathogen resistance; (3) the impacts of insecticide applications and inbreeding on reproduction are mostly additive; (4) both male and female functions are significantly affected by the spray treatment and inbreeding; and (5) the adverse effects of both inbreeding and the increased exposure to herbivores/pathogens in the no-spray treatment are greater for female function than for male function, indicating that the impact of genetic and environmental stress can differentially affect the two sexual functions.

In grasslands, land use is often classified by categorical descriptors such as pastures versus meadows or fertilized versus unfertilized sites. However, to account for the quantitative variation of multiple land-use types in heterogeneous landscapes, a quantitative, continuous index of land-use intensity (LUI) is desirable. Here we define such a compound, additive LUI index for managed grasslands including meadows and pastures. The LUI index summarizes the standardized intensity of three components of land use, namely fertilization, mowing, and livestock grazing at each site. We examined the performance of the LUI index to predict selected response variables on up to 150 grassland sites in the Biodiversity Exploratories in three regions in Germany(Alb, Hainich, Schorlheide). We tested the average Ellenberg nitrogen indicator values of the plant community, nitrogen and phosphorus concentration in the aboveground plant biomass, plant-available phosphorus concentration in the top soil, and soil C/N ratio, and the first principle component of these five response variables. The LUI index significantly predicted the principal component of all five response variables, as well as some of the individual responses. Moreover, vascular plant diversity decreased significantly with LUI in two regions (Alb and Hainich). Inter-annual changes in management practice were pronounced from 2006 to 2008, particularly due to variation in grazing intensity. This rendered the selection of the appropriate reference year(s) an important decision for analyses of land-use effects, whereas details in the standardization of the index were of minor importance. We also tested several alternative calculations of a LUI index, but all are strongly linearly correlated to the proposed index. The proposed LUI index reduces the complexity of agricultural practices to a single dimension and may serve as a baseline to test how different groups of organisms and processes respond to land use. In combination with more detailed analyses, this index may help to unravel whether and how land-use intensities, associated disturbance levels or other local or regional influences drive ecological processes.",52,2012,13,3,207,220"Moles, AT; Flores-Moreno, H; Bonser, SP; Warton, DI; Helm, A; Warman, L; Eldridge, DJ; Jurado, E; Hemmings, FA; Reich, PB; Cavender-Bares, J; Seabloom, EW; Mayfield, MM; Sheil, D; Djietror, JC; Peri, PL; Enrico, L; Cabido, MR; Setterfield, SA; Lehmann, CER; Thomson, FJ","Invasions: the trail behind, the path ahead, and a test of a disturbing idea",JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Article,1.

The current hypothesis predicts that the role of facilitation becomes increasingly important in conjunction with increasing stress. Several empirical studies, however, failed to detect such patterns, particularly at the extreme ends of the stress gradients. Herein, we present a conceptual model that may resolve discrepancies between expected and observed and provides a more precise framework of the existing hypotheses. By relaxing two common assumptions commonly used by the stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH) we are able to demonstrate that under some circumstances the importance of facilitation may be less at the extreme ends of these gradients. Namely, we first re-emphasize the notion that physiological response is not linear with respect to environmental changes along stress gradients. Second, it is argued that the net outcome of facilitative and competitive interactions is reflected in the fitness of individuals as a product of these two processes, in contrast to the commonly applied assumption of additivity. Accordingly, a synthesis of the concepts of population biology (measures of fitness) and plant physiology (nonlinear responses) with the stress gradient hypothesis while retaining the original simplicity of the SGH model contributes to a better specification of the predictions of the stress-gradient hypothesis and the resolution of observed contradictions.",51,2010,119,10,1546,1552"Davidson, C; Knapp, RA",Multiple stressors and amphibian declines: Dual impacts of pesticides and fish on yellow-legged frogs,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,Article,"More than 40% of Earth's 5700+ amphibian species have undergone recent declines.

In California ( USA), separate studies have implicated either introduced. sh or pesticides as causal agents. To date, however, no study has simultaneously evaluated the respective roles of these two potential stressors nor attempted to assess their relative importance, information critical for the development of effective conservation efforts and environmental policies. We examined the role and relative effect of. sh and pesticides on the mountain yellow-legged frog ( Rana muscosa) using unusually detailed data sets for a large portion of R. muscosa's historic range in California's Sierra Nevada. Habitat characteristics and presence/ absence of R. muscosa and. sh were quantified at each of 6831 sites during field surveys. Pesticide use upwind of each site was calculated from pesticide application records and predominant wind directions. Using generalized additive models, we found that, after accounting for habitat effects, the probability of R. muscosa presence was significantly reduced by both. sh and pesticides, with the landscape-scale effect of pesticides much stronger than that of. sh. The degree to which a site was sheltered from the predominant wind ( and associated pesticides) was also a significant predictor of R. muscosa presence. Taken together, these results represent the strongest evidence to date that windborne pesticides are contributing to amphibian declines in pristine locations.

Because selection is generally weaker late in life, genes or traits that improve early-life performance but impair late-life performance should come to predominate. Variation in the strength of age-specific selection should then generate adaptive variation in senescence. We demonstrate this mechanism by comparing early and late breeders within a population of semelparous capital-breeding sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). We show that early breeders (but not late breeders) are under strong selection for a long reproductive lifespan (RLS), which facilitates defence of their nests against disturbance by later females. Accordingly, early females invest less energy in egg production while reserving more for nest defence. Variation along this reproductive trade-off causes delayed or slower senescence in early females (average RLS of 26 days) than in late females (reproductive lifespan of 12 days). We use microsatellites to confirm that gene flow is sufficiently limited between early and late breeders to allow adaptive divergence in response to selection.

Ultraviolet-B radiation reduced survival of amphibians by 1.9-fold compared with shielded controls.

By contrast, grazing has been shown to increase the species density and richness of vascular plants, especially on productive soils. In order to test the suggested differences in response to management between plants and insects, we simultaneously studied species richness of vascular plants and their insect herbivores, butterflies and moths, in 68 semi-natural grasslands with varying grazing intensity and frequency in SW Finland. Species richness of plants and insects was for the first time related to a quantitative measure of disturbance intensity and successional age, mean vegetation height, by using generalized additive models (GAM). The effects of soil nutrients on vegetation height were accounted for by using phosphorus concentration as a productivity surrogate. The results showed that species richness of butterflies and moths peaked in taller vegetation compared with vascular plants, corresponding to a lower disturbance intensity and increasing time since abandonment. These patterns are discussed in the light of two hypotheses, the ""structural diversity hypothesis"" and ""dynamic equilibrium model"" of Huston, both suggesting a weaker disturbance tolerance of insects compared with plants. Butterflies and moths which are specialists in their larval host-plant use (monophagous and oligophagous species) preferred lower vegetation (higher disturbances) compared with generalists (polyphagous species), as predicted by Huston's model.

The number of attribute groups and number of species within each group increased with area, suggesting both increased diversity and coexistence within niches. With altitude, the number of attribute groups declined, but the number of species per group increased, consistent with a loss of richness and reduced competition.

Belowground, elevated CO2 had only minor effects, whereas warming increased N turnover, as indicated by increased rates of microbial NH4+ consumption, gross mineralization, potential nitrification, denitrification and N2O emissions. Drought reduced belowground gross N mineralization and decreased fauna N mass and fauna N mineralization. Leaching was unaffected by treatments but was significantly higher across all treatments in the second year than in the much drier first year indicating that ecosystem N loss is highly sensitive to changes and variability in amount and timing of precipitation. Interactions between treatments were common and although some synergistic effects were observed, antagonism dominated the interactive responses in treatment combinations, i.e. responses were smaller in combinations than in single treatments. Nonetheless, increased C/N ratios of photosynthetic tissue in response to elevated CO2, as well as drought-induced decreases in litter N production and fauna N mineralization prevailed in the full treatment combination. Overall, the simulated future climate scenario therefore lead to reduced N turnover, which could act to reduce the potential growth response of plants to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration.",49,2011,17,5,1884,1899"Galvan, I; Alonso-Alvarez, C",The expression of melanin-based plumage is separately modulated by exogenous oxidative stress and a melanocortin,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,Article,"Melanin-based traits involved in animal communication have been traditionally viewed as occurring under strict genetic control. However, it is generally accepted that both genetic and environmental factors influence melanin production. Medical studies suggest that, among environmental factors influencing melanization, oxidative stress could play a relevant role. On the other hand, genetic control would be exerted by the melanocortin system, and particularly by the alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), which triggers the production of eumelanins (black pigments). To determine how the melanocortin system and an exogenous source of oxidative stress interact in the expression of melanin-based plumage, developing red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa) were manipulated. Some partridges were injected with alpha-MSH, while other birds received a pro-oxidant molecule (diquat) in drinking water. Controls and birds receiving both treatments were also studied. Both alpha-MSH- and diquat-treated individuals presented larger eumelanin-based traits than controls, but alpha-MSH+diquat-treated birds showed the largest traits, suggesting that oxidative stress and melanocortins promote additive but independent effects. Diquat also induced a decline in the level of a key intracellular antioxidant (glutathione), which is associated with high expression of eumelanin-based signals in other bird species. Some scenarios for the evolution of melanin-based traits in relation to oxidative stress are proposed.",49,2009,276,1670,3089,3097"Reusch, TBH; Williams, SL",Macrophyte canopy structure and the success of an invasive marine bivalve,OIKOS,Article,"In both terrestrial and aquatic environments introductions of non-indigenous species are continuing and represent one important component of global change. Negative biotic interactions by resident species may prevent successful invaders from becoming pests. Few experimental data are available on the presence and significance of such biotic resistance other than predation or competition. This study addresses the role of habitat structure provided by a native eelgrass (Zostera marina) canopy on growth and survival of the non-indigenous mussel Musculista senhousia, a habitat-modifying gregarious suspension feeder with strong effects on native infauna and eelgrass. In 2 southern California bays, a series of transplantation experiments using tagged mussels revealed that inside an eelgrass canopy, Musculista growth rates were reduced by more than half in 3 of 4 experiments compared to adjacent unvegetated areas. Musculista survival also decreased inside the vegetation in a 4-mo experiment. As one element of habitat structure, we tested the effects of eelgrass parch size, using natural (1 site) and planted (1 site) eelgrass patches of defined sizes. Growth rates of Musculista were highest outside the veneration and decreased as eelgrass patch size increased. As a potential mechanism for the canopy effects, we suggest that Musculista receives less food inside the vegetation. In the experimental plots, the presence and spatial extent of the macrophyte canopy strongly affected near bottom (10 cm) horizontal water flow assessed with a direct dye tracking method. Reduced mussel growth rates were linearly associated with lower water flow, and presumably, food flux. Over a period of 7 mo, food resources (particulate chlorophyll a) were consistently lower 1 and 5 cm above the sea floor inside eelgrass patches compared to the sand Aat. The reduction in food availability matched the growth reduction of Musculista. Also, mussel condition (dry flesh mass/shell mass) was worse in individuals growing in eelgrass than in the sand Aat. Previous experiments revealed that dense beds of Musculista impede the rhizome growth and vegetative propagation of eelgrass, yet mussels attain abundances sufficient for interference only if eelgrass beds are patchy. Thus, anthropogenic disturbances on eelgrass beds, which often result in meadow fragmentation, and the proliferation of Musculista may have synergistic negative effects on the persistence of eelgrass beds.",49,1999,84,3,398,416"PYKE, DA; ARCHER, S",PLANT-PLANT INTERACTIONS AFFECTING PLANT ESTABLISHMENT AND PERSISTENCE ON REVEGETATED RANGELAND,JOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT,Article,"Restoration and revegetation of rangeland ecosystems is based on knowledge of abiotic and biotic interactions that affect plant establishment. Once plants become autotrophic, interactions within and between plant species may occur and these interactions may range from antagonistic to mutualistic. This full range of potential interactions needs to be considered to ensure successful revegetation. At the intraspecific level, we propose the development and use of density-yield diagrams for rangeland species. These diagrams would be based on the self-thinning principle, that aboveground biomass is related to plant density and to the dynamic process of density-dependent mortality. The proposed approach would be used to determine optimum seeding rates, and to predict future biomass of revegetated rangeland. At the interspecific level, competitive relationships of species used to reseed rangelands need to be identified to enhance the probability that species will coexist and thereby facilitate greater species diversity on the site. A diversity of species and growth forms may provide a more stable cover and productivity than a monoculture on sites characterized by environmental variability while potentially enhancing nutrient status for the site.",49,1991,44,6,550,557"Jennings, S; Nicholson, MD; Dinmore, TA; Lancaster, JE",Effects of chronic trawling disturbance on the production of infaunal communities,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,Article,"Trawling. causes widespread physical disturbance in shallow shelf seas. While the impacts of trawling on the biomass and community structure of benthic fauna are well known, no existing studies have quantified the effects of trawling disturbance on the absolute production of small benthic infauna. We investigated the effects of beam trawling disturbance on the production of small benthic infauna (AFDM > 0.78 to 62.5 mg) at 9 sites that were subject to a 17.5-fold range in annual trawling disturbance, using a size-based approach that could be applied to other soft-bottom systems. We developed a generalised additive model to test for relationships between trawling disturbance and infaunal production and size structure, after accounting for differences in sediment characteristics and depth. The statistical power of our analyses to detect linear and non-linear relationships between production and disturbance, including increased production at intermediate levels of disturbance, was high (>90% probability of detecting a 50% change in production across the range of disturbance). The analyses showed that trawling frequencies of 0.35 to 6.14 times yr(-1) did not have a significant effect on the production of small infauna or polychaetes. This result contrasts with order of magnitude decreases in the production of large infauna, and shows that small polychaetes with fast life histories are less vulnerable to trawling disturbance. Since small infaunal polychaetes are a key source of food for flatfishes, we conclude that beam trawling disturbance does not have a positive or negative effect on their food supply.",48,2002,243,,251,260"Nilsson, T; Fricke, C; Arnqvist, G",Patterns of divergence in the effects of mating on female reproductive performance in flour beetles,EVOLUTION,Article,"Sexual selection can lead to rapid divergence in reproductive characters. Recent studies have indicated that postmating events, such as sperm precedence, may play a key role in speciation. Here, we stress that other components of postmating sexual selection may be involved in the evolution of reproductive isolation. One of these is the reproductive investment made by females after mating (i.e., differential allocation). We performed an experiment designed to assess genetic divergence in the effects of mating on female reproductive performance in flour beetles, Tribolium castaneum. Females were mated to mates of three different wild-type genotypes at two different frequencies, in all possible reciprocal combinations. Male genotype affected all aspects of female reproduction. through its effects on female longevity. total offspring production, reproductive rate. mating rate. and fertility. Moreover, male and female genotype interacted in their effects on offspring production and reproductive rate. We use the pattern of these interactions to discuss the evolutionary process of divergence and suggest that the pattern is most consistent with that expected if divergence was driven by sexually antagonistic coevolution. In particular, the fact that females exhibited a relatively weak response to males with which they were coevolved suggests that females have evolved resistance to male gonadotropic signals/stimuli.",48,2002,56,1,111,120"Michalski, F; Peres, CA",Disturbance-mediated mammal persistence and abundance-area relationships in Amazonian forest fragments,CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,Article,"Few researchers have investigated the synergistic effects of tropical forest fragmentation and disturbance on species persistence and abundance. We examined effects of both forest-patch metrics and forest disturbance in determining richness and abundance of midsized to large-bodied mammal species in a highly fragmented Amazonian forest landscape. Twenty-one forest fragments, ranging from 2 to 14,480 ha, and two continuous forest sites were sampled based on sightings, tracks, line-transect censuses, armadillo burrow censuses, and camera trapping. Patch occupancy of 37 species recorded ranged from 4% to all forest sites surveyed. Forest fragment size was the strongest predictor of species persistence, explaining 90% of the variation in species richness. Information-theoretic analysis confirmed that fragment area was the most important explanatory variable for the overall species richness and abundance of mammal species, followed by surface fires, which affected the abundance of seven species. Large mammal species were typically absent from fragments < 100 ha, whereas some ubiquitous species were favored by fragmentation, exhibiting hyperabundance in small patches.

Much ecological theory is based on the characterization of ecological habits of species as 'generalist' or 'specialist', but standard measures for placing species along a generalist-specialist gradient do not exist. 2. We introduce a method for quantifying habitat specialization (i.e. relative niche widths) using species co-occurrence data. Generalists should co-occur with many species, whereas specialists should co-occur with relatively few species, given equal plot occurrences. We quantify this concept using a generalist-specialist metric (theta) derived from a beta diversity statistic. 3. We evaluate the ability of our generalist-specialist metric to correctly rank species according to simulated (known) niche widths. Our technique is generally robust to a wide variety of niche distribution structures and sampling designs, but surveys strongly biased toward certain habitats can undermine the ability of theta to accurately describe niche widths for underrepresented species. 4. We apply our technique to three spatially nested surveys of the large woody flora (> 1 cm d.b.h.) of the south-eastern USA. For each dataset we rank the generalist-specialist tendencies of all species of non-trivial occurrences, including 113 species across the Southeast, 71 species of southern Appalachian forests, and 44 species of the 6800-ha Joyce Kilmer-Slickrock Wilderness Area (NC and TN, USA). 5. Rankings of species' theta-values were generally consistent among datasets of different spatial extent. Generalist species (e.g. Ilex opaca, Ulmus rubra, Morus rubra, Prunus serotina, Acer rubrum) were often those with large geographical ranges, particularly for theta-values from the largest dataset, and overall were more likely to be bird-dispersed, deciduous, and shade tolerant. South-eastern specialist species (e.g. Taxodium spp., Abies fraseri, Quercus laevis, Pinus pungens, Pinus palustris) were those associated with stressful or unusual conditions, such as a long duration of flooding, high fire frequency, or extreme cold or dry climates. 6. Our study demonstrates that increasingly available, large-survey datasets can contribute niche-related species information in the absence of detailed environmental or habitat measurements.

In several naturally promiscuous insect species, experimental evolution studies that have enforced monogamy found evidence for sexual conflict. Here, we subjected the naturally promiscuous, sperm-heteromorphic fruit fly Drosophila pseudoobscura to enforced monogamy, standard levels of promiscuity, and elevated opportunities for promiscuity in four replicate lines. We examined the effect of male and female selection history and the proximate effect of variation in male density on female fitness parameters. We found that male density rather than male selection history explained a greater degree of female fecundity, egg hatching success, and productivity. Additionally, females selected under elevated promiscuity had greater fecundity and hatching success than did enforced monogamy females. Selection line males do not differ in their capacity to coerce females to remate, suggesting no divergence in precopulatory manipulative ability. However, these males did vary in their ability to suppress female remating, suggesting postcopulatory manipulation. These results indicate that sexual conflict can be manifested through both the proximate effects of male density and the historical levels of sexual selection and that the sexes respond differentially to these factors and further stress the multifarious channels of sexual communication that contribute to fitness.",47,2005,165,5,S72,S87"Pakkasmaa, S; Merila, J; O'Hara, RB",Genetic and maternal effect influences on viability of common frog tadpoles under different environmental conditions,HEREDITY,Article,"The influence of environmental stress on the expression of genetic and maternal effects on the viability traits has seldom been assessed in wild vertebrates. We have estimated genetic and maternal effects on the viability (viz probability of survival, probability of being deformed, and body size and shape) of common frog, Rana temporaria, tadpoles under stressful (low pH) and nonstressful (neutral pH) environmental conditions. A Bayesian analysis using generalized linear mixed models was applied to data from a factorial laboratory experiment. The expression of additive genetic variance was independent of pH treatments, and all traits were significantly heritable (survival: h(2) approximate to 0.08; deformities: h(2) approximate to 0.26; body size: h(2) approximate to 0.12; body shape: h(2) approximate to 0.14). Likewise, nonadditive genetic contributions to variation in all traits were significant, independent of pH treatments and typically of magnitude similar to the additive genetic effects. Maternal effects were large for all traits, especially for viability itself, and their expression was partly dependent on the environment. In the case of body size, the maternal effects were mediated largely through egg size. In general, the results give little evidence for the conjecture that environmental stress created by low pH would impact strongly on the genetic architecture of fitness-related traits in frogs, and hamper adaptation to stress caused by acidification.

Animals from laboratory cultures were exposed to 6 different FLU concentrations (range 0 to 80 mu g FLU [g dry wt sed](-1), ppm) at 3 population densities (range 529 to 36 842 worms m(-2)), and survivorship, growth rate until maturity and reproductive parameters were recorded. Fluoranthene exposure significantly reduced juvenile survivorship in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas population density had no effect on this trait. In contrast, increasing density (= food limitation) was associated with significant decreases in body size at maturity and increased time to maturity, while FLU had. no effect on these traits. Effects of FLU on time to first reproduction, % reproducing females, larvae per brood, broods per female and population growth rate (lambda) varied in response to the intensity of density dependence. In general, interactions between FLU and density were compensatory (antagonistic) at low toxicant exposures, but synergistic at the highest. Population effects are summarised by effects on population growth rate. Our main result is that at low concentrations of FLU (0 to 40 ppm), increasing density alleviated FLU's effects on lambda. Thus increasing FLU decreased lambda at low density but had no effect at high density. At the highest concentrations of FLU, however, the reverse was the case ('synergistic effects'). Here, the effect of increasing density is to exacerbate the effects of FLU. This result is particularly important because it demonstrates that LTREs carried out at low density (non-food limited), as most have been in the past, may seriously underestimate effects in the field, where densities are generally high and likely to produce food limitation, as here. Our results suggest that when food availability is limiting, the impact of low levels of toxicant stress on population dynamics may be marginal. By contrast at higher toxicant exposures, food Limitation exacerbates toxicant effects and may increase the likelihood of extinction.",46,1999,184,,139,148"Boonstra, R; Hochachka, WM",Maternal effects and additive genetic inheritance in the collared lemming Dicrostonyx groenlandicus,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY,Article,"We examined patterns of inheritance of size, growth and behavioural traits of collared lemmings (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus).

We found no evidence of statistically significant amounts of additive genetic variance in any of the traits measured. However, significant maternal effects were detected for several size- and growth-related traits. Three behavioural traits involving aggression, dispersal and activity showed no statistically significant inheritance of any kind.

At the same time, the dissolution of CO2 into seawater is increasing surface ocean acidity, a process known as ocean acidification. Effects of ocean acidification on marine primary producers have been documented to be stimulative, inhibitive, or neutral. Elevated CO2 and reduced pH levels can interact with solar radiation, which fluctuates over different time scales from limiting to saturating or even stressful levels, to bring about synergistic, antagonistic, or balanced effects on marine primary producers at different depths or under changing weather conditions. However, shoaling of the upper mixed layer (enhanced stratification) due to ocean warming and freshening (rain, ice melting) can lead to additional photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and ultraviolet (UV) exposure, which can have both benefits and costs to photosynthetic organisms. Elevated CO2 concentrations under low or moderate levels of PAR have been shown to enhance photosynthesis or growth of both phytoplankton and macroalgae; excessive levels of PAR, however, can lead to additional inhibition of photosynthesis or growth under elevated CO2, and addition of UV radiation (280 to 400 nm) can increase or down-regulate such inhibition, since solar UV-B (280 to 315 nm) radiation often harms algal cells, while UV-A (315 to 400 nm) at moderate levels stimulates photosynthetic carbon fixation in both phytoplankton and macroalgae. In view of warming effects, increased temperatures have been shown to enhance photorepair of UV-damaged molecules, though it simultaneously enhances respiratory carbon loss. The net effects of ocean acidification on marine primary producers are therefore largely dependent on the photobiological conditions (light limitation, light or UV stress), as well as interactions with rising temperature and other variables such as altered nutrient availability. Hence, feedbacks between changing carbonate chemistry and solar radiation across the entire spectrum present complications to interpret and understand ocean acidification effects based on single-factor experiments.",45,2012,470,,167,189"Marr, AB; Arcese, P; Hochachka, WM; Reid, JM; Keller, LF",Interactive effects of environmental stress and inbreeding on reproductive traits in a wild bird population,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,Article,"1. Conservation biologists are concerned about the interactive effects of environmental stress and inbreeding because such interactions could affect the dynamics and extinction risk of small and isolated populations, but few studies have tested for these interactions in nature. 2. We used data from the long-term population study of song sparrows Melospiza melodia on Mandarte Island to examine the joint effects of inbreeding and environmental stress on four fitness traits that are known to be affected by the inbreeding level of adult birds: hatching success, laying date, male mating success and fledgling survival. 3. We found that inbreeding depression interacted with environmental stress to reduce hatching success in the nests of inbred females during periods of rain. 4. For laying date, we found equivocal support for an interaction between parental inbreeding and environmental stress. In this case, however, inbred females experienced less inbreeding depression in more stressful, cooler years. 5. For two other traits, we found no evidence that the strength of inbreeding depression varied with environmental stress. First, mated males fathered fewer nests per season if inbred or if the ratio of males to females in the population was high, but inbreeding depression did not depend on sex ratio. Second, fledglings survived poorly during rainy periods and if their father was inbred, but the effects of paternal inbreeding and rain did not interact. 6. Thus, even for a single species, interactions between the inbreeding level and environmental stress may not occur in all traits affected by inbreeding depression, and interactions that do occur will not always act synergistically to further decrease fitness.",45,2006,75,6,1406,1415"Cardinale, BJ; Hillebrand, H; Charles, DF",Geographic patterns of diversity in streams are predicted by a multivariate model of disturbance and productivity,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Article,"Univariate explanations of biodiversity have often failed to account for broad-scale patterns in species richness. As a result, increased attention has been paid to the development and testing of more synthetic multivariate hypotheses. One class of multivariate hypotheses, founded in successional diversity theory, predict that species richness is jointly influenced by periodic disturbances that create new niche opportunities in space or time, and the production of community biomass that speeds displacement of inferior by superior competitors. While the joint response of diversity to disturbance and productivity has gained support from theoretical and small-scale experimental studies, evidence that corresponding patterns of biodiversity occur broadly across natural systems is scarce. Using a data set that employed standardized methods to sample 85 streams throughout the mid-Atlantic United States of America, we show that biogeographical patterns of primary producer diversity in stream ecosystems are consistent with the predictions of a multivariate model that incorporates disturbance frequency and community biomass production as independent variables. Periphyton species richness is a concave-down function of disturbance frequency (mean no. floods year(-1)) and of biomass production (mu g of biomass accrual cm(-2) day(-1)), and an increasing function of their interaction. Changes in richness across the disturbance x productivity response surface can be related to several predicted life-history traits of the dominant species. Our findings complement prior studies by showing that multivariate models which consider interactive effects of community production and ecosystem disturbance are, in fact, candidate explanations of much broader patterns of richness in natural systems. Because multivariate models predict synergistic effects of ecological variables on species diversity, human activities - which are simultaneously altering both the disturbance regime and productivity of streams - could be influencing biodiversity more than previously anticipated.",45,2006,94,3,609,618"Seal, AN; Haig, T; Pratley, JE",Evaluation of putative allelochemicals in rice root exudates for their role in the suppression of arrowhead root growth,JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY,Article,"In previous studies, 15 putative allelopathic compounds detected in rice root exudates were quantified by GC/MS/MS. In this study, multiple regression analysis on these compounds determined that five selected phenolics, namely caffeic, p-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic, syringic, and p-coumaric acids, from rice exudates were best correlated with the observed allelopathic effect on arrowhead (Sagittaria montevidensis) root growth. Despite this positive association, determination of the phenolic acid dose-response curve established that the amount quantified in the exudates was much lower than the required threshold concentration for arrowhead inhibition. A similar dose-response curve resulted from a combination of all 15 quantified compounds. Significant differences between the amounts of trans-ferulic acid, abietic acid, and an indole also existed between allelopathic and non-allelopathic rice cultivars. The potential roles of these three compounds in rice allelopathy were examined by chemoassay. Overall, neither the addition of trans-ferulic acid nor 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid to the phenolic mix significantly contributed to phytotoxicity, although at higher concentrations, trans-ferulic acid appeared to act antagonistically to the phytotoxic effects of the phenolic mix. The addition of abietic acid also decreased the inhibitory effect of the phenolic mix. These studies indicate that the compounds quantified are not directly responsible for the observed allelopathic response. It is possible that the amount of phenolic acids may be indirectly related to the chemicals finally responsible for the observed allelopathic effect.",45,2004,30,8,1663,1678"Wilkinson, CR","Global change and coral reefs: Impacts on reefs, economies and human cultures",GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Article,"Coral reefs have reconstituted themselves after previous large sea-level variations, and climate changes. For the past 6000 years of unusually stable sea-level, reefs have grown without serious interruptions. During recent decades, however, new stresses threaten localized devastation of many reefs. A new period of global climate change is occurring, stimulated by anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases. Coral reefs will cope well with predicted sea-level rises of 4.5 cm per decade, but reef islands will not. Higher sea levels will provide corals with greater room for growth across reef flats, but there are no foreseeable mechanisms for reef island growth to keep pace with sea-level rise, therefore many low islands may ultimately become uninhabitable. Climate change will introduce localized variations in weather patterns, but changes to individual reefs cannot be predicted. Reefs on average should cope well with regional climate change, as they have coped with similar previous fluctuations. Air temperature increases of 0.2-0.3 degrees C/decade will induce slower increases in sea-surface temperatures, which may cause localized, or regional increases in coral bleaching. Changes in rainfall will impact on reefs near land masses. Likewise, increased storms and variations in El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) may stress some reefs, but not others. The greatest impact of climate change will be a synergistic enhancement of direct anthropogenic stresses (excessive sediment and pollution from the land; over-fishing, especially via destructive methods; mining of coral rock and sand; and engineering modifications), which currently cause most damage to coral reefs. Many of the world's reefs have been degraded and more will be damaged as anthropogenic impacts increase under the 'demophoric' increases in population (demos) and economic (phoric) activity. This biotic and habitat loss will result in severe economic and social losses.

The Brigalow Belt has experienced comparable rates of vegetation clearance over the past 50 years to areas of tropical deforestation. Economic factors were important during all phases of development, but the five regional drivers often acted in synergy. Environmental constraints played a significant role in slowing rates of change. Temporal trends of deforestation followed a sigmoidal curve, with initial slow change accelerating though the middle phases then slowing in recent times.

In the present review a series of laboratory experiments is reviewed in which rainbow trout (Oncouhynchus mykiss) were exposed to simulated global warming, a 2 degreesC increment superimposed upon the natural thermal regime, in the presence and absence of two common freshwater pollutants, ammonia and acidity (low pH). Simulated global warming had little effect on the growth and physiology of trout fed to satiation over much of the summer. However, in late summer, when ambient water temperature was at its highest, the addition of 2 degreesC caused a marked inhibition of appetite and growth, although this impact was not exacerbated by a reduction in food availability. In winter, +2 degreesC stimulated metabolism, appetite and growth by approximately 30-60%. Exposure of satiation-fed trout to low levels of pollutants produced unexpected results. Ammonia (NH3 + NH4+ = 70 mum) stimulated summer growth and energy conversion efficiency, whilst acidification (pH 5.2) increased appetite and growth but caused no disturbance of electrolyte balance. These pollutant effects were additive upon, but not synergistic with, the effects of +2 degreesC. The ability of the fish to acclimate to the experimental conditions was tested with acute lethal temperature and/or toxicant challenges. Fish exposed to +2 degreesC had a slightly (0.2-1.0 degreesC) but significantly higher lethal temperature than those exposed to ambient temperature when fed to satiation. However, there was no evidence of acclimation to either ammonia or low pH. It is concluded that the impact of global warming on freshwater fish will vary seasonally.

Yosemite National Park is one of the largest and best-known parks in the United States, harbouring significant cultural and ecological resources. Effective management of non-natives would be greatly assisted by information on their potential distribution that can be generated by predictive modelling techniques. Our goal was to identify key environmental factors that were correlated with the percent cover of non-native species and then develop a predictive model using the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Production technique. We performed a series of analyses using community-level data on species composition in 236 plots located throughout the park. A total of 41 non-native species were recorded which occurred in 23.7% of the plots. Plots with non-natives occurred most frequently at low- to mid-elevations, in flat areas with other herbaceous species. Based on the community-level results, we selected elevation, slope, and vegetation structure as inputs into the GARP model to predict the environmental niche of non-native species. Verification of results was performed using plot data reserved from the model, which calculated the correct prediction of non-native species occurrence as 76%.

Distribution maps of predicted occurrences will be used by management to: efficiently target monitoring of non-native species, prioritize control efforts according to the likelihood of non-native occurrences, and inform decisions relating to the management of non-native species in postfire environments.

I. Comparative analyses of Drosophila populations,EVOLUTION,Article,"We provide evidence from comparisons of populations of Drosophila that evolutionary correlations between longevity and stress resistance break down over the course of laboratory evolution. Using 15 distinct evolutionary regimes, we created 75 populations that were differentiated for early fecundity, longevity, starvation resistance, desiccation resistance, and developmental time. In earlier experiments, selection for postponed aging produced increases in stress resistance, whereas selection for increased stress resistance produced increases in longevity. Direct estimates of correlations also indicated an antagonistic relationship between early fecundity on one hand and longevity or stress resistance on the other. Laboratory evolution of extreme values of stress resistance, however, led to a breakdown in these evolutionary relationships. There was no evidence that these significant changes in correlation resulted from genotype-by-environment interactions or inbreeding. These findings suggest that correlations between functional characters are not necessarily durable features of a species, and that short-term evolutionary responses cannot be extrapolated reliably to longer-term evolutionary patterns.",43,2003,57,3,527,535"Bennington, CC; McGraw, JB",Environment-dependence of quantitative genetic parameters in Impatiens pallida,EVOLUTION,Article,"Population response to selection depends on the presence of additive genetic variance for traits under selection. When a population enters an alien environment, environment-induced changes in the expression of genetic variance may occur. These could have large effects on the response to selection. To investigate the environment-dependence of genetic variance, we conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment between two ecotypically differentiated populations of Impatiens pallida using the progeny of a standard mating design. The floodplain site was characterized by high water availability, moderate temperatures, and continuous dense stands of Impatiens. The hillside site was drier, with larger temperature extremes and supported only scattered patches of Impatiens with significantly lower seed production and earlier mortality. Estimates of heritability were low for each of the 13 trails measured in each population and site (range from 0-28%). Additive genetic variance for life-history traits tended to be larger than for morphological traits, but genetic variance in fitness was estimated to be not significantly different from zero in all cases. Significant heritability was detected in both populations for one trait (date of first cleistogamous flower) known to be closely related to fitness on the hillside. In general, heritability was reduced for populations when grown in the hillside site relative to the floodplain site, suggesting that stress acts to reduce the expression of genetic variance and the potential to respond to selection there. Consistent reductions in heritability associated with more stressful environments suggest that populations invading such sites may undergo little adaptive differentiation and be more prone to local extinction.",43,1996,50,3,1083,1097"Portner, HO",Integrating climate-related stressor effects on marine organisms: unifying principles linking molecule to ecosystem-level changes,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,Article,"Climate change effects on marine ecosystems involve various stressors, predominantly temperature, hypoxia and CO2, all of which may combine with further anthropogenic stressors such as pollutants. All life forms respond to these drivers, following potentially common principles, which are insufficiently understood. Specific understanding may be most advanced in animals where the concept of 'oxygen and capacity dependent thermal tolerance' (OCLTT) is an integrator of various effects, linking molecular to ecosystem levels of biological organisation. Recent studies confirm OCLTT involvement in the field, causing changes in species abundance, biogeographical ranges, phenology and species predominance. At the whole-animal level, performance capacity set by aerobic scope and energy budget, building on baseline energy turnover, links fitness (within a thermal window) and functioning at the ecosystem level. In variable environments like the intertidal zone, animals also exploit their capacity for passive tolerance. While presently the temperature signal appears predominant in the field, effects may well involve other stressors, acting synergistically by narrowing the aerobic OCLTT window. Recent findings support the OCLTT concept as a common physiological basis linking apparently disjunct effects of ocean warming, acidification and hypoxia in a so-called climate syndrome. In brief, warming-induced CO2 accumulation in body fluids links to the effects of ocean acidification mediated by the weak acid distribution of CO2. Temperature-induced hypoxemia links to the hypoxia sensitivity of thermal tolerance. Future work will need to develop proxies for the temperature-dependent effects of climate-related stressors and also identify the principles operative in organisms other than animals and their underlying mechanisms. Mechanism-based modelling efforts are then needed to develop reliable organism to ecosystem projections of future change.",42,2012,470,,273,290"Laurance, WF; Useche, DC",Environmental Synergisms and Extinctions of Tropical Species,CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,Review,"Environmental synergisms may pose the greatest threat to tropical biodiversity. Using recently updated data sets from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, we evaluated the incidence of perceived threats to all known mammal, bird, and amphibian species in tropical forests. Vulnerable, endangered, and extinct species were collectively far more likely to be imperiled by combinations of threats than expected by chance. Among 45 possible pairwise combinations of 10 different threats, 69%, 93%, and 71% were significantly more frequent than expected for threatened mammals, birds, and amphibians, respectively, even with a stringent Bonferroni-corrected probability value (p = 0.003). Based on this analysis, we identified five key environmental synergisms in the tropics and speculate on the existence of others. The most important involve interactions between habitat loss or alteration (from agriculture, urban sprawl, infrastructure, or logging) and other anthropogenic disturbances such as hunting, fire, exotic-species invasions, or pollution. Climatic change and emerging pathogens also can interact with other threats. We assert that environmental synergisms are more likely the norm than the exception for threatened species and ecosystems, can vary markedly in nature among geographic regions and taxa, and may be exceedingly difficult to predict in terms of their ultimate impacts.

The roles of the breeding partners in these adaptive decisions have, however, only rarely been studied. In blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) that breed in heterogenous Mediterranean habitats, nearby populations show up to 1-month differences in breeding time. This difference is adaptive as the optimal time for breeding varies by the same amount due to habitat characteristics. But which sex is determining this large difference in timing? We show here that the seasonal development of female reproductive activity (yolk precursor production) closely matches the local optimal breeding time in these two highly contrasted landscapes, while previous studies have demonstrated that male gonadal development does not. In accordance with this, quantitative genetic analyses reveal that timing for breeding is determined by the female only, with no evidence for an additive genetic male effect on laying date. Our results strongly suggest that the adaptive inter-population difference in the laying periods has been driven by females. The central role of females in the determination of breeding period needs to be included when studying how micro-evolutionary processes are affected by global climate change.",42,2009,23,1,172,179"Chaves, N; Escudero, JC; GutierrezMerino, C",Role of ecological variables in the seasonal variation of flavonoid content of Cistus ladanifer exudate,JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY,Article,"The leaves and photosynthetic stems of Cistus ladanifer, a plant that colonizes arid lands, secrete an exudate that shows a large seasonal variation in its flavonoid content. The maximum secretion of flavonoids in the exudate is produced during summer, increasing approximately three-to fourfold with respect to the secretion measured in spring. Summer is the season in which the plant suffers the greatest stress from environmental physical variables such as UV irradiation, high temperatures, and hydric stress. Studies were conducted in plants from several locations, which were selected considering daily UV irradiation (open or shaded areas), annual precipitation, and annual average maximum and minimum temperatures. Additional studies to control UV irradiation, drought, and temperature separately were performed with C. ladanifer plants growing in a glasshouse and in a culture room. The UV irradiation was found to be the major inducer of the enhanced flavonoid secretion during summer, because no significant increase of flavonoid secretion during summer was observed when the C. ladanifer plants in the field were covered with a Plexiglas box (total UV absorption below 380 nm). These results support an ecophysiological role of the flavonoids in the exudate to protect the plant against the damaging effects of UV irradiation. The culture room experiments confirmed this point and also showed that the induction of flavonoid secretion by UV irradiation is synergistically augmented by drought. The glasshouse and culture room experiments showed drought and high temperatures (between 30 degrees and 45 degrees C) to correlate with the summer increase of the more methylated flavonoids (kaempferols and 7-methylated apigenins) in the exudate. Because these more methylated flavonoids have higher hydropathy than the less methylated, these results suggest that the secretion of more methylated flavonoids is part of the defense mechanism of the plant against the hydric stress of summer.",42,1997,23,3,579,603"LEROI, AM; KIM, SB; ROSE, MR",THE EVOLUTION OF PHENOTYPIC LIFE-HISTORY TRADE-OFFS - AN EXPERIMENTAL-STUDY USING DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER,AMERICAN NATURALIST,Article,"Experimental manipulation of an organism's environment can reveal trade-offs among life-history and physiological traits such as fecundity and energy reserves. Such phenotypic trade-offs have been suggested to reflect evolutionary constraints. We test this idea by asking whether the selection responses of laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster can be predicted from a trade-off between fecundity and starvation resistance revealed by manipulating levels of dietary yeast. Fecundity and starvation resistance vary inversely over levels of dietary yeast: at high yeast levels, females have a high fecundity and low starvation resistance; at low yeast levels, females have a low fecundity and high starvation resistance. We examine the role of this trade-off in two independent sets of populations that have been selected for increased starvation resistance. We find that the joint selection responses of mean fecundity and starvation resistance cannot be predicted from the phenotypic trade-off in either the ancestral or control populations. This result implies that at least some of the genetic variation and covariation on which selection acted originated in physiological pathways not involved in the phenotypic trade-off. We also find that selection has altered the slope of the phenotypic trade-off such that, across yeast levels, the reproductive cost of a unit gain in starvation resistance is less in the starvation-resistant populations than in the controls.",42,1994,144,4,661,676"Harvey, BP; Gwynn-Jones, D; Moore, PJ",Meta-analysis reveals complex marine biological responses to the interactive effects of ocean acidification and warming,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Review,"Ocean acidification and warming are considered two of the greatest threats to marine biodiversity, yet the combined effect of these stressors on marine organisms remains largely unclear. Using a meta-analytical approach, we assessed the biological responses of marine organisms to the effects of ocean acidification and warming in isolation and combination.

Using a subset of orthogonal studies, we show that four of five of the biological responses measured (calcification, photosynthesis, reproduction, and survival, but not growth) interacted synergistically when warming and acidification were combined. The observed synergisms between interacting stressors suggest that care must be made in making inferences from single-stressor studies. Our findings clearly have implications for the development of adaptive management strategies particularly given that the frequency of stressors interacting in marine systems will be likely to intensify in the future.

We found disparate starting points for adaptation among laboratory populations derived from independently sampled wild populations for all traits. With respect to the subsequent evolutionary rate during laboratory adaptation, starvation resistance varied considerably among foundations such that the outcome of laboratory evolution is rather unpredictable for this particular trait, even in direction.

Conceptual models of the effects of wind disturbance have traditionally focused on the impacts of catastrophic disturbances and have painted a simple picture of how disturbance acts to maintain tree species diversity. These models ignore variation among species characteristics that could have important consequences for both resistance to and recovery from disturbance. 2 We integrated an empirically parameterized, mechanistic model of windstorm mortality (WINDSTORM) and a seed-mass-based dispersal and recruitment model into a spatially explicit, individual tree model of forest dynamics (SORTIE) in order to create simulated long-term 'experiments' designed to explore the sensitivity of forest composition and structure to species-specific resistance to and recovery from disturbance. 3 We found that species-specific variation in resistance to wind mortality interacted strongly with: (i) shade tolerance characteristics, (ii) the medium-term history of disturbances, (iii) the long-term average severity of the disturbance regime and (iv) seedbed substrate dynamics to influence tree population dynamics and successional trajectories. 4 We also examined how local and long-distance dispersal affect response to wind disturbance. Ignoring differences among local dispersal characteristics overestimates the importance of dispersal-limited species. Our results show that long-distance immigration maintains species coexistence only if the immigration rate is very high relative to local dispersal. Despite this, stand-scale models that ignore long-distance dispersal can underestimate population dynamics of dispersal-limited species. 5 Our results indicate that landscape-scale heterogeneity in structure and species composition in these forests is facilitated by synergisms between the stochastic nature of wind disturbance and complex interactions between species traits that govern: (i) resistance to disturbance, (ii) local dispersal and seedling establishment and (iii) competitive (i.e. growth/survival) traits that do not adhere to strict tradeoffs. 6 We conclude that wind disturbance has much more complex and variable effects on long-term dynamics of forest structure and composition than suggested by previous models. In particular, non-catastrophic disturbances can generate important variation in forest dynamics that can either lead to dominance by a single or small number of species, or facilitate species coexistence.",41,2006,94,5,1011,1026"Archer, MA; Phelan, JP; Beckman, KA; Rose, MR",Breakdown in correlations during laboratory evolution.

We demonstrate that the correlation between two fitness traits can change and that this change is due to sustained selection rather than a genotype-by-environment interaction or inbreeding depression.

Upon facing biotic stresses, plants orchestrate defence mechanisms via internal and external mechanisms that are mediated by signalling molecules such as salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, ethylene and various other volatile compounds. Although pathogen- and chemical-induced plant resistance has been studied extensively within the same plant compartment, the effects of above-ground (AG) insect-elicited plant defence on the resistance expression in roots and the below-ground (BG) microbial community are not well understood. 2. We assessed the effect of AG whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) attack on the elicitation of induced resistance against a leaf pathogen, Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. vesicatoria, a soil-borne pathogen, Ralstonia solanacearum, and on BG modifications of the rhizosphere microflora in peppers (Capsicum annuum). 3. Symptom development caused by the two bacterial pathogens on leaves and roots was significantly reduced in whitefly-exposed plants as compared to controls. A combined treatment with benzothiadiazole (BTH) and whitefly caused an additive effect on induced resistance, indicating that whitefly-induced plant defence can utilize salicylic acid (SA)-dependent signalling. To obtain further genetic evidence of this phenomenon, we evaluated the gene expression of Capsicum annuum pathogenesis-related protein (CaPR) 1, CaPR4, CaPR10 and Ca protease inhibitor II, and observed increased expression after BTH and/or whitefly treatment indicating that AG whitefly infestation elicited SA and jasmonic acid signalling in AG and BG. Since the expression pattern of PR genes in the roots differed, we assessed microbial diversity in plants treated with BTH and/or whitefly. 4. In addition to eliciting BG defence responses, a whitefly infestation of the leaves augmented the population of root-associated Gram-positive bacteria and fungi, which may have positively affected plant growth and induced systemic resistance. Whitefly feeding reduced plant size, which usually occurs as a consequence of the high costs of direct resistance induction. 5. Synthesis. Our results demonstrate that whitefly-induced resistance against bacterial pathogens can cross the AG-BG border and may cause further indirect benefits on future plant development, because it can positively affect the association or plant roots with putatively beneficial microorganisms.",40,2011,99,1,46,56"Bussotti, F","Functional leaf traits, plant communities and acclimation processes in relation to oxidative stress in trees: a critical overview",GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Review,"Tropospheric ozone exercises pressure on vegetation in combination with other oxidative factors such as strong sunlight, UV-B radiation, high temperatures and water shortage. The relationship established between these factors and the plants can be either antagonistic (cross-resistance) or synergistic. Response mechanisms are activated involving physiological, chemical and morphological features. Overall sensitivity (or resistance) is determined by the amount of total oxidative pressure in relation to the plant's physiological plasticity [i.e. its ability (within its own resilience potential) to alter its structure and functions in order to react to the oxidative pressure]. Within different populations of the same species, functional leaf traits (leaf area and thickness, leaf mass per area or specific leaf area, tissue thickness) may vary in relation to the extent that the plant succeeds in acclimating to ambient oxidative pressure. The behaviour of a tree in an oxidative environment can be interpreted by means of leaf structure analysis. Leaves presenting high tissue density (and thus low intercellular space content) display a high degree of acclimation to stressors, react little to environmental changes and are characterized by remarkable longevity. Leaves of this type also have a high photosynthesis capacity per surface unit (due to the N content per surface unit) and a high P-N/G(W) (or water use efficiency, WUE). Thus, they are able to support detoxification processes. These morphological traits are to be found in adult plants in late successional stands and, above all, in ambients that have already been subjected to oxidative pressure. However, in early successional species and during the dynamic stages of growth (e.g. in the renewal occurring along forest edges), it is the opposite leaf traits that prevail: low leaf density, high photosynthesis capacity per dry weight unit, low WUE, low leaf longevity. These traits make plants far more reactive to environmental changes (e.g. they exploit the light from sun flecks much more effectively), but enable them to achieve only a low degree of acclimation and a poor ability to support detoxification processes. Whereas adult forests display a high level of ecological resilience and have a relatively good tolerance of ozone, the renewal stages are (at least potentially) more vulnerable. In these environments, ozone can alter the competition among genotypes and favour more resistant ones. Among the sectors most at risk, we must include communities growing at the edge of their ecological range, for whom even a slight increase in oxidative pressure can trigger substantial degenerative processes.",40,2008,14,11,2727,2739"Deegan, LA; Bowen, JL; Drake, D; Fleeger, JW; Friedrichs, CT; Galvan, KA; Hobble, JE; Hopkinson, C; Johnson, DS; Johnson, JM; Lemay, LE; Miller, E; Peterson, BJ; Picard, C; Sheldon, S; Sutherland, M; Vallino, J; Warren, RS",Susceptibility of salt marshes to nutrient enrichment and predator removal,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,Article; Proceedings Paper,"Salt marsh ecosystems have been considered not susceptible to nitrogen overloading because early studies suggested that salt marshes adsorbed excess nutrients in plant growth. However, the possible effect of nutrient loading on species composition, and the combined effects of nutrients and altered species composition on structure and function, was largely ignored.

We altered whole salt marsh ecosystems (similar to 60 000 m(2)/treatment) by addition of nutrients in flooding waters and by reduction of a key predatory fish, the mummichog. We added nutrients (N and P; 15-fold increase over ambient conditions) directly to the flooding tide to mimic the way anthropogenic nutrients are delivered to marsh ecosystems. Despite the high concentrations (70 mmol N/L) achieved in the water column, our annual N loadings (15-60 g N.m(-2).yr(-1)) were an order of magnitude less than most plot-level fertilization experiments, yet we detected responses at several trophic levels.

The tropical Mexican State of Chiapas represents a good case study to analyze these interactions, due to the availability of official data, and its similarities to other tropical countries, in terms of environmental and socioeconomic characteristics. This study evaluates the relative importance of human-related and environmental variables in determining the distribution of the number of fires and area burned in the tropical State of Chiapas in years, of normal and extreme climatic conditions (non-El Nino vs. El Nino). We have searched for causal relationships among fire, environmental, and socioeconomic variables in Chiapas using path analysis. Results of this study show a major, importance of environmental variables in non-El Nino years, suggesting that the status of the vegetation was the main cause determining fire ignition and fire spread in these years. Contrarily, the observed trends in the El Nino period indicate that fire trends were mainly determined by the presence of ignition agents. In these El Nino years, vegetation is so severely water stressed that, when fire starts, all vegetation types burn, regardless of their flammability properties. The main vegetation types affected by fire in non-El Nino years were the most flammable ones, such as pine-oak communities, while rainforests burned the most in El Nino years. Altitude, pine-oak communities, and poverty levels played major roles in the arboreal fire incidence in non-El Nino years, whereas the distribution of pastures appeared as an important, variable determining arboreal fire incidence in El Nino years. When all fires were considered (affecting any vegetation layer), almost identical trends were observed, with the incorporation of a new variable influencing the area burned: density of infrastructure.

Because quantitative or small effect variation is considered to be the basis of evolutionary change, the claim that this variation shows mostly additive behavior has represented a serious obstacle for these hypotheses. The literature on classical phenotypic genetics as well as the contemporary counterpart of this work, developmental genetics, harbors a considerable wealth of information relevant to the issue of gene-character relationship. In particular, recent studies of gene interaction in Drosophila developmental genetics provide important insights into the structure and behavior of nonadditive gene action. It is proposed that the importance of these studies for population genetics lies in suggesting that the small-effect of at least some genetic variation can hide a potential for strong phenotypic effects which can be expressed through interlocus interactions within sets of functionally related loci. At the population level this genetic behavior implies that strong effects should become apparent in quantitative variation when the genotypic frequencies of the population are substantially disturbed. That at least some quantitative variation can show strong interaction effects with substantial disturbance of the population genotypic combinations is supported by results from quantitative genetic analyses of chromosome and inbred lines and long-term artificial selection on quantitative characters. An experiment comparing the genetic variance resulting from the same set of wild third-chromosomes in a wild type and mutant backgrounds revealed substantial amounts of unexpressed strong effects for a typical quantitative character in a wild population of Drosophila melanogaster.

Optimizing of a defensive secretion may on the one hand be achieved by gradual intervention of new secretion types (from one precursor) with increasing topical irritancy from primitive towards advanced taxa.

The two weakest competitors in our selection (Poa trivialis and Elytrigia repens) failed to benefit from flooding because direct losses from flooding exceeded gains from reduced competition. Accordingly, we found no trade-off between flooding tolerance and competitive ability indicating that floods affect strong and weak competitors equally, although some species tolerated floods better than others. Conclusions: Since competition is only temporarily weakened after disturbance, increased competitive ability relative to other species may provide a more effective strategy for persistence in flood-disturbed sites. Above-ground runners seem an important prerequisite for enhanced competitive ability of clonal species in flood-disturbed sites.",39,2004,15,3,305,314"Rasanen, K; Laurila, A; Merila, J","Geographic variation in acid stress tolerance of the moor frog, Rana arvalis. II. Adaptive maternal effects",EVOLUTION,Article,"The knowledge about the relative contributions of additive genetic and maternal effects, as well as the proximate determinants of maternal effects variation, on population differentiation remains elusive. Likewise, although embryonic performance is often an important component of fitness, it has been relatively little explored in respect to population differentiation. By conducting reciprocal crosses between an acid and a neutral origin population of moor frogs (Rana arvalis), we investigated the relative importance of additive genetic versus maternal effects in local adaptation to acidity in embryonic traits. Furthermore, by performing removal experiments of gelatinous egg capsules (jelly), we evaluated the possibility that differences in the extraembryonic membranes might explain the interpopulation variation in embryonic acid tolerance found in this and earlier studies. Embryos were raised from fertilization to hatching at three different pH levels (pH 4.0, 4.25, and 7.5) in the laboratory, and acid stress tolerance was measured in terms of embryonic survival, growth and development (i.e., size and age at hatching). The results show that the higher acid tolerance of acid population embryos (in terms of survival) was maternally determined, indicating adaptive maternal effects. The jelly removal experiment revealed that adaptation to acidity in embryonic survival may arise through variation related to structure/composition of the egg capsules. There was no evidence for a genetic basis in acid tolerance in sublethal effects, but additive and nonadditive genetic effects were found in embryonic growth and development, independently of treatment. The results indicate a role for maternal effects in local adaptation to acidity in amphibians, and genetically based differences in early life-histories among the populations.",39,2003,57,2,363,371"Mitchell, RJ; Zutter, BR; Gjerstad, DH; Glover, GR; Wood, CW",Competition among secondary-successional pine communities: A field study of effects and responses,ECOLOGY,Article,"Three common associates on secondary-successional pine sites (Andropogon virginicus, Liquidambar styraciflua, and Pinus taeda) were established in a field study in which a wide array of plant densities and species proportions were established using an additive series design. To mimic a specific competitive scenario (i.e., a managed early successional Pinus stand), Andropogon and Liquidambar were established a year prior to the establishment of Pinus. Competitive effect (the attenuation of resources) and competitive response (the growth of each species as a function of resource availability) were determined. Effect on soil water varied among species, depth of soil, and time. In the surface soil, soil water was largely influenced through non-uptake effects, while uptake effects were predominant in deeper portions of the solum. When competitor abundance was expressed on an aboveground biomass basis, rather than a density basis, species differences in effects on soil water were eliminated. Differences among the species in effects on soil water per unit leaf area or leaf biomass appear to be largely explained by differences in stomatal conductance. Predawn leaf-water potential was integrated over the season using a water-stress integral. Analysis of the water-stress integral suggested that Liquidambar and Andropogon both affected water available to Pious; however, only Liquidambar affected Andropogon, and only Andropogon affected seasonal water available to Liquidambar. Light was most strongly influenced by Liquidambar density; however, as Andropogon density increased, the effects of Liquidambar were reduced. Andropogon response was correlated with light but not with water stress or leaf nitrogen. This reflects high light requirements and high water use efficiency of C-4 plants. Liquidambar response was related to water stress and leaf nitrogen, perhaps reflecting the greater nitrogen requirements of hardwoods. Pinus response was significantly related to all three resources individually, i.e., water stress, light, and leaf nitrogen. Pinus response was better explained by a regression model that included light and water stress than by water stress or light alone. Pinus growth as a function of water stress and light indicated that communities dominated by Liquidambar largely reduced Pinus growth through reduction in light, while communities dominated by Andropogon reduced Pinus growth primarily by increasing water stress. In mixed communities of Liquidambar and Andropogon, pine growth was constrained more equally by light and water stress.",39,1999,80,3,857,872"Bouwhuis, S; Charmantier, A; Verhulst, S; Sheldon, BC",Individual variation in rates of senescence: natal origin effects and disposable soma in a wild bird population,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,Article,"P>1. Longitudinal studies of various vertebrate populations have recently demonstrated senescent declines in reproductive performance and/or survival probability with age to be almost ubiquitous in nature. Little is known, however, about the extent to which rates of senescence vary between individuals, and about causes or consequences of such variation. Quantifying these links in natural populations is important for understanding the constraints and adaptive processes underlying the evolution of senescence. 2. Here, we analyse breeding data from 1029 female great tits Parus major to quantify the effect of natal conditions and early life reproduction on rates of reproductive senescence, reproductive life span and lifetime reproductive success. 3. Although for locally born females we find no evidence that natal conditions influence rates of reproductive senescence, we show that immigrant females suffer from faster rates of senescence than locally born females, and that this difference contributes to immigrants having a lower lifetime reproductive success. 4. Additionally, and independently, we find rates of reproductive senescence to increase with rates of early life reproduction, as predicted by the disposable soma hypothesis. Despite accelerated senescence late in life, high early life reproduction is, however, positively associated with lifetime reproductive success across individuals. 5. Female immigrant status and early life reproduction do not relate to reproductive life span. 6. We thus show that both immigration into our population, and high levels of early life reproduction, are associated with reduced late life reproductive performance in female great tits, but that fitness can be increased by high levels of early life reproduction at the expense of accelerated reproductive senescence. These results suggest disposable soma to be a likely mechanism underlying senescence in these birds, and encourage further study of the genetic basis (i.e. antagonistic pleiotropy) of such an early vs. late life trade-off.",38,2010,79,6,1251,1261"Fordham, DA; Brook, BW",Why tropical island endemics are acutely susceptible to global change,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,Article,"Tropical islands are species foundries, formed either as a by-product of volcanism, when previously submerged seabed is thrust upwards by tectonics, or when a peninsula is isolated by rising sea level. After colonisation, the geographical isolation and niche vacancies provide the competitive impetus for an evolutionary radiation of distinct species-island endemics. Yet the very attributes which promote speciation in evolutionary time also leave island endemics highly vulnerable to recent and rapid impacts by modern people. Indeed, the majority of documented human-driven extinctions have been exacted upon island endemics. The causes include over-exploitation, invasive species brought by people and destruction of island's naturally constrained habitats. Imminent threats include inundation by rising sea levels and other adaptive pressures related to anthropogenic global warming. We review recent work which underscores the susceptibility of island endemics to the drivers of global change, and suggest a methodological framework under which, we argue, the science and mitigation of island extinctions can be most productively advanced.",38,2010,19,2,329,342"Norry, FM; Dahlgaard, J; Loeschcke, V",Quantitative trait loci affecting knockdown resistance to high temperature in Drosophila melanogaster,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,Article,"Knockdown resistance to high temperature is an ecologically important trait in small insects. A composite interval mapping was performed on the two major autosomes of Drosophila melanogaster to search for quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting knockdown resistance to high temperature (KRHT). Two dramatically divergent lines from geographically different thermal environments were artificially selected on KRHT. These lines were crossed to produce two backcross (BC) populations. Each BC was analysed for 200 males with 18 marker loci on chromosomes 2 and 3. Three X-linked markers were used to test for X-linked QTL in an exploratory way. The largest estimate of autosome additive effects was found in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 2, accounting for 19.26% (BC to the low line) and 29.15% (BC to the high line) of the phenotypic variance in BC populations, but it could represent multiple closely linked QTL. Complete dominance was apparent for three QTL on chromosome 3, where heat-shock genes are concentrated. Exploratory analysis of chromosome X indicated a substantial contribution of this chromosome to KRHT. The results show that a large-effect QTL with dominant gene action maps on the right arm of chromosome 3.

For wing traits, heritabilities were relatively lower in the stressful environment, while heritabilities for bristle traits were not influenced by conditions.

J. Ewens, following G. R. Price, has stressed that Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection about the increase in mean fitness is of general validity without any restrictive assumptions on the mating system, the fitness parameters, or the numbers of loci and alleles involved, but that it concerns only a partial change in mean fitness, This partial change is obtained by replacing the actual genotypic fitnesses by the corresponding additive genetic values and by keeping these values fixed in the change of the mean with respect to changes in genotype frequencies. We propose an alternate interpretation for this partial change which uses partial changes in genotype frequencies directly consequent on changes in gene frequencies, the fitness parameters being kept constant. We argue that this interpretation agrees more closely with Fisher's own explanations. Moreover, this approach leads to a decomposition for the total change in mean fitness which explains, unifies, and extends previous decompositions, We consider a wide range of models, from discrete-time selection models with nonoverlapping generations to continuous-time models with overlapping generations and age effects on viability and fecundity, which is the original framework for Fisher's fundamental theorem.

Whether corals can adapt to increasing temperatures over the course of generations will depend in part on heritable variation in thermal physiology and dispersal potential, which may serve as the raw material for natural selection. To investigate whether such variation exists in coral populations, and build a framework for identifying the coral-specific genetic factors involved, we performed controlled crosses between 3 genetically distinct colonies of the branching coral Acropora millepora. We compared the families of larvae (which in this species naturally lack symbionts) for several physiological traits, and observed between-family differences in nearly every case. Using larvae cultured at standard and elevated temperatures, we measured the developmental decrease in protein content and the expression of candidate heat response genes. We used an in vivo assay for mitochondrial enzyme activity to evaluate the metabolic response to temperature changes in individual larvae. We also compared the responsiveness of larvae from different families to a natural settlement cue to gain insights into long-range dispersal potential. Partitioning the components of total phenotypic variance confirmed the existence of additive genetic effects for settlement rates and beta gamma-crystallin expression, while variance in mitochondrial Q(10) and the expression of actin and Hsp16 were driven by non-additive effects. The phenotypic variance observed among the small number of families analyzed here suggests the existence of considerable heritable variation in natural coral populations, which supports the possibility of effective adaptive responses to climate change.",37,2009,392,,81,92"Thrush, SF; Hewitt, JE; Hickey, CW; Kelly, S",Multiple stressor effects identified from species abundance distributions: Interactions between urban contaminants and species habitat relationships,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,Article,"The potential for stressors to interact or elicit different responses depending on ecological setting can confound the use of contaminant guidelines or predictions from laboratory-based ecotoxicological studies. However, predicting and identifying multiple stressor effects is challenging because of the wide range of treatment combinations needed for laboratory experiments and the difficulty of conducting field experiments across a range of conditions that may influence stress responses. In this study we analyse density responses apparent in the natural populations of 46 macrofaunal taxa to stressors representing habitat requirements (sediment particle size), food (sediment organic content) and heavy metal contamination (copper, zinc and lead). Simple responses to either a single stressor or stressors acting additively were less apparent in our regression-based models than multiplicative effects. We also investigated whether species that exhibited a unimodal abundance distribution in response to a habitat factor were more likely to exhibit differential responses to contaminants than species that exhibited monotonic responses to habitat factors. This proved to be the case, although not all unimodal abundance distributions were related to differential responses. The results of this study suggest that regression analysis, together with well-designed, large-scale, field surveys, offer a good method for describing and predicting effects of multiple stressors and helping to both target experiments and scale-up their results.

In this study, we test inbreeding depression in multiple replicates of inbred when compared with non-inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster under different temperature conditions. Egg-to-adult viability, developmental time and sex ratio of emerging adults are studied under low, intermediate and high temperatures under laboratory as well as semi-natural conditions. The results show inbreeding depression for egg-to-adult viability. The level of inbreeding depression is highly dependent on test temperature and is observed only at low and high temperatures. Inbreeding did not affect the developmental time or the sex ratio of emerging adults. However, temperature affected the sex ratio with more females relative to males emerging at low temperatures, suggesting that selection against males in pre-adult life stages is stronger at low temperatures. The coefficient of variation (CV) of egg-to-adult viability within and among lines is higher for inbred flies and generally increases at stressful temperatures.

Within the study area geese were feeding on pastures, which together with cereals were the main crop types. Apart from wind turbines a variety of potentially disturbing landscape elements was present, e.g., high-power lines, windbreaks, roads and settlements. Patterns of field use were assessed by measuring goose dropping densities along transects perpendicular to wind farms (with turbines in clusters and in lines) and other landscape elements. Local effects were expressed in terms of 'avoidance distance', i.e., the distance from a given landscape element to the point at which 50% of maximal dropping density was reached. The spatial distribution of landscape elements within an eight km radius from the goose roost was determined from aerial photographs. The area occupied by various elements, together with the adjacent zones which were not available to geese due to their associated avoidance distances, were quantified using Geographic Information System (GIS). The avoidance distance of wind farms with turbines in lines and in clusters were ca 100 m and ca 200 m, respectively. Geese did not enter the area between turbines within the cluster. At the landscape level, the combined effect of physical elements other than wind turbines caused an effective loss of 68% of the total field area (40 km(2)). Wind turbines caused an additional loss of 4% of the field area. However, of the remaining area available to geese (13 km(2)), wind turbines caused a loss of 13% of the total area. The habitat loss per turbine was higher for the wind farm with turbines arranged in a large cluster than for wind farms with turbines in small clusters or lines. This difference was mainly due to the fact that wind farms in small clusters or with a linear layout were generally placed close to roads or other elements with existing associated avoidance zones, whereas the large cluster was placed in the open farmland area. The avoidance zones associated with physical elements in the landscape do not take into account possible synergistic effects and, hence, actual field areas affected are likely to be minimum estimates. Implications of these findings for planning of wind farms in areas of conservation interest to geese are discussed.",37,2000,15,8,755,764"Messina, FJ; Richards, JH; McArthur, ED",Variable responses of insects to hybrid versus parental sagebrush in common gardens,OECOLOGIA,Article,"Both ecological and genetic mechanisms have been proposed to explain patterns of herbivore attack on interspecific plant hybrids, but distinguishing among them can be difficult in natural hybrid zones. We per formed a common-garden experiment to evaluate four genetic hypotheses: dominance, additivity, elevated hybrid susceptibility, and elevated hybrid resistance. Censuses and cage experiments were used to compare insect responses to basin big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata spp. tridentata), mountain big sagebrush (A. t. vaseyana), and their F-2 progeny. After two growing seasons, hybrid shrubs resembled mountain big sagenbrush in size, but were more similar to basin big sagebrush in flower production. Censuses of naturally colonizing insects (the gall midge Rhopalomyia obovata, the bagworm moth Apterona helix, and the aphid Obtusciauda coweni) tended to support the dominance hypothesis: if the insect clearly discriminated between the two parents, its frequency on hybrids closely resembled that on one of the parents. Moreover, colonization of hybrids in all three cases suggested a dominance deviation toward the susceptible parent rather than toward the resistant parent. In contrast to the censuses, cage experiments involving two insects supported the hybrid-susceptibility hypothesis; both survival and growth of the grasshopper Melanoplus sanguinipes and growth of the leaf beetle Trirhabda pilosa were higher on hybrid shrubs than on either parent. Because many secondary compounds have been determined to occur at intermediate concentrations in F-2 shrubs, dominance for susceptibility may indicate that insects respond to plant traits (e.g., oviposition stimulants and deterrents) in a threshold manner. Mechanisms underlying increased hybrid susceptibility are less clear, but our experimental design makes environmental explanations (e.g., the plant-stress hypothesis) unlikely. Although we eliminated several confounding factors, our results agree with the conclusion from natural hybrid zones that insect responses to hybrid plants are likely to be idiosyncratic; even congeneric species did not respond similarly to hybrid and parental plants.",37,1996,107,4,513,521"DESTEVEN, D; KLINE, J; MATTHIAE, PE",LONG-TERM CHANGES IN A WISCONSIN FAGUS-ACER FOREST IN RELATION TO GLAZE STORM DISTURBANCE,JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE,Article,"Changes in the composition of a Fagus-Acer (Beech-Sugar maple) forest in southeastern Wisconsin over a 16-yr period from 1971 to 1987 are analyzed in relation to a severe glaze (ice) storm disturbance occurring within the census period. Landscape topography created 'windward' and 'leeward' forest aspects with respect to storm severity, which resulted in greater canopy opening on the windward aspect. In the tree stratum, most species remained stable in density and most of the common species increased in basal area into larger size classes. However, Fagus grandifolia, Ulmus rubra, and the small tree Ostrya virginiana suffered net losses that suggest synergistic effects between glaze storm disturbance and other factors upon tree mortality. In the sapling stratum, canopy opening strongly promoted release of shade-tolerant Acer saccharum. On the windward forest aspect, sapling densities of less shade-tolerant species also increased, in contrast to the absence of such increases on the leeward forest aspect. In the shrub (regeneration) stratum, species responses were heterogeneous. Regeneration of most species increased over the 16-yr period, and some less shade-tolerant species showed increased regeneration differentially on the windward forest aspect. Overall, disturbance appears to have accelerated forest succession toward increased dominance by A. saccharum and persistence of both Fagus and Tilia americana through their capacities for root sprouting. However, forest succession was retarded somewhat on the windward aspect through increased recruitment of less-shade tolerant species.

Here we evaluate the common perception that stress increases selection. We consider various conceptual paradigms for thinking about selection and stress, and then review the empirical data.

We established experimental communities of varying intraspecific genetic diversity, using genotypes of eight species propagated from clonal material of individuals derived from a small (100-m(2)) limestone grassland community, and tested whether genetic diversity (one, four, and eight genotypes per species) influenced community composition and annual aboveground productivity across communities of one, four, and eight species. Eight-species communities were represented by common grass, sedge, and forb species, and four- and one-species communities were represented by four graminoids and the dominant grass Festuca ovina, respectively. After three years of community development, there was a marginal increase of species diversity with increased genetic diversity in four- and eight-species communities, and genetic diversity altered the performance of genotypes in monospecific communities of F. ovina. However, shifts in composition from genetic diversity were not sufficient to alter patterns of community productivity. Neighborhood models describing pairwise interactions between species indicated that genetic diversity decreased the intensity of competition between species in four-species mixtures, thereby promoting competitive equivalency and enhancing species equitability. In F. ovina monocultures, neighborhood models revealed both synergistic and antagonistic interactions between genotypes that were reduced in intensity on more stressful shallow soils. Although the dependence of F. ovina genotype performance on neighborhood genetic composition did not influence total productivity, such dependence was sufficient to uncouple genotype performance in genetic mixtures and monocultures. Our results point to an important connection between local genetic diversity and species diversity in this species-rich ecosystem but suggest that such community-level dependence on genetic diversity may not feedback to ecosystem productivity.",36,2010,91,8,2272,2283"Pajares, JA; Alvarez, G; Ibeas, F; Gallego, D; Hall, DR; Farman, DI","Identification and Field Activity of a Male-Produced Aggregation Pheromone in the Pine Sawyer Beetle, Monochamus galloprovincialis",JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY,Article,"The pine sawyer beetle, Monochamus galloprovincialis, is a pest of pine trees in Europe and North Africa. Previously considered a secondary pest of stressed and dying trees, it is now receiving considerable attention as a vector of the pine wood nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, the causal agent of a lethal wilting disease in susceptible species of pines. Adult beetles are attracted to traps baited with a kairomone blend consisting of a host volatile, alpha-pinene, and two bark beetle pheromone components, ipsenol and 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol. More recently it has been shown that mature male M. galloprovincialis produce a pheromone that attracts mature females in a laboratory bioassay. Here, volatiles were collected from mature male and female M. galloprovincialis, and a compound produced specifically by mature males was identified as 2-undecyloxy-1-ethanol from its gas chromatographic retention times, its mass spectrum, and by comparison with synthetic standards. The naturally-derived and synthetic compounds elicited electroantennographic responses from both females and males. Sealed polyethylene vials and polyethylene sachets were shown to be effective dispensers with zero-order release, the latter giving a higher release rate than the former. In two field tests, multiple-funnel traps baited with synthetic 2-undecyloxy-1-ethanol caught both female and male M. galloprovincialis, with higher catches at the higher release rate.

This is the first example of a sex-specific compound in the cerambycid subfamily Lamiinae with significant behavioral activity in the field at a range sufficient to make it a useful trap bait.

Both T testudinum and H. wrightii were highly thermal tolerant, demonstrating their tropical affinities and potential to adapt to high temperatures, While plants survived the 38 d temperature treatments, there was a clear thermal threshold above 33 degrees C where T testudinum growth declined and leaf quantum efficiencies (Fv/Fm) fell below 0.7. At this threshold temperature, H. wrightii maintained shoot densities and leaf quantum efficiencies.

We conducted a 2x2 manipulative food addition plus natural predator reduction experiment on song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) over three consecutive breeding seasons. Food and predators together affected partial clutch or brood loss, nest survival (total clutch or brood loss) and annual reproductive success. When combined, our two treatments reduced partial losses by more than expected if the effects of food and predators were independent and additive. Food and predators also interacted in their effects on nest survival since food addition significantly reduced the rate of nest predation. While annual reproductive success was highly correlated with nest predation (r(2)=0.71) the strength of this relationship was reinforced by the indirect effects of food addition on nest predation. A stepwise multiple regression showed that the residual variation in annual reproductive success was explained by food effects on the total number of eggs laid over the season and the combined effects of food and predators on partial losses noted above. We conclude that annual reproductive success in song sparrows is a function of both food-restricted production and predator-induced loss and indirect food and predator effects on both clutch and brood loss. We highlight the parallels between our results and those from a comparable bi-factorial experiment on mammals because we suspect combined food and predator effects are likely the norm in both birds and mammals.",36,2006,147,4,632,640"Casagrandi, R; Gatto, M","Habitat destruction, environmental catastrophes, and metapopulation extinction",THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY,Article,"The extinction process of fragmented populations, characterized by a small number of conspecifics inhabiting each patch, is heavily affected by natural and human disturbance. To evaluate the risk of extinction we consider a network of identical patches connected by passive or active dispersal and hosting a finite, discrete number of individuals. We discuss three types of disturbance affecting the metapopulation: permanent loss of habitat patches, erosion of existing patches, and random catastrophes that wipe out the entire population of a patch. Starting from an infinite-dimensional Markov model that fully accounts for demographic stochasticity, we reduce it to finite dimension via moment closure with negative-binomial approximation. The compact models obtained in this way account for the dynamics of the fraction of empty patches, the average number of individuals in occupied patches, and the variance of their distribution. After comparing the performance of these compact models with that of the infinite-dimensional model in the case of no disturbances, we then proceed to computing persistence-extinction boundaries as bifurcation lines of the compact models in the space of demographic and disturbance parameters. We consider bifurcations with respect to demographic and environmental parameters and contrast our results with those of previous theories. We find out that environmental catastrophes increase the risk of extinction for both frequent and infrequent dispersers, while the random loss of patches has a much larger influence on frequent dispersers. This influence can be counterbalanced by active dispersal. Local erosion of habitat fragments has a larger influence on infrequent than on frequent dispersers. We finally discuss the important synergistic effects of disturbances acting simultaneously.

Improvements in intercrop yields may be achieved through an understanding of yield advantages due to above-ground or below-ground interactions. 2. Forage maize and two morphologically contrasting cultivars of pea (leafy cv. Bohatyr and semi-leafless cv. Grafila) were grown alone and in additive mixtures, under two contrasting levels of soil moisture (+/- water stress). 3. The mechanism of competition between maize and pea was studied by separating the effects of root competition and shoot competition, using soil and aerial partitions. Plants were grown in rectangular tanks in a glasshouse. 4. Leafy pea cv. Bohatyr was as competitive as maize, both below-ground and above-ground, whereas semi-leafless pea cv. Grafila was less competitive than maize or pea cv. Bohatyr. The greater competitive ability of the leafy pea, both above- and below-ground, was probably due to its greater growth rate, associated with its greater leaf area. 5. The competitive ability of maize, relative to peas, was considerably reduced by water stress. Both the root and shoot competitive abilities of pea were greater under water stress, compared with those of maize. 6. Relative yield total (RYT) values were significantly greater when maize and pea were subjected to shoot competition only (RYT = 1.76) than when subjected to root competition (RYT = 1.17) or when subjected to both shoot and root competition (RYT = 1.13). This reflects the fact that the effects of root competition were greater than those of shoot competition. 7. Root competition decreased the shoot dry weights, plant height and leaf area of both maize and pea, whereas shoot competition had no significant effect on these attributes, indicating that soil resources, i.e. mineral nutrients and water, were more limiting than light.",36,2001,38,1,137,145"Gadallah, MAA","Effects of indole-3-acetic acid and zinc on the growth, osmotic potential and soluble carbon and nitrogen components of soybean plants growing under water deficit",JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS,Article,"Three-week old soybean (Glycine max) plants were subjected to a factorial combination of four regimes of soil matric water potential (psi(m) = - 0. 03, - 0.5, - 1.0 and - 1.5 MPa), two levels of supplementary Zn (O and 20 mgl(-1)) and two levels of foliar IAA application (O and 10 mgl(-1)). Under control conditions (no Zn, no IAA), increasing soil drying progressively retarded shoot and root growth (length and dry mass production), reduced leaf relative water content (RWC) and decreased the contents of chlorophyll (Chl) and shoot soluble sugars (SS), but increased soluble sugar content of roots and lowered osmotic water potential of shoots and roots (osmotic adjustment). Total free amino acid (TAA) content increased in shoots but decreased in roots whereas contents of soluble proteins (SP) decreased in shoots and roots. The effect of water stress was statistically significant (p < 0.05) and had a major effect las indicated by eta(2) values) on leaf RWC, shoot and root dry masses and osmo tic potential. Supplementary Zn improved root growth at all levels of stress and shoot growth under severe stress. Improvement of growth was positively correlated with the internal tissue Zn concentrations (r - 0.91 and 0.86 for shoot and 0.94 and 0.82 for root length and dry mass respectively). Exogenous IAA raised (p < 0.05) RWC, Chi, DM (slightly), root SS, and SP, whereas shoot TAA was lowered. Effects on root TAA and shoot SS were more complex: they were lowered at zero stress and raised under severe stress. IAA and Zn in combination had additive effects on Chi, growth and osmotic potential, but their combined effects on SP and TAA were more complex. It is concluded that the treatment of soybean plants grown under conditions of low soil water potentials and Zn deficiency with Zn and IAA solutions counteracted the deleterious effects of stress, especially at high stress levels, and helped stressed plants to grow successfully under these adverse unfavourable conditions.

Much of this relevance may depend on how animals cope with plant resources at different spatial scales. However, little is known about how and why different interactions perform at different scales in the same environmental setting. In this study we assess the spatial scales at which two plant-animal interactions operate and disentangle the environmental factors (plant resource availability vs. habitat structure) underpinning these operational scales. We studied two interactions with opposite (mutualistic vs. antagonistic) ecological effects on fleshy-fruited trees, frugivory and seed dispersal by birds, and the later predation by rodents on bird-dispersed seeds. Employing a standardized sampling, we covered three temperate ecosystems hosting structurally similar plant-frugivore-seed predator systems: Cantabrian forest, Mediterranean shrubland, and Patagonian forest. We sampled habitat structure (tree and understory covers), fleshy-fruit abundance, bird-dispersed seed occurrence, frugivorous bird abundance, and seed predation rate, along 15002500 m transects. Using a spatially explicit approach, we broke down the predictable spatial patterns of bird abundance and seed predation rate into patchiness at three consecutive spatial scales (broad, intermediate, and fine). The degree of patchiness and the allocation of spatial variability at different scales suggested a hierarchically nested structure in frugivory and seed predation, but a larger operational scale in seed predation than in frugivory. Scale-specific spatial distributions were explained by the response of animals to plant resource availability and habitat structure. Birds tracked fruits at large spatial scales in all systems and, within some systems, even across consecutive scales. Seed predation distribution was more responsive to habitat features than to resource availability. The reinforcement of resource tracking patterns across scales sometimes occurred simultaneously with the dilution of habitat effects, suggesting that scale dependence may emerge from trade-offs between resource acquisition and the effects of other factors, such as predation risk, on interacting animals. Our findings suggest that scale dependence in frugivory and seed predation may affect the balance of demographic effects of these interactions in plant populations. Moreover, the consistency of frugivory patterns within and across spatial scales may condition the redundancy of seed dispersal as an ecosystem function.",35,2011,81,1,103,121"Ayroles, JF; Hughes, KA; Rowe, KC; Reedy, MM; Rodriguez-Zas, SL; Drnevich, JM; Caceres, CE; Paige, KN","A Genomewide Assessment of Inbreeding Depression: Gene Number, Function, and Mode of Action",CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,Article,"Although the genetic basis of inbreeding depression is still being debated, most fitness effects are thought to be the result of increased homozygosity for recessive or partially recessive deleterious alleles rather than the loss of overdominant genes. It is unknown how many loci are associated with inbreeding depression, the genes or gene pathways involved, or their mode of action. To uncover genes associated with variation in fitness following inbreeding, we generated a set of inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster for which only the third chromosome varied among lines and measured male competitive reproductive success among these lines to estimate inbreeding depression. Male competitive reproductive success for different lines validated our prediction that equally inbred lines show variation in inbreeding depression. To begin to assess the molecular basis of inbreeding depression for male competitive reproductive success, we detected variation in whole-genome gene expression across these inbred lines with commercially available high-density oligonucleotide microarrays. A total of 567 genes were differentially expressed among these inbred lines, indicating that inbreeding directly or indirectly affects a large number of genes: genes that are disproportionately involved in metabolism, stress and defense responses. Subsequently, we generated a set of outbred lines by crossing the highest inbreeding depression lines to each other and contrasted gene expression between parental inbred lines and F(1) hybrids with transcript abundance as a quantitative phenotype to determine the mode of action of the genes associated with inbreeding depression. Although our results indicated that approximately 75% of all genes involved in inbreeding depression were additive, partially additive, or dominant, about 25% of all genes expressed patterns of overdominance. These results should be viewed with caution given that they may be confounded by issues of statistical inference or associative overdominance.",35,2009,23,4,920,930"Jonsson, M; Wardle, DA",Context dependency of litter-mixing effects on decomposition and nutrient release across a long-term chronosequence,OIKOS,Article,"Litter decomposition is an important driver of terrestrial systems, and factors that determine decomposition rate for individual litter species have been widely studied. Fewer studies have explored the factors that regulate how mixing litters of multiple species affects litter decomposition and nutrient dynamics, and only a handful of studies have investigated how litter-mixing effects may differ among different habitats or ecosystems, or how they respond to environmental gradients. We used a well-established retrogressive chronosequence involving thirty lake islands in northern Sweden in which time since fire disturbance increases with decreasing island size; smaller islands therefore have reduced rates of aboveground and belowground ecosystem processes. On each of these islands we utilized plots with and without the long-term experimental removal of shrubs. Litters from the six most common plant species on the islands were prepared in single-, three- and six-species litterbags, and placed on both the shrub-removal and non-removal plots on each island to decompose for one year. We found significant non-additive effects of litter mixing on litter decomposition rates, on final litter N and P concentrations, and on litter N loss, but these non-additive effects varied both in direction and magnitude with changed number of species, and even among litter mixtures with the same number of species. Further, the magnitude of non-additive effects of litter mixing on both litter decomposition and nutrient dynamics was significantly influenced by both island size and the interaction between island size and shrub-removal treatment. When shrubs were present, there was a U-shaped relationship between these non-additive effects and island size, while the relationship was positive when shrubs were removed. Hence, our results support previous findings that litter mixing may produce non-additive effects on litter decomposition and nutrient dynamics, and that these effects tend to be idiosyncratic due to the importance of effects of individual species in the mixture. Most importantly, our results show that non-additive litter-mixing effects change greatly across environmental gradients, meaning that the biotic and abiotic characteristics of an ecosystem can be a powerful driver of the magnitude and even the direction of litter-mixing effects on ecosystem processes.",35,2008,117,11,1674,1682"Burger, JMS; Kolss, M; Pont, J; Kawecki, TJ",Learning ability and longevity: A symmetrical evolutionary trade-off in Drosophila,EVOLUTION,Article,"Learning ability can be substantially improved by artificial selection in animals ranging from Drosophila to rats. Thus these species have not used their evolutionary potential with respect to learning ability, despite intuitively expected and experimentally demonstrated adaptive advantages of learning. This suggests that learning is costly, but this notion has rarely been tested. Here we report correlated responses of life-history traits to selection for improved learning in Drosophila melanogaster. Replicate populations selected for improved learning lived on average 15% shorter than the corresponding unselected control populations. They also showed a minor reduction in fecundity late in life and possibly a minor increase in dry adult mass. Selection for improved learning had no effect on egg-to-adult viability, development rate, or desiccation resistance. Because shortened longevity was the strongest correlated response to selection for improved learning, we also measured learning ability in another set of replicate populations that had been selected for extended longevity. In a classical olfactory conditioning assay, these long-lived flies showed an almost 40% reduction in learning ability early in life. This effect disappeared with age.

I investigated patterns of actuarial senescence in a sample of 169 species of birds in relation to latitude and migration, by analysing longevity records adjusted for sampling effort, survival rate and body mass. Senescence might decrease at low latitudes because of elevated adult survival rates and generally slow life histories. Alternatively, the rate of senescence might increase at low latitudes because of the greater impact of biological interactions such as parasitism, predation and competition on fitness through differential effects of age-specific mortality (e.g. because immunologically naive young individuals and immuno-senescent old individuals might die more frequently than individuals belonging to intermediate age classes). Bird migration entails extensive exercise twice annually, with migrants spending more time in benign environments with little abiotic mortality than residents, migrants having higher adult survival rate and lower annual fecundity than residents, and migrants suffering more from the consequences of oxidative stress than residents. The rate of senescence increased with latitude, as expected because of slow life histories at low latitudes. Independently, rate of senescence decreased with increasing migration distance. These findings were robust to control for potentially confounding effects of body mass, age of first reproduction and phenotypic similarity among species because of common descent.",35,2007,20,2,750,757"Martorell, C; Peters, EM",The measurement of chronic disturbance and its effects on the threatened cactus Mammillaria pectinifera,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,Article,"Measuring how anthropogenic disturbance affects biological systems is crucial for conservation and management. However, it is often difficult to quantify disturbance when it occurs in a slow, long-lasting - or chronic - fashion. Because various human activities influence gradually an area, chronic disturbance must be measured on a continuous scale that accounts for different sources of disturbance. Here we propose a method to develop multimetric indices for chronic disturbance. The approach is exemplified by considering the effects of disturbance on the threatened cactus Mammillaria pectinifera. Fourteen indicators of three agents of disturbance (human activities, livestock raising and land degradation) were measured in 10 populations of M. pectinifiera, and summarised through principal components analysis (PCA). An index for each agent was also developed. M. pectinifera achieved maximum density at intermediate values of the first PCA axis, which was related to disturbance intensity. Assessing only both extremes of the disturbance gradient, where density is low, would erroneously suggest that disturbance has no effect on this plant. The different disturbance agents act synergistically on M. pectinifera, and their combined effects are detrimental. Land degradation reduces plant density, while livestock enhances it. However, overgrazing promotes degradation, so maintaining appropriate livestock levels is critical for management. Our method allowed us to identify which agents have more impact on threatened species, and sets the basis to manage disturbance agents in a way compatible with conservation. The method proposed here can be easily modified for its use in other environments and to account for different forms of anthropogenic disturbance. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

We determined height increment, above-ground biomass production, leaf size, specific leaf weight and the content of the alkaloids apparicine, A2, isovoacangine, tubotaiwine and tubotaiwine-N-oxide. The effects of major controlling factors such as light, water and nutrient supply could be directly correlated with growth and were largely independent of each other. In contrast, leaf-alkaloid contents were influenced by interdependencies among the main factors and individually affected in a synergistic or antagonistic manner which deviated from the effects on growth. The following general trends could be identified with respect to the quantitatively predominant alkaloids apparicine, tubotaiwine and isovoacangine. Increasing nutrient supply had a positive effect on both growth and alkaloid content. Drought increased alkaloid content, but retarded growth. High light intensity lowered alkaloid content but promoted growth. We investigated the relationship between primary production and the production of secondary metabolites with respect to relative and total alkaloid content as well as in relation to the leaves' nitrogen status. Our results showed that under conditions of low nutrient supply, higher proportions of leaf nitrogen were allocated to alkaloids than at moderate or high nutrient supply. Under conditions of drought and low light, all plants allocated almost equal proportions of leaf nitrogen to alkaloids, regardless of fertiliser. Total alkaloid content per plant, however, increased with fertilisation. With respect to the N-allocation strategy, we found no indication of a trade-off between primary production and the production of secondary metabolites in this species.

It is essential that this variation be understood if trends in diversity are to be predicted with any degree of confidence under a scenario of global change. Here we examine patterns of butterfly species richness among groups differing in degree of habitat specialization, diet breadth and mobility in the north-west Mediterranean Basin, a European hotspot for this taxon. We analyze a large number of butterfly communities and take into consideration the main potential drivers, that include climatic, geographic and resource variables, landscape structure and human environmental impact at different spatial scales. Our study shows that both climatic and anthropogenic factors play an important role in determining butterfly species richness in the north-west Mediterranean Basin, but that their relative impact differs between specialist and generalist groups. At lower altitudes, water availability, a product of the interplay between temperature and rainfall, and negative effects of temperature appear as the most determinant factors. Maximum diversity was observed at mid-altitudes, which reveals the importance from a conservation point of view of Mediterranean mountain ranges. The results suggest serious population declines in specialist species restricted to mountain areas as a result of climate warming in combination with habitat loss caused by the abandonment of grazing and mowing. They also suggest negative trends for generalist species due to an increase in aridity in combination with an increase in intensification of human land use in lowland areas. Such synergies are expected to lead to rapid declines in Mediterranean butterfly populations in the coming years, thereby posing a severe threat for the conservation of European biodiversity.",34,2011,34,3,353,363"Meier, ES; Edwards, TC; Kienast, F; Dobbertin, M; Zimmermann, NE",Co-occurrence patterns of trees along macro-climatic gradients and their potential influence on the present and future distribution of Fagus sylvatica L.,JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,Article,"Aim During recent and future climate change, shifts in large-scale species ranges are expected due to the hypothesized major role of climatic factors in regulating species distributions. The stress-gradient hypothesis suggests that biotic interactions may act as major constraints on species distributions under more favourable growing conditions, while climatic constraints may dominate under unfavourable conditions. We tested this hypothesis for one focal tree species having three major competitors using broad-scale environmental data. We evaluated the variation of species co-occurrence patterns in climate space and estimated the influence of these patterns on the distribution of the focal species for current and projected future climates. Location Europe. Methods We used ICP Forest Level 1 data as well as climatic, topographic and edaphic variables. First, correlations between the relative abundance of European beech (Fagus sylvatica) and three major competitor species (Picea abies, Pinus sylvestris and Quercus robur) were analysed in environmental space, and then projected to geographic space. Second, a sensitivity analysis was performed using generalized additive models (GAM) to evaluate where and how much the predicted F. sylvatica distribution varied under current and future climates if potential competitor species were included or excluded. We evaluated if these areas coincide with current species co-occurrence patterns. Results Correlation analyses supported the stress-gradient hypothesis: towards favourable growing conditions of F. sylvatica, its abundance was strongly linked to the abundance of its competitors, while this link weakened towards unfavourable growing conditions, with stronger correlations in the south and at low elevations than in the north and at high elevations. The sensitivity analysis showed a potential spatial segregation of species with changing climate and a pronounced shift of zones where co-occurrence patterns may play a major role. Main conclusions Our results demonstrate the importance of species co-occurrence patterns for calibrating improved species distribution models for use in projections of climate effects.

The contrast in delta 13C between C3 and C4 plants allowed for calculation of the C3/C4 ratio from delta 13C of SOC with a two-member mixing model, which accounted for influences of aridity and altitude on delta 13C of the C3 end-member and for changes in delta 13C of atmospheric CO(2). Maps were created geostatistically, and showed a substantially lower C4 abundance in soil than in recent vegetation (-10%). The difference between soil and vegetation varied regionally and was most pronounced within an E-W belt along 44 degrees N and in a mountainous area, suggesting a spread of C4 plants toward northern latitudes (about 1 degrees) and higher altitudes.

Predation generally increased prey allocation to defence and caused prey selection lines to become more diverse. On average, prey became most defensive in the high-resource environment and suffered from reduced resource use ability more in the low-resource environment. As a result, the evolution of stronger prey defence in the high-resource environment led to a strong decrease in predator-to-prey ratio.

These require validation with observed data; in this respect, long-term data sets are particularly valuable. 2. Innovative statistical methods (nonparametric regression and additive models) are presented for identifying nonparametric ecological trends and changes in seasonality in response to environmental change. These are illustrated through the example of Loch Leven, a shallow freshwater lake. Monitoring data for 35 years are examined, spanning periods of enrichment, ecological recovery and changing climate. 3. Models are developed for phosphorus and nitrogen; temperature and rainfall; Daphnia grazers; and chlorophyll a, with the ecological objectives of examining trends in water quality and the corresponding trends in nutrient availability, grazer abundance and climate. 4. The analysis highlighted a generally decreasing availability of P over the study period, and generally increasing nonparametric trends in nitrate concentration and rainfall. Increasing spring temperatures were also evident, as were significant nonparametric changes in density of summer grazers. 5.

Human disturbance promotes adaptive responses at the genomic, individual and population levels. Traits vary widely in whether adaptation occurs through plasticity or evolution, and these modes interact within and among traits. For example, plasticity in one trait may be adaptive because it permits homeostasis and lessens the intensity of selection in another. Both opportunity and catastrophe generate adaptive responses. Recently evolved adaptations characterize the responses of many native species to biotic invasions. Several well-known examples involve native phytophagous insects colonizing introduced plants. For example, our studies of North American and Australian soapberry bugs on nonindigenous plants demonstrate both diversifying and homogenizing contemporary evolution. Modes of adaptation differ among traits and populations and as a function of the host on which they develop. The genetic architecture of the evolving adaptations involves a substantial degree of nonadditive genetic variation. One important consequence of contemporary adaptation may be an enhanced capacity of native communities to provide adaptive biological control of invasive species.

These lines were obtained by artificial selection on KRHT and subsequent inbreeding from a stock that was derived from a single wild population. Heat-induced expression of the 70KD heat-shock protein (Hsp70) was also examined for variation between the lines. Composite interval mapping was performed for each trait on each reciprocal backcross, identifying one QTL region in the middle of chromosome 2 for both KRHT and CCR.

To address this gap, we documented the spatiotemporal prevalence of sex-biased weevil damage in a gynodioecious strawberry. We then conducted path analysis to evaluate the direct and indirect pathways for weevils to affect female and male fertility and to mediate selection in two experimental gardens. Direct effects of weevils significantly reduced fertility and mediated selection on reproductive traits, even in the nonpreferred sex (females). Weevils significantly reduced floral display size in hermaphrodites in both gardens, and this translated into a substantial negative indirect effect on male fertility in the garden where the pathway to fertility via display was stronger. Thus, indirect effects of weevils can contribute to selection in hermaphrodites, which gain the majority of their fitness via male function. Our results also indicate that weevils often play a larger role than pollinators in shaping reproductive phenotype and thus raise the intriguing possibility that antagonists may be drivers of sexual dimorphism.

At high densities (> 125 animals[L), the negative effects or cadmium on daily reproduction rates increased with density hence density promoted the negative effects of cadmium on X. At low, food levels (0.4 mug C/mL of Chorella vulgaris), increasing population density reduced juvenile survival, increasing food per head. Thus adverse effects of cadmium on reproduction, which had the greatest contribution to lambda, were buffered by increasing population density. Regression analysis performed on population responses across increasing population density levels and cadmium concentrations showed that at high densities and low food levels ecological compensation will prevent populations at the steady-state equilibrium size from being driven to extinction by toxicity effects at the individual level. Alternatively, at low densities, when food availability is not limiting, exposure to toxic substances can increase extinction probability. These results indicate that risk assessment procedures based on demographic analysis performed at low densities and high food levels may Overestimate the ecological risk posed by toxic substances.",34,2002,12,2,552,564"Hojer, R; Bayley, M; Damgaard, CF; Holmstrup, M",Stress synergy between drought and a common environmental contaminant: studies with the collembolan Folsomia candida,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Article,"The term global change is used predominantly in connection with the global temperature increase and associated changes in weather patterns over the next century. In a broader sense it also covers other anthropogenic impacts on the environment such as habitat fragmentation and pollution. The individual effects of each of these stress types have been extensively studied in the biota. However, organisms will frequently encounter these stress types in combination rather than alone and there is little information available on the effects of stress combinations. Here an examination is made of the interaction between realistic levels of summer drought and a common contaminant of agricultural soil (4-nonylphenol, NP), on a widespread soil invertebrate, the collembolan Folsomia candida. These stress factors were tested individually and in combination using a full factorial design. This approach revealed the existence of highly significant Bliss type synergistic interaction between the two stress types. Thus, exposure to NP significantly reduced the drought tolerance of this organism and, reciprocally, the toxicity of NP (LC(50)) during realistic summer drought was more than doubled in comparison to the value obtained under optimal soil moisture conditions. Furthermore, it is shown that NP has a detrimental effect on the physiological mechanisms underlying this animal's drought tolerance, thus providing some explanation for the mechanisms involved in the synergy. It is argued that this type of synergy is unlikely to be confined to this particular combination of stresses and thus there is a need to study the interactions between dominant natural stresses and pollution. The most important implication of these results is that some of the effects of global climate changes can be predicted to be most severe in polluted areas.",34,2001,7,4,485,494"Anderson, JJ",A vitality-based model relating stressors and environmental properties to organism survival,ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS,Article,"A survivorship curve is shaped by the differential survivability of the organisms within the population, and a change in a survivorship curve with a stressor reflects the differential response of the organisms to the stressor. Quantifying this linkage in a simple, rigorous way is valuable for characterizing the response of populations to stressors and ultimately for understanding the evolutionary selection of individuals exposed to stressors. To quantify this stressor-individual-population linkage with as few parameters as possible. I present a simple mechanistic model describing organism survival in terms of age-dependent and age-independent mortality rates. The age-independent rate is represented by a Poisson process. For the age-dependent rate, a concept of vitality is defined, and mortality occurs when an organism's vitality is exhausted. The loss of vitality over age is represented by a continuous Brownian-motion process, the Weiner process; vitality-related mortality occurs when the random process reaches the boundary of zero vitality. The age at which vitality-related mortality occurs is represented by the Weiner-process probability distribution for first-arrival time. The basic model has three rate parameters: the rate of accidental mortality, the mean rate of vitality loss, and the variability in the rate of vitality loss. These rates are related to body mass, environmental conditions, and xenobiotic stressors, resulting in a model that characterizes intrinsic and extrinsic factors that control a population's survival and the distribution of vitality of its individuals. The model assumes that these factors contribute to the rate parameters additively and linearly. The model is evaluated with case studies across a range of species exposed to natural and xenobiotic stressors. The mean rate of vitality loss generally is the dominant factor in determining the shape of survival curves under optimal conditions. Xenobiotic stressors add to the mean rate in proportion to the strength of the stressor. The base, or intrinsic, vitality loss rate is proportional to the - 1/3 power of adult body mass across a range of iteroparous species. The increase in vitality loss rate with a xenobiotic stressor can be a function of body mass according to the allometric relationship of the organism structures affected by the stressor. The model's applicability to dose-response studies is illustrated with case studies including natural stressors (temperature, feeding interval, and population density) and xenobiotic stressors (organic and inorganic toxicants). The model provides a way to extrapolate the impact of stressors measured in one environment to another environment; by characterizing how stressors alter the vitality probability distribution, it can quantify the degree to which a stressor differentiates members of a population.",34,2000,70,3,445,470"Coors, A; Decaestecker, E; Jansen, M; De Meester, L",Pesticide exposure strongly enhances parasite virulence in an invertebrate host model,OIKOS,Article,"Parasites are a common and constant threat to organisms at all levels of phyla. The virulence of a parasite, defined as the impact on survival and reproduction of its host, depends on the specific host-parasite combination and can also be influenced by environmental conditions. Environmental pollution might be an additional factor influencing host-parasite interactions. We here aimed to test whether the combined stress of pollutant exposure and parasite challenge results in stronger impacts on host organisms than expected from the single stressors applied alone. We used the water flea Daphnia magna and two of its endoparasites, the bacterium Pasteuria ramosa and the microsporidium Flabelliforma magnivora, as invertebrate host-parasite models. For each parasite, we tested in a full-factorial design for interactions between parasitism and pollution using the neurotoxic pesticide carbaryl as a model substance. Sublethal concentrations of the pesticide synergistically enhanced the virulence of both parasites by increasing host mortality. Furthermore, host castration induced by P. ramosa was accelerated by carbaryl exposure. These effects likely reflect decreased host resistance due to direct or indirect immunosuppressive activity of carbaryl. The present study provides experimental evidence that the in vivo development of infectious diseases can be influenced by a pesticide at environmentally realistic concentrations. This implies that host-parasite interactions and subsequently co-evolution might be influenced by environmental pollution at toxicant concentrations being sublethal to parasite-free hosts. Standard toxicity testing as employed in the current way of conducting ecological risk assessments for anthropogenic substances does not consider natural antagonists such as infectious diseases, and thereby likely underestimates the impact these substances may pose to natural populations in the environment.",33,2008,117,12,1840,1846"Forde, SE; Thompson, JN; Holt, RD; Bohannan, BJM",Coevolution drives temporal changes in fitness and diversity across environments in a bacteria-bacteriophage interaction,EVOLUTION,Article,"Coevolutionary interactions are thought to play a crucial role in diversification of hosts and parasitoids. Furthermore, resource availability has been shown to be a fundamental driver of species diversity. Yet, we still do not have a clear understanding of how resource availability mediates the diversity generated by coevolution between hosts and parasitoids over time. We used experiments with bacteria and bacteriophage to test how resources affect variation in the competitive ability of resistant hosts and temporal patterns of diversity in the host and parasitoid as a result of antagonistic coevolution. Bacteria and bacteriophage coevolved for over 150 bacterial generations under high and low-resource conditions. We measured relative competitive ability of the resistant hosts and phenotypic diversity of hosts and parasitoids after the initial invasion of resistant mutants and again at the end of the experiment. Variation in relative competitive ability of the hosts was both time- and environment-dependent. The diversity of resistant hosts, and the abundance of host-range mutants attacking these phenotypes, differed among environments and changed over time, but the direction of these changes differed between the host and parasitoid.

We investigated exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides and evaluated the association between notoedric mange, an ectoparasitic disease, and anticoagulant exposure in bobcats (Lynx rufus) and mountain lions (Puma concolor) in a fragmented urban landscape in southern California, USA. Beginning in 2002, an epizootic of notoedric mange, a disease previously reported only as isolated cases in wild felids, in 2 years reduced the annual survival rate of bobcats from 0.77 (5-yr average) to 0.28. Anticoagulants were present in 35 of 39 (90%) bobcats we tested, multiple compounds were present in 27 of these 35 (77%), and total toxicant load was positively associated with the use of developed areas by rachocollared animals. Mange- associated mortality in bobcats showed a strong association with anticoagulant exposure, as 19 of 19 (100%) bobcats that died with severe mange were also exposed to the toxicants, and for bobcats with anticoagulant residues >0.05 ppm, the association with mange was highly significant (chi(2) = 10.36, P = 0.001). We speculate that concomitant elevated levels of rodenticide exposure may have increased the susceptibility of bobcats to advanced mange disease. Bobcats were locally extirpated from some isolated habitat patches and have been slow to recover. In 2004, 2 adult mountain lions died directly from anticoagulant toxicity, and both animals also had infestations of notoedric mange, although not as advanced as in the emaciated bobcats that died with severe disease. Two other mountain lions that died in intraspecific fights also exhibited exposure to 2-4 different anticoagulants. These results show that the effects of secondary poisoning on predators can be widespread, reach even the highest-level carnivores, and have both direct and possibly indirect effects on mortality.

Species composition and site factors were recorded on a total of 182 plots and the management history of each catchment was reviewed. H. pilosella was present on >80% of all plots, but was at an early stage of invasion in one catchment (<5% cover) and dominant in the other (25% cover). Classification and ordination revealed strong between-catchment differences in community composition that reflected differences in environment (soil fertility and rainfall), disturbance history (animal populations and burning), and the stage of invasion by H. pilosella. In both catchments H. pilosella tended to be least abundant on the wettest, driest, and most fertile soils. However, such relationships were weak. Generalised additive models and regression showed that in the earlier stage of invasion individual site factors explained less than 20% of the variation in H. pilosella cover. Topographic position and slope (both indicative of soil moisture) were the most significant combined predictors, but together explained only 32% of the variation. In the later stage of invasion individual factors explained up to 33% of the variation. Topsoil sulphur, slope, and topsoil calcium were the most significant combined predictors, but together explained only 53% of the variation. Between-catchment comparisons highlighted the inter-related roles of environment, disturbance history, geographic location, availability of H. pilosella propagules, and stage of invasion in more fully explaining the abundance of H. pilosella. Of five models that have been proposed for Hieracium invasion, the: ""grassland decline"" model best incorporated the inter-related factors that influence spatial and temporal variation in H. pilosella abundance in the study area. This model concentrates on identifying predisposing and trigger factors that increase the likelihood of invasion and accounts for multiple causes and interactions by specifying five key factors that influence the ability of a plant species to invade existing vegetation: environment, disturbance, vegetation structure and composition, life history attributes of the invader, and the availability of invading propagules.

Through meta-analysis, we determine narrowing discrimination from an empirical linear relationship between experimental N-15 and N-15 values of prey consumed. The resulting scaled N-15 framework estimated reliable TPs of zooplanktivores to tertiary piscivores congruent with known feeding relationships that radically alters the conventional structure of marine food webs. Apex predator TP estimates were markedly higher than currently assumed by whole-ecosystem models, indicating perceived food webs have been truncated and species-interactions over simplified.

Location (1) Field data from grazed semi-natural grasslands, NE Germany; (2) artificial data. Methods Research questions associated with traitenvironment relationships were briefly reviewed and seven available methods evaluated. The main distinction between research questions is whether traitenvironment relationships should be addressed at community or species level. A redundancy analysis (RDA) of mean trait values of species in a plot weighted by their abundances (CWM-RDA) is exclusively suitable for the community level. The other six methods address the species level. A double inertia analysis of two arrays (RLQ) and double canonical correspondence analysis (double CCA) use combinations of ordinations to simultaneously analyse species and trait responses to the environment. A combination of the outlying mean index with generalized additive models (OMI-GAM) predicts the response of species to environmental variables on trait gradients. RDA-RegTree first analyses species responses to the environment with RDA and then uses a regression tree to classify trait expressions according to scores of species responses on the ordination axes. Cluster regression uses cluster analyses and logistic regression to search for trait combinations with the best response to the environmental variables. This method models the distribution of functional groups on environmental gradients. All methods and data are available as R scripts. Results All methods consistently revealed the main trait responses to environment in the field data set, namely that life history was associated with available phosphorus while grazing intensity was related to leaf C:N ratio and canopy height. At community level, CWM-RDA gave a good overview of traitenvironment relationships, as also provided by the species-based methods RLQ and double CCA. OMI-GAM revealed non-linear relationships in the field data set. Field and artificial data gave that the number and stability of functional groups produced by Cluster regression and RDA-RegTree varied more strongly than RLQ, double CCA and OMI-GAM. Conclusions Each method addresses particular ecological concepts and research questions. If a user asks for the response of average trait expressions of communities to environmental gradients, CWM-RDA may be the first choice. However, species-based methods should be applied to address questions regarding co-existence of different life histories or to assess how groups of species respond to environmental changes.

Mussels experience a wide range of environmental conditions at these locations, including rapid changes in salinity and physical disturbance (both natural and from aquaculture practices). This paper addressed the hypothesis that reduced salinity will lower mussel blood immune function and influence mussel blood metabolic responses, and that this will in turn increase the susceptibility of mussels to other stresses such as physical disturbance. To test these hypotheses, experiments were conducted in controlled laboratory tank conditions and mussel blood was analysed using a combination of metabolic fingerprinting with FT-IR and immunological assay techniques. Reducing seawater salinity to half that of normal caused a significant reduction in several measures of immune function, including the concentration of haemocytes, percentage of eosinophilic haemocytes and phagocytosis. Mechanical shaking of mussels for 10 min caused a reduction in the level of respiratory burst activity. However, there was no evidence of additive or interactive effects of lowered salinity with shaking on the immune response. Analysis of mussel blood metabolic fingerprints revealed differences in response to half salinity (vs. full salinity) but there were no detectable effects of shaking. Increasing frequency and magnitude of flood events at coastal sites due to climate change could lead to longer, and more frequent, periods of reduced salinity. The potential impact on the immune function of this keystone species within or near estuaries could have knock-on effects on the wider ecosystem including altered nutrient cycling, changes in biodiversity and aquaculture production.

Different nitrogen forms (organic-N and inorganic-N), N:P ratios, light:dark cycles and salinity significantly influenced algal growth, but not ROS production. However, iron concentration and pH significantly affected both growth and ROS production in C marina. KCN (an inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration) and 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyt)-1,1-dimethylurea (an inhibitor of photosynthesis) had no significant effects on ROS production. Vitamin K-3 (a plasma membrane electron shuttle) enhanced ROS production while its antagonist, dicumarol, decreased ROS production.

Previously, we have demonstrated large phenotypic variation in mt gene expression, and a higher frequency of high-expression phenotypes in a tolerant population. Here, we describe midparent offspring regression analysis of mt gene expression in a laboratory culture originating from a noncontaminated natural population. Families were either not exposed (n = 47) or exposed to 0.5 mu mol Cd per gram dry food (n = 46). Mean mt gene expressions normalized to 28S rRNA and beta-actin RNA were generated using real-time RT-PCR applied to parents and offspring RNA and subjected to regression analysis. A significant heritability (h(2)) for mt gene expression was estimated between 0.36 (beta-actin normalized) and 0.46 (28S normalized) in Cd exposed families. Nontreated families did not yield a significant h(2) value. Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism analysis of the metallothionein promoter sequence revealed eight promoter alleles that show structural variation. Three alleles show increased frequencies in families with high mt expression. Another gene, croquemort (isolated from a differential screening for 1 mu mole Cd treatment) showed no h(2) of gene expression in response to 0.5 mmol Cd.

We developed indices based on regression models between, grass, shrub, litter, exposed-soil groundcover components and Landsat thematic mapper satellite imagery reflectance values over a reference site in the northern Chihuahuan Desert in New Mexico. This site supports low-disturbance grasslands that have been under a continuous grazing regime for over 100 years. Greater richness and abundance of noninvasive and nonruderal plant species were associated with the low-disturbance grasslands that had lower shrub abundance, increased litter and grass cover, and lower exposed soil. Using the thematic mapper indices, we computed an additive grassland biodiversity index such that, as exposed soil and shrub values go down, litter and grass values go up, as does the biodiversity index. When the biodiversity index was applied to the reference-site landscape, grasslands previously identified for their high conservation value were detected. As a further test, we applied the indices to a site in Chihuahua, Mexico, that supports similar grasslands but for which there are few other data on condition and conservation values. The soil, grass, and shrub indices were moderately effective in describing the range of variation at the Mexico site, but the litter equation was not. Still, higher biodiversity value in terms of nonruderal plant diversity tended to correspond to higher grass cover and lower soil exposure and a higher overall biodiversity index. Some localized calibration with geologic substrate may be required along with an assessment of the temporal constraints, but generally the index shows promise for quickly and efficiently detecting desert grasslands of high biodiversity conservation value.",32,2001,15,4,844,855"Cronin, JT; Abrahamson, WG",Goldenrod stem galler preference and performance: effects of multiple herbivores and plant genotypes,OECOLOGIA,Article,"Few studies have examined how the preference-performance relationship of an herbivore for different genotypes of its host plant is affected by the presence and/or feeding activity of other members of the herbivore assemblage. In an outdoor garden, we manipulated the abundance of three common herbivores, the meadow spittlebug, a leaf beetle, and an aphid, on replicate 1-m(2) plots of 16 different genotypes of tall goldenrod, Solidago altissima. Adults of the goldenrod stem galler, Eurosta solidaginis, were subsequently released into the garden to oviposit among the host plants. Oviposition preference was strongly influenced by plant genotype and the presence of two of the herbivores, spittlebugs and leaf beetles. The effects of the herbivores were additive: the presence of leaf beetles reduced preference by 6%, spittlebugs by 18%, and both herbivores combined by 25%. Plant genotype-herbivore species interaction effects on stem-galler preference, which would indicate the presence of genetic variation among goldenrod genotypes in their norms of reaction for their acceptability as a host to the stem galler, were absent in this study. The performance of the stem galler was also significantly affected by goldenrod genotype, but in general was not affected by the presence of herbivores early in the season (the exception was a positive correlation between the proportion of ramets infested by all herbivores and gall size). Overall, we could find no correlation between preference and performance. This is in accord with results from previous studies on this system that were performed in the absence of herbivores, suggesting that the presence of herbivores in this study did not qualitatively alter the preference-performance relationship. We suggest that the lack of a positive correlation between host-plant preference and larval performance may reflect a constraint on the discriminatory ability of female stem gallers preventing them from selecting the best hosts among plants that differ in genotype and level of environmental stress (e.g., presence of interspecific herbivores).",32,2001,127,1,87,96"Pringle, CM",Threats to US public lands from cumulative hydrologic alterations outside of their boundaries,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,Article,"U.S. public lands are increasingly threatened by human alteration of hydrologic connections outside their boundaries. Cumulative effects of dams, impoundments, regulated flows, wetlands drainage, and groundwater extraction outside of public land boundaries can play a key role in controlling the hydrology and biology within these managed areas. Expanding human populations require more water, and they often look to public lands to meet their demands. Immediate challenges facing water resource managers are increased pressure to dam rivers and pump aquifers near public lands, as a result of water shortages exacerbated by droughts coupled with increased demands from municipal and agricultural growth. As pollutants become more concentrated in less water, water quality often becomes a major related issue. While these problems are particularly acute in rapidly growing regions of the arid West where water is severely limited, they are also emerging in the East. Data on cumulative effects of hydrologic alterations on the biological integrity of public lands have not been systematically assessed at a national level. However, emerging trends can be used to gauge the magnitude of outside pressures and to place water resource challenges into context. The U.S. National Park Service is participating in water rights adjudications in over 50 different park service units. The U.S. Forest Service currently has over 500 legal claims concerning water rights for national forests located in 55 basins of 11 Western states. Similar conflicts exist for national wildlife refuges which are particularly vulnerable to water quality and quantity problems because of their small size; in 1994, 150 out of 224 Western wildlife refuges reported conflicts with other water users, and only 98 reported that their existing water rights assured delivery of adequate water in an average year.

Two case studies from different biogeographic extremes (Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge in the arid Nevada desert and the Caribbean National Forest in the wet tropics of Puerto Rico) illustrate the synergism that can occur between field managers and scientists in implementing localized solutions.

We tested the influence on coral extension rate from the interactive effects of human populations and thermal stress, calculated here with degree-heating-months (DHM). We find that when the effects of chronic local stressors, represented by human population, are taken into account, recent reductions in extension rate are better explained than when DHM is used as the sole predictor.

Most importantly, interactions among these drivers frequently generate nonadditive effects that cannot be predicted based on single-factor studies. Our goal was to assess the joint effects of three global change drivers that are especially relevant in Mediterranean ecosystems, namely, fragmentation, reduced habitat quality, and climate change on Centaurea hyssopifolia, a gypsum specialist plant. We carried out a two-year study (2005-2006) in natural populations of this plant in large (>11 ha) and small (<1.5 ha) fragments. Within each fragment, we identified areas of contrasting habitat quality as revealed by plant cover and nutrient content, and within each combination of habitat quality and fragment size we performed a rainfall manipulation experiment simulating the most likely future climate scenario for the region. Survival, growth, phenology, and reproductive success of selected plants were monitored. The three drivers profoundly affected responses of Centaurea hyssopifolia in both study years, phenology being mainly affected by changes in habitat quality and reductions in rainfall and reproductive traits being mainly affected by fragmentation. Plants in sites of poor habitat quality and plants in the dry treatment advanced most of their phenophases (flowering and dispersing earlier) and showed reduced growth rate and increased fraction of senescent leaves. Plants growing in small fragments had lower survival, lower number of viable seeds, and a reduced seed set compared to those from large fragments. We found significant synergistic interactions among drivers. For example, the interaction between fragmentation and habitat quality led to lower survival and lower relative growth in plants from small and poor-quality habitat sites. Our results highlight the importance of studies addressing simultaneously all relevant drivers of global change potentially affecting plant performance under natural conditions. In addition, the complex responses of phenology and reproductive traits of C. hyssopifolia emphasize the need for studies integrating traits from vegetative to reproductive and from the organ to the whole-plant level.",31,2009,90,9,2609,2621"Goodson, JL; Kabelik, D; Schrock, SE",Dynamic neuromodulation of aggression by vasotocin: influence of social context and social phenotype in territorial songbirds,BIOLOGY LETTERS,Article,"The homologous neuropeptides vasotocin (VT) and vasopressin (VP) influence agonistic behaviours across many taxa, but peptide-behaviour relationships are complex and purportedly species- specific.

Using limiting factor omission analyses, we showed that the suite of native insect herbivores causing seed losses had a larger impact than the joint effects of rosette damage by sheep and summer drought acting on seedling establishment. Removal of insect herbivores increased the native population growth rate by 166% on average; removal of sheep damage and summer drought from the model increased population growth by 51%. Specialist herbivores and drought interacted synergistically to affect reproduction. 5. Synthesis and applications. We show that vital rate elasticity analysis provides more management information than elasticity analysis on the level of matrix elements, particularly when management options affect only certain vital rates. For example, it can be used to make predictions about the effectiveness of predispersal floral herbivores in control management. The model can also help identify ways in which biocontrol can be augmented using integrated weed management that reduces seedling establishment probabilities, for example by preventing overgrazing. This method illustrates how native range studies of invasive species can be used to generate insights into managing populations in the invaded range.",31,2006,43,5,877,886"Vonesh, JR","Sequential predator effects across three life stages of the African tree frog, Hyperolius spinigularis",OECOLOGIA,Article,"While theoretical studies of the timing of key switch points in complex life cycles such as hatching and metamorphosis have stressed the importance of considering multiple stages, most empirical work has focused on a single life stage. However, the relationship between the fitness components of different life stages may be complex. Ontogenetic switch points such as hatching and metamorphosis do not represent new beginnings-carryover effects across stages can arise when environmental effects on the density and/or traits of early ontogenetic stages subsequently alter mortality or growth in later stages. In this study, I examine the effects of egg- and larval-stage predators on larval performance, size at metamorphosis, and post-metamorphic predation in the African tree frog Hyperolius spinigularis. I monitored the density and survival of arboreal H. spinigularis clutches in the field to estimate how much egg-stage predation reduced the input of tadpoles into the pond. I then conducted experiments to determine: (1) how reductions in initial larval density due to egg predators affect larval survival and mass and age at metamorphosis in the presence and absence of aquatic larval predators, dragonfly larvae, and (2) how differences in mass or age at metamorphosis arising from predation in the embryonic and larval environments affect encounters with post-metamorphic predators, fishing spiders. Reduction in larval densities due to egg predation tended to increase per capita larval survival, decrease larval duration and increase mass at metamorphosis. Larval predators decreased larval survival and had density-dependent effects on larval duration and mass at metamorphosis. The combined effects of embryonic and larval-stage predators increased mass at metamorphosis of survivors by 91%. Larger mass at metamorphosis may have immediate fitness benefits, as larger metamorphs had higher survival in encounters with fishing spiders. Thus, the effects of predators early in ontogeny can alter predation risk even two life stages later.",31,2005,143,2,280,290"Fox, BJ; Fox, MD; Taylor, JE; Jackson, GP; Simpson, J; Higgs, P; Rebec, L; Avery, R","Comparison of regeneration following burning, clearing or mineral sand mining at Tomago, NSW .1. Structure and growth of the vegetation",AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Article,"We have begun a long-term ecological research project to address questions about the impact of multiple disturbances on the species richness of communities and whether multiple disturbances are additive or interactive. A protected water catchment area was chosen, which is subjected to fires, sand mining and clearing, and for which detailed records are available. The study area, at Tomago (32 degrees 52'S, 151 degrees 45'E), has forest, woodland, shrubland and swamp on a sand substrate, with the vegetated dunes forming part of a coastal embayment. Forty-four sites were located in forested areas that had undergone disturbance by either fire, sand mining or clearing. Sites of each disturbance type were grouped into four age classes: less than 1 year since disturbance, nominally 1991; 5 years, nominally 1986; 11 years, nominally 1980; and 17 years, nominally 1974. A set of burned sites, with the time of the last fire matched to the times of the other disturbances, was used as the control response. In this paper we describe the study area and sites, then examine the effects of each single disturbance on vegetation structure. Canopy cover increased with time and type of disturbance, with 17 year old cleared or mined sites similar to the cover of 11 year old burned sites. In the first two years after disturbance, burned sites had significantly more understorey vegetation than cleared or mined sites, but by 5 years all three were similar. The data presented here show that regeneration of mined sites at Tomago is substantially slower than regeneration following disturbance by fire, with the regeneration of cleared sites intermediate but, closer to mining than fire. After 17 years regeneration, cleared and sand mined sites had not returned to the vegetation structure of the pre-disturbance state. Understorey height and the amount of vegetation on cleared or mined sites have not achieved the levels in the original forest, although canopy cover did seem to have reached pre-disturbance levels. Current rehabilitation techniques are more sophisticated than those used 17 years ago and continued monitoring of sites currently being rehabilitated may show a faster return to pre-disturbance states. Having established the hierarchy and nature of the response to each single disturbance here, we are now in a position to investigate the impact of multiple disturbances.",31,1996,21,2,184,199"Mortelliti, A; Amori, G; Capizzi, D; Cervone, C; Fagiani, S; Pollini, B; Boitani, L","Independent effects of habitat loss, habitat fragmentation and structural connectivity on the distribution of two arboreal rodents",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,Article,"P>1. Habitat loss must be distinguished from habitat fragmentation so that appropriate conservation management can be applied. Few studies have evaluated the independent effects of habitat loss and habitat fragmentation on the distribution of vertebrates, and none has evaluated the independent effect of changes in structural connectivity. We carried out a landscape-scale experiment to assess the independent contribution of these three processes and to examine what landscape scale factors affect the distribution of two forest-dependent arboreal rodents: the hazel dormouse Muscardinus avellanarius and the red squirrel Sciurus vulgaris. 2. Habitat loss, rather than habitat fragmentation per se, was the major driver of distribution patterns for both species. As predicted, structural connectivity (hedgerow networks) played an important role in determining the distribution of the hazel dormouse, but not of the red squirrel. 3. Our models predict that long lengths of hedgerows (> 30 km) are unlikely to increase the probability of occurrence of hazel dormouse in landscapes where there are low levels of forest cover (< 5%-10%). 4. Synthesis and applications. Our empirical findings indicate that structural connectivity and habitat loss may have additive effects on vertebrate distribution. For the hazel dormouse, improving structural connectivity will be ineffective if the amount of forest cover in the landscape is less than 5-10%. The key message from this study is that resources should not be invested in landscape linkages until their efficacy for the given level of suitable habitat has been assessed.",30,2011,48,1,153,162"O'Farrell, PJ; Reyers, B; Le Maitre, DC; Milton, SJ; Egoh, B; Maherry, A; Colvin, C; Atkinson, D; De Lange, W; Blignaut, JN; Cowling, RM",Multi-functional landscapes in semi arid environments: implications for biodiversity and ecosystem services,LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,Article; Proceedings Paper,"Synergies between biodiversity conservation objectives and ecosystem service management were investigated in the Succulent Karoo biome (83,000 km(2)) of South Africa, a recognised biodiversity hotspot. Our study complemented a previous biodiversity assessment with an ecosystem service assessment. Stakeholder engagement and expert consultation focussed our investigations on surface water, ground water, grazing and tourism as the key services in this region. The key ecosystem services and service hotspots were modelled and mapped. The congruence between these services, and between biodiversity priorities and ecosystem service priorities, were assessed and considered in relation to known threats. Generally low levels of overlap were found between these ecosystem services, with the exception of surface and ground water which had an 80% overlap. The overlap between ecosystem service hotspots and individual biodiversity priority areas was generally low. Four of the seven priority areas assessed have more than 20% of their areas classified as important for services. In specific cases, particular service levels could be used to justify the management of a specific biodiversity priority area for conservation. Adopting a biome scale hotspot approach to assessing service supply highlighted key management areas. However, it underplayed local level dependence on particular services, not effectively capturing the welfare implications associated with diminishing and limited service provision. We conclude that regional scale (biome level) approaches need to be combined with local level investigations (municipal level).

This study has adapted a complementarity-based area-selection method to estimate conservation value/irreplaceability for river systems. Irreplaceability represents the likelihood that an area will be required as part of a conservation system that achieves all conservation targets. We adapt this measure - often used in marine or terrestrial planning - to consider whole-of-catchment protection in a riverine setting. 2. After dividing the Australian state of Victoria into 1854 subcatchments, we successfully modelled distributions of 400 benthic macroinvertebrate taxa using generalized additive models. We calculated the minimum area required to protect all taxa using three different heuristic selection algorithms. The algorithms were modified to consider the entire upstream catchment for any subcatchment. 3. A summed rarity algorithm, corrected for upstream area, proved to be the most efficient, requiring 100 000 hectares less total catchment area to represent all taxa than the second most efficient algorithm. We calculated irreplaceability by running the algorithm 1000 times and randomly removing 90% of the catchments in each run. From this analysis, we estimated two metrics: Fs (the frequency of selection) and average c (average contribution to conservation targets). 4. Four groups of catchments were identified: (i) catchments that have high contributions and are always or very frequently selected; (ii) catchments that have high contributions and are infrequently selected; (iii) catchments that are always or very frequently selected but contribute few taxa; and (iv) catchments that are infrequently selected and contribute few taxa. 5. Synthesis and applications. For the first time, a complementarity-based algorithm has been adapted to a riverine setting. This algorithm acknowledges the connected nature of rivers by considering not only the local assemblages, but also upstream areas that need to be protected. We demonstrated that using standard algorithms in these connected systems would lead to two mistakes, namely: (i) not all taxa would be covered by reserves that were buffered from potential human disturbances upstream; and (ii) the standard algorithms would not lead to the most efficient solution, potentially costing additional millions of dollars to any conservation scheme. We therefore recommend the use of our algorithm or a similar riverine adaptation of reserve design algorithms to ensure adequate and efficient conservation planning.",30,2008,45,5,1486,1495"Moore, TN; Fairweather, PG","Decay of multiple species of seagrass detritus is dominated by species identity, with an important influence of mixing litters",OIKOS,Article,"No studies of seagrass decay have examined effects of the number of species contained within the detrital pool.

Experimental results clearly showed that species identity was the predominant driver of mass loss, with total loss not differing between bags containing one, two and three species. Furthermore, we show there were also non-additive effects of mixing litter that were not predicted from single-species decay rates. The nature of the non-predictable mass loss varied both through time and with the number of species in the mixtures. This indicates that species richness indeed plays a role in this important ecosystem function but one that is of less importance than species identity. The concordance of these results with terrestrial studies suggests that mechanisms responsible for mixed-species decay rates may be broadly applicable across ecosystems.",30,2006,114,2,329,337"Pahkala, M; Rasanen, K; Laurila, A; Johanson, U; Bjorn, LO; Merila, J",Lethal and sublethal effects of UV-B/pH synergism on common frog embryos,CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,Article,"Although the negative effects of ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation on the development of many amphibian species have been demonstrated, some species-such as the common frog (Rana temporaria)-seem to be tolerant of UV-B radiation. The amount of UV-B radiation received is likely to vary among populations of the same species, but little is known about geographic variation in UV-B tolerance. Similarly, although UV-B radiation can have synergistic effects with other stressors, no studies have focused on geographic variation of these effects on amphibians. We investigated the synergistic effects of UV-B radiation and low pH on hatchability and early development of R. temporaria embryos in a factorial laboratory experiment with animals originating from southern and northern Sweden. Newly fertilized eggs were exposed to three different UV-B treatments (no UV-B [control], 1.254 k/J/m(2) [normal] and 1.584 k/J/m(2) [26% enhanced]) and two pH treatments (4.5 [low] and 7.6 [neutral]). Ultraviolet-B radiation in combination with low pH lead to markedly (approximately 50%) reduced survival rates and increased (approximately 30%) frequency of developmental anomalies in the northern but not in the southern population. The UV-B- exposed embryos hatched at smaller size in the southern population, whereas low pH reduced hatchling size in both populations. In both populations and pH treatments, embryos in the normal UV-B treatment developed significantly faster than embryos in the enhanced or control UV-B treatments. No interaction between pH and UV-B on developmental rates or hatchling size was detected. The results demonstrate-contrary to earlier belief-that R. temporaria embryos are not insensitive to increased levels of UV-B radiation. The lethal effects of UV-B radiation may, however, become manifested only in combination with other stressors, such as low pH, and the effects of this synergism may differ among different populations of the same species.",30,2002,16,4,1063,1073"Cummins, CP; Greenslade, PD; McLeod, AR","A test of the effect of supplemental UV-B radiation on the common frog, Rana temporaria L., during embryonic development",GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Article,"The release of certain man-made chemicals has led to recurrent, seasonal destruction of ozone in the upper atmosphere, allowing more solar radiation in the UV-B waveband to reach the Earth.

We exposed newly fertilized eggs of one such species, Rana temporaria L., to sunlight with and without supplemental UV-B. We used outdoor arrays of lamps to simulate the increase in UV-B which might result from previously documented ozone depletion. From immediately after fertilization to when hatchlings began feeding, ambient solar UV-B, weighted for DNA-damaging potential, was supplemented by approximate to 81% in 1995 and 113% in 1996. These levels of supplementation approximated the increase in solar UV-B expected to result from losses of 21% and 25%, respectively, of the total amount of ozone in the atmospheric column, relative to pre-ozone-depletion values.

While rapid progress is made in the search for genes that control differences between plant populations, it is typically unknown whether the genes under study are in fact key targets of habitat-specific natural selection. Using a quantitative trait loci (QTL) approach, we show that a QTL associated with flowering-time variation between two locally adapted wild barley populations is an important determinant of fitness in one, but not in the other population's native habitat. The QTL mapped to the same position as a habitat-specific QTL for field fitness that affected plant reproductive output in only one of the parental habitats, indicating that the genomic region is under differential selection between the native habitats. Consistent with the QTL results, phenotypic selection of flowering time differed between the two environments, whereas other traits (growth rate and seed weight) were under selection but experienced no habitat-specific differential selection. This implies the flowering-time QTL as a driver of adaptive population divergence. Our results from phenotypic selection and QTL analysis are consistent with local adaptation without genetic trade-offs in performance across environments, i.e. without alleles or traits having opposing fitness effects in contrasting environments.",29,2008,17,14,3416,3424"Carrillo, P; Delgado-Molina, JA; Medina-Sanchez, JM; Bullejos, FJ; Villar-Argaiz, M",Phosphorus inputs unmask negative effects of ultraviolet radiation on algae in a high mountain lake,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Article,"Ultraviolet solar radiation (UVR) and atmospheric nutrient loads to pristine ecosystems are global climate change phenomena that simultaneously affect aquatic organisms in ways not easily predicted by single factor studies. Plankton in a high mountain lake was exposed in situ to increasing phosphorus (P) concentrations (mimicking atmospheric pulses) in absence or presence of UVR in order to identify their interactive effect on functional [primary production, organic carbon (C) release (EOC), and percentage of C released (%EOC)], growth rate, structural-physiological (algal biomass, sestonic C, P content, chlorophyll a (Chl a), and Chl a:C ratio, P cell quota, cell-specific Chl a), and stoichiometric (autotroph C: P ratio) traits. The availability of P after the pulse determined the intensity of responses by primary producers to UVR stress. All structural-physiological and functional variables significantly increased by up to two orders of magnitude in response to P enrichment. UV radiation, over a long-term scale, exerted significant deleterious effects on most structural-physiological variables when inorganic P was added at high levels (>= 30 mu g PL-1). The subsequent unexpected negative synergistic UVR x P effect on algal development did not support our initial hypothesis that P input might buffer the harmful UVR effect. UVR exerted a weak negative effect on primary production but strongly enhanced the absolute and percentage excretion of C (up to 60%), mechanism responsible of a significant reduction in autotroph C: P ratios. We propose that low sestonic C:P ratios are the outcome of an adaptive strategy of algae in environments with high UVR exposure and extreme nutrient limitation and have important implications for C flux through grazing vs. microbial food webs in oligotrophic systems.",29,2008,14,2,423,439"Ruesink, JL",Biotic resistance and facilitation of a non-native oyster on rocky shores,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,Article,"The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas varies dramatically in density throughout its introduced range in the northeast Pacific; this could be driven by environmental constraints or by species interactions that change across habitats. I studied the effects of native species on this invader across a range of environmental contexts where it is common (mid-intertidal zone, low wave exposure) vs. where it is rare (low intertidal zone, high wave exposure) in Barkley Sound, Vancouver Island, Canada. I carried out factorial manipulations of 2 guilds of native species (neighbors, i.e. filter feeders such as mussels and barnacles, and predators such as crabs and whelks) and recorded survival and linear shell growth of transplanted, newly settled oysters (juveniles similar to 1 cm in size). C. gigas responded dramatically to tidal elevation: growth improved but survival declined at lower elevations, where feeding time and predation were greater. Wave exposure reduced shell growth over 2 mo from 11.4 mm at protected sites to 7.2 mm at exposed sites, but variation in survival was not statistically significant. Both guilds of native species exerted biotic resistance: predators reduced oyster survival and neighbors reduced growth. Surprisingly, neighbors improved oyster survival at some wave-exposed sites, thereby facilitating one demographic variable related to invasion while restricting another. Finally, predation had equivalent effects on survival at wave-exposed and protected sites, although different predators were probably involved. Post-recruitment phenomena were unable to account for variation in oyster density across sites, and propagule pressure is a likely driver instead.

Courted females dispersed only about half as fast as did solitary females. Blood lactate levels were higher in mating than in courting or noncourting snakes of both sexes; the high levels of lactate in mating females support the idea that courtship is physiologically stressful to these animals, perhaps via constraints to female respiration. In arena trials, females that were exercised to exhaustion before courtship mated with smaller males than did control females. The spatial distribution of snakes around the den exhibits substantial heterogeneity, with densities often varying markedly between adjacent areas.

Here we test the hypothesis that endogenous corticosterone plays a key physiological role in the control of foraging behavior and parental care, using a combination of exogenous corticosterone treatment, time-depth telemetry, and physiological sampling of female macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) during the brood-guard period of chick rearing, while simultaneously monitoring patterns of prolactin secretion. Plasma corticosterone levels were significantly higher in females given exogenous implants relative to those receiving sham implants. Increased corticosterone levels were associated with significantly higher levels of foraging and diving activity and greater mass gain in implanted females. Elevated plasma corticosterone was also associated with an apparent fitness benefit in the form of increased chick mass.

Records of alien species in databases of such heterogeneous landscapes remain scarce, posing a challenge for statistical modelling. We address this issue and attempt to shed light on the role of environmental stress/disturbance gradients and propagule pressure on invasibility of plant communities in these typical model systems. Location: Sandy coasts of Lazio (Central Italy). Methods: We proposed an innovative methodology to deal with low prevalence of alien occurrence in a data set and high cost of field-based sampling by taking advantage, through predictive modelling, of the strong interrelation between vegetation and abiotic features in coastal dunes. We fitted generalized additive models to analyse (1) overall patterns of alien occurrence and spread and (2) specific patterns of the most common alien species recorded. Conclusion: Even in the presence of strong propagule pressure, variation in local abiotic conditions can explain differences in invasibility within a local environment, and intermediate levels of natural disturbance and stress offer the best conditions for spread of alien species. However, in our model system, propagule pressure is actually the main determinant of alien species occurrence and spread.

Knowledge about quantitative relationships between the extent of herbivore-induced damage and the quantities of VOCs released is scarce. We studied the kinetics of VOC-emissions from foliage of the deciduous tree Alnus glutinosa induced by feeding activity of larvae of the geometrid moth Cabera pusaria. Quantitative relationships between the intensity of stress and strength of plant response were determined. Intensity of biotic stress was characterized by herbivore numbers (0-8 larvae) and by the amount of leaf area eaten. The strength of plant response was characterized by monitoring (i) changes in photosynthesis, (ii) leaf ultrastructure, and (iii) plant volatiles. Net assimilation rate displayed compensatory responses in herbivore-damaged leaves compared with control leaves. This compensatory response was associated with an overall increase in chloroplast size. Feeding-induced emissions of products of the lipoxygenase pathway (LOX products; (E)-2-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexenol, 1-hexanol, and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate) peaked at day 1 after larval feeding started, followed by an increase of emissions of ubiquitous monoterpenes peaking on days 2 and 3. The emission of the monoterpene (E)-beta-ocimene and of the nerolidol-derived homoterpene 4,8-dimethyl-nona-1,3,7-triene (DMNT) peaked on day 3. Furthermore, the emission kinetics of the sesquiterpene (E,E)-alpha-farnesene tended to be biphasic with peaks on days 2 and 4 after start of larval feeding. Emission rates of the induced LOX products, of (E)-beta-ocimene and (E,E)-alpha-farnesene were positively correlated with the number of larvae feeding. In contrast, the emission of DMNT was independent of the number of feeders. These data show quantitative relationships between the strength of herbivory and the emissions of LOX products and most of the terpenoids elicited in response to feeding. Thus, herbivory-elicited LOX products and terpenoid emissions may convey both quantitative and qualitative signals to antagonists of the herbivores.

The earth's expanding human population is altering both pattern and process in ecosystems, and hence is impacting the provision of ecosystem goods and services at a variety of scales. Food production and other ecosystem services, such as the many benefits provided by forests, are not exclusive of one another at a regional scale. Although it is becoming obvious that uncoordinated local management is inadequate to address regional ecosystem changes in the face of regional drivers of change, few regional governments have addressed the need for holistic landscape management of regional ecosystem services. We compare and contrast two regional programs, the agricultural agenda of integrated pest management (IPM) and an as-yet hypothetical, fragmentation-oriented conservation agenda that we term 'Regional Fragmentation Management' (RFM). IPM has a strong practical foundation but is weak on theory. RFM has a stronger theoretical base, but is weak on practice and has mainly focused on protected areas. Both programs address only a small subset of the larger question of how to effectively maintain regional production of regional ecosystem services. Some of the successes of IPM practitioners in building institutions and achieving societal acceptance for their program, particularly in relation to regionally coordinated ('areawide') pest management, suggest that regional ecosystem management is plausible. IPM offers some ingredients of an institutional role model for a broader, more ambitious program that seeks to manage regional ecosystem services and processes in a sustainable manner.

The simulations illustrate that changes both in the magnitude of climate variability and in the persistence of above/below average conditions have the potential to modify the vegetation response to changes in mean climate. Simulated changes in moisture availability affect vegetation through drought stress or through changing the fuel availability in semi-arid regions where lack of fuel often limits the incidence of fire. Increasing moisture availability causes trees to replace grasses in China by reducing drought stress; increasing moisture availability in the Sahel increases the available fuel and hence reduces fire return times, favouring grasses. The modelling results imply that climate variability is important to vegetation dynamics; that not only the magnitude, but also the temporal structure of variability is important; and that correctly simulating vegetation changes in response to climate variability requires a realistic ""baseline"" simulation of plant community composition. They further indicate that the impacts of climate change on ecosystems can sometimes derive as much from changes in variability as from changes in mean climate. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Both the size and symmetry of elements of the sex comb have been shown previously to be under sexual selection in a natural population in northeastern Australia. Two independent reciprocal crosses were conducted at 25 degrees and 29 degrees C between genetic lines extracted from this Population that differed in the size of the first (TC1) and third (TC3) comb segments. These temperatures are within the documented range experienced by the species in nature. Additive and dominance genetic effects were detected for TC1. whereas additive genetic, and Y-chromosomal effects were detected for TC3. TC2 and TC3 decreased sharply with increasing temperature, by 10% and 22%, respectively. In contrast, positional fluctuating asymmetry (PFA) significantly increased with temperature, by up to 38%. The results (1) document an important source of environmental variance in a sexual ornament expected to reduce trait heritability in field populations, and thus act to attenuate response to sexual selection, (2) suggest that variation in ornament size reflects differences in male condition; and (3) Support the general hypothesis that asymmetry in a sexual ornament is indicative of developmental instability arising from environmental stress. The ""environmental heterogeneity'' (EH) hypothesis is proposed, and supportive evidence for it presented, to explain negative size-FA correlations in natural populations.

We explored how tree diversity in these fragments has been affected by (1) impoverishment of the mammal community and (2) changes in abiotic conditions following island formation ca. 90 years ago. To test effects of changes in the mammal community, we assessed seed and seedling survival for nine tree species in five forests: small islands with no mammals; small islands with spiny rats but no larger mammals; medium islands (intermediate mammal community); Barro Colorado Island (intermittently present puma and jaguar); and mainland forests (intact mammal community). To test effects of abiotic stress, we chose experimental sites at wind-exposed, wind-protected, and interior forest sites. We predicted that fragments with less diverse mammal communities would be characterized by (1) fewer seeds dispersed and cached, (2) lower long-term seed survival, and (3) higher rates of seedling herbivory by mammals. Where alteration of the environment has caused greater exposure to dry-season winds, we predicted that (4) germination and seedling establishment and (5) dry-season seedling survival would be low. Further, we expected that (6) dry-season seedling survival would increase if soil moisture levels were raised, but that (7) wet-season seedling survival is independent of wind exposure. In the larger forests, seed and seedling survival were low, and differences in mammal community composition had little effect. Small islands that supported only rats had the same low seed survival as larger forests. Elimination of all mammals resulted in much higher seed survival, and slightly higher seedling survival. Germination and seedling survival were lower at wind-exposed than at protected sites, but irrigation had no effect on dry-season seedling survival. It appears that the dominant species on Gatun Lake fragments have passed through a series of filters: seeds must first avoid being eaten by spiny rats, survive the first dry season, and then avoid seedling herbivory by rats. Biotic and abiotic factors determine seedling survival in tropical forests; synergistic changes in these factors can thus lead to dramatic losses of diversity.",28,2005,86,2,379,390"Bukovinszky, T; Trefas, H; van Lenteren, JC; Vet, LEM; Fremont, J",Plant competition in pest-suppressive intercropping systems complicates evaluation of herbivore responses,AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,Article,"In the light of current theories on the effects of intercropping on pest reduction, population responses of the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella), the cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae) and the life history traits of the large white butterfly (Pieris brassicae) were studied in a Brussels sprout (Brassica oleracea gemmifera)/malting barley (Hordeum vulgare) additive row intercrop and a Brussels sprout monoculture. More P. xylostella adults were caught in the monoculture than in the intercrop. Numbers of R xylostella larvae and pupae per sprout plant were lower in intercropped plots than in monocultures. However, more larvae and pupae were found per m(2) leaf area in the inter- than in the monocrop. Both the densities per plant and per m(2) leaf area of B. brassicae populations were lower in the inter- than in the monocrop. After the barley withered and competition with Brussels sprout abated, aphid densities became higher in the inter- than in the monocrop. These findings may be explained by interspecific plant competition resulting in stressed sprout plants with a smaller size and delayed phenology relative to monocropped plants. Effects of differences in plant nutritional quality on herbivore performance were studied by offering leaves of inter- and monocropped sprout plants to larval R brassicae. Performance and food utilisation were significantly better on leaves from the intercrop, (lower dry weight consumption, higher growth rates) than from the monocrop. Defoliation rate was also higher on leaves of intercropped plants than on monocropped ones. The studies indicate that plant stress and consequent changes in developmental rate and nutritional quality of plants are playing a role in herbivore population responses to intercropping.

Small-scale effects of wood on fish dominate the literature, but effects on populations and communities at the basin scale are not additive because increasing development of wood-influenced habitats modifies the transport of water, nutrients, and sediments. This, in turn, creates and maintains habitat resulting in increased spatial and temporal diversity and system resilience, which subsequently affect different life cycles of riverine fishes. Such effects depend on location; the relative influence of instream wood on fish and physical processes tends to decrease downstream in large basins, but the converse may be true in floodplains as their influence increases downstream. Because climatic factors control hydrology and temperature throughout the basin, and fish responses to management depend on large-scale, longer term processes as well as smaller ones, the research results reviewed here are assessed in the context of a basin-scale framework, the Ecohydrology Concept (EHC). A restoration strategy based on a basin-scale framework fosters a natural disturbance regime, increases the ability of the system to absorb impacts, and utilizes natural processes in the development of management tools. Reintroduction of wood in large rivers is an essential strategic component but will not, on its own, achieve significant benefits for fish and other biota without at least partial restoration of hydrological cycles, riparian vegetation, selected floodplains, and the associated natural disturbance regime.",28,2003,37,,195,211"Pausas, JG; Ribeiro, E",The global fireproductivity relationship,GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,Article,"Aim It has been suggested that on a global scale, fire activity changes along the productivity/aridity gradient following a humped relationship, i.e. the intermediate fireproductivity hypothesis. This relation should be driven by differing relative roles of the main fire drivers (weather and fuel) along the productivity gradient. However, the full intermediate fireproductivity model across all world ecosystems remains to be validated. Location The entire globe, excluding Antarctica. Methods To test the intermediate fireproductivity hypothesis, we use the world ecoregions as a spatial unit and, for each ecoregion, we compiled remotely sensed fire activity, climate, biomass and productivity information. The regression coefficient between monthly MODIS fire activity and monthly maximum temperature in each ecoregion was considered an indicator of the sensitivity of fire to high temperatures in the ecoregion. We used linear and generalized additive models to test for the linear and humped relationships. Results Fire occurs in most ecoregions. Fire activity peaked in tropical grasslands and savannas, and significantly decreased towards the extremes of the productivity gradient. Both the sensitivity of fire to high temperatures and above-ground biomass increased monotonically with productivity. In other words, fire activity in low-productivity ecosystems is not driven by warm periods and is limited by low biomass; in contrast, in high-productivity ecosystems fire is more sensitive to high temperatures, and in these ecosystems, the available biomass for fires is high. Main conclusion The results support the intermediate fireproductivity model on a global scale and suggest that climatic warming may affect fire activity differently depending on the productivity of the region. Fire regimes in productive regions are vulnerable to warming (drought-driven fire regime changes), while in low-productivity regions fire activity is more vulnerable to fuel changes (fuel-driven fire regime changes).",27,2013,22,6,728,736"Relyea, RA",New effects of Roundup on amphibians: Predators reduce herbicide mortality; herbicides induce antipredator morphology,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,Article,"The use of pesticides is important for growing crops and protecting human health by reducing the prevalence of targeted pest species. However, less attention is given to the potential unintended effects on nontarget species, including taxonomic groups that are of current conservation concern. One issue raised in recent years is the potential for pesticides to become more lethal in the presence of predatory cues, a phenomenon observed thus far only in the laboratory. A second issue is whether pesticides can induce unintended trait changes in nontarget species, particularly trait changes that might mimic adaptive responses to natural environmental stressors. Using outdoor mesocosms, I created simple wetland communities containing leaf litter, algae, zooplankton, and three species of tadpoles (wood frogs [Rana sylvatica or Lithobates sylvaticus], leopard frogs [R. pipiens or L. pipiens], and American toads [Bufo americanus or Anaxyrus americanus]). I exposed the communities to a factorial combination of environmentally relevant herbicide concentrations (0, 1, 2, or 3 mg acid equivalents [a.e.]/L of Roundup Original MAX) crossed with three predator-cue treatments (no predators, adult newts [Notophthalmus viridescens], or larval dragonflies [A flax junius]). Without predator cues, mortality rates from Roundup were consistent with past studies. Combined with cues from the most risky predator (i.e., dragonflies), Roundup became less lethal (in direct contrast to past laboratory studies). This reduction in mortality was likely caused by the herbicide stratifying in the water column and predator cues scaring the tadpoles down to the benthos where herbicide concentrations were lower. Even more striking was the discovery that Roundup induced morphological changes in the tadpoles. In wood frog and leopard frog tadpoles, Roundup induced relatively deeper tails in the same direction and of the same magnitude as the adaptive changes induced by dragonfly cues. To my knowledge, this is the first study to show that a pesticide can induce morphological changes in a vertebrate. Moreover, the data suggest that the herbicide might be activating the tadpoles' developmental pathways used for antipredator responses. Collectively, these discoveries suggest that the world's most widely applied herbicide may have much further-reaching effects on nontarget species than previous considered.",27,2012,22,2,634,647"Levin, DA",Environment-enhanced self-fertilization: implications for niche shifts in adjacent populations,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Review,"1. Pollen-mediated gene flow from ecological core populations may hamper the ability of populations to invade new, closely adjacent habitats. The potential for the invasion of a new habitat is enhanced when selection against immigrants is augmented by the elevation of self-fertilization. This shift imparts a measure of reproductive isolation to the invader. 2. Whereas genetically mediated changes in selfing often accompany niche shifts in plants, the elevation of self-fertilization by plastic responses to novel, stressful, environments has not been explored. Here I will show that invaders of novel habitats may have elevated levels of self-fertility mediated by alterations in floral form and self-compatibility. 3. Heightened selfing facilitates the evolution of local adaptation by increasing the additive genetic variance for tolerance to the new habitat. Heightened selfing also facilitates local adaptation by increasing reproductive assurance. 4. Elevated levels of selfing based on developmental responses are immediate, as opposed to that obtained by multigenerational selection. 5. Synthesis. The likelihood of a niche shift will be substantially enhanced if the invader is protected from the swamping effect of gene flow from a nearby core population. This protection may be afforded by an environment-induced elevation of self-fertility. The likelihood of a niche shift also is enhanced by an increase in reproductive assurance which may be vital to the survival of an invading population whose reproductive success is density-dependent.",27,2010,98,6,1276,1283"Schlipalius, DI; Chen, W; Collins, P; Nguyen, T; Reilly, P; Ebert, P","Gene interactions constrain the course of evolution of phosphine resistance in the lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica",HEREDITY,Article,"Phosphine, a widely used fumigant for the protection of stored grain from insect pests, kills organisms indirectly by inducing oxidative stress. High levels of heritable resistance to phosphine in the insect pest of stored grain, Rhyzopertha dominica have been detected in Asia, Australia and South America. In order to understand the evolution of phosphine resistance and to isolate the responsible genes, we have undertaken genetic linkage analysis of fully sensitive (QRD14), moderately resistant (QRD369) and highly resistant (QRD569) strains of R. dominica collected in Australia. We previously determined that two loci, rph1 and rph2, confer high-level resistance on strain QRD569, which was collected in 1997. We have now confirmed that rph1 is responsible for the moderate resistance of strain QRD369, which was collected in 1990, and is shared with a highly resistant strain from the same geographical region, QRD569. In contrast, rph2 by itself confers only very weak resistance, either as a heterozygote or as a homozygote and was not discovered in the field until weak resistance (probably due to rph1) had become ubiquitous. Thus, high-level resistance against phosphine has evolved via stepwise acquisition of resistance alleles, first at rph1 and thereafter at rph2. The semi-dominance of rph2 together with the synergistic interaction between rph1 and rph2 would have led to rapid selection for homozygosity.

Field parents were tested for fecundity at 14 degrees C or 28 degrees C depending on ambient temperatures. Wing/thorax length ratios measured on flies from the spring collection suggested that flies had developed at around 20 degrees C. Progeny were reared and tested at 14 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 28 degrees C. In the summer collection, parent-offspring regression coefficients were high and significant, compared to nonsignificant values obtained in two of three autumn comparisons. In the spring collection, parent-offspring regressions were negative regardless of testing temperature, suggesting that field females with a high fecundity produced offspring with low scores. Comparisons of F(1) and F(2) laboratory generations indicated intermediate heritabilities for fecundity in the laboratory. The lower bound heritability estimate for fecundity in field individuals was 37% in summer and 59% in autumn.

Integrative studies on ageing patterns in multiple traits of organisms are challenging and rare in free-living populations. However, developing integrative approaches could prove useful to understanding ageing patterns as causes of age variations are diverse, with conflicting or related actions. Accordingly, we investigated age variation of multiple aspects in the common lizard Lacerta (Zootoca) vivipara. 2. In a wild population of common lizards, we studied five fitness components, three physiological traits (cell-mediated immunity, corticosterone level, resting metabolic rate), and controlled for individual and environmental heterogeneities. To quantify ageing patterns in fitness, we used individual-based data collected over 14 years (18 684 captures, 892 reproductive events). 3. Ageing patterns were found in multiple aspects. They provided evidence for female maturation early in adulthood (access to reproduction, litter size), followed by senescence in female reproduction (litter success) and survival. In parallel to senescence, a pattern of terminal investment enhanced offspring quality (offspring body size, offspring corpulence, litter success). Ageing patterns involved physiology with higher metabolic rate and T cell-mediated immune response in old females. 4. Several ageing patterns were dependent on environmental and individual characteristics (habitat, year, sex, body size). Interestingly, senescence occurred only in females with a high reproductive effort early in life. Rarely showed, this trade-off between early and late-life performances is expected under the antagonistic pleiotropy and disposable soma theories of senescence. 5.

The backbone of this pathway consists of the GacS/GacA two-component system, which activates the expression of three small regulatory RNAs (RsmX, RsmY, RsmZ) and thereby counters translational repression exerted by the RsmA and RsmE proteins on target mRNAs encoding biocontrol factors. We found that the expression of typical biocontrol factors, that is, antibiotic compounds and hydrogen cyanide (involving the phlA and hcnA genes), was significantly lower at 35 degrees C than at 30 degrees C. The expression of the rpoS gene was affected in parallel. This temperature control depended on RetS, a sensor kinase acting as an antagonist of the GacS/GacA system. An additional sensor kinase, LadS, which activated the GacS/GacA system, apparently did not contribute to thermosensitivity. Mutations in gacS or gacA were epistatic to (that is, they overruled) mutations in retS or ladS for expression of the small RNAs RsmXYZ.

The two cues acted in an additive fashion. In the second experiment, we demonstrated that disturbance cues alone were not enough to elicit a conditioned response to the odour of a novel predator.

The major risks include increased resistance to particular pesticides, gene flow into related plant species, and negative effects on non-target organisms. Significant gaps in knowledge, often stemming from missing markets for ecological services, warrant a cautious environmental regulatory approach for transgenic crops. The objective of this paper is to identify the types of ecological systems public research to implement effective biosafety controls. US biosafety regulatory processes tend to focus on controlling type I error, i.e. restricting the release of the crops when significant environmental risks do not exist, because the economic losses from denying commercialization can be estimated. However, the precautionary principle, which focuses on controlling type II errors, i.e. releasing the crops when serious ecosystem damage will occur, adds a necessary criterion given the current deficit in ecological science. The key challenge facing regulators is to find the appropriate balance of controlling type I versus type II errors. The research program should embed the lessons of evolutionary biology and ecological sciences. Viewing the plant as a production machine that can be ""brute-force"" reengineered for more efficiency is a poor analogy. Unanticipated and unintended results, positive and negative, will emerge from such engineering because plants are complex systems embedded in poorly understood, complex, and interacting ecosystems. An ideal public research program should capture the interconnectedness of ecological systems, the essential roles of ecosystem services, nonlinear and threshold responses to accumulating stresses, and global expansion of the technology. Basic elements of such a program include long-term studies of cumulative and synergistic pesticide resistance effects, potential gene flow problems for those transgenic crop trait-weed complexes with high probabilities of outcrossing and ecological disruption, and scientific protocols for assessing deleterious effects on non-target organisms. For all three effects, expanded ecosystem monitoring of the commercialized crops in varied settings is needed for improved type II error definitions and estimates. The development of improved risk analysis methodologies and protocols should also be a priority. Finally, scientific effort to stimulate precautionary research, such as the development of transgenic crops that mimic ecological systems functioning, could avert many risks. Creating information to avoid significant ecological damages and foster precautionary research and development for transgenic crops are neglected roles of public biotechnology research.

In the Drentse A nature reserve, the Netherlands, a relatively productive grassland, represented by H. lanatus , has gradually been replaced by a less-productive community, represented by A. odoratum , after the application of fertiliser was stopped. Stressed plants are generally considered to be more sensitive to herbivory. 2 We hypothesized that plant-feeding nematodes would exacerbate the competitive disadvantage of H. lanatus resulting from nutrient limitation. We compared performance in an adjusted De Wit replacement series with monocultures, grown in soil that was either treated or untreated with nematicides at both low and high nutrient supply. 3 The biomass production of both plant species was negatively affected by intra- and interspecific competition. Although H. lanatus was a stronger competitor than A. odoratum in mixed cultures, it was more sensitive to plant-feeding nematodes and nutrient limitation. Nematodes and nutrient stress therefore reduced the competitive suppression of A. odoratum by H. lanatus . Low nutrient availability did not enhance the effect of plant-feeding nematodes on plant growth and competition, indicating additive rather than synergistic effects on plant performance. 4 We conclude that plant-feeding nematodes may contribute to species replacements in grasslands after fertilization has been stopped, albeit to a lesser extent than reduced nutrient availability.

Subzero growth coincides with unusual cell envelope features of encrustations surrounding cells, while the cytoplasmic membrane is significantly remodeled favouring a higher ratio of saturated to branched fatty acids. Analyses of the 3.4Mbp genome revealed that a suite of cold and osmotic-specific adaptive mechanisms are present as well as an amino acid distribution favouring increased flexibility of proteins. Genomic redundancy within 17% of the genome could enable P. halocryophilus Or1 to exploit isozyme exchange to maintain growth under stress, including multiple copies of osmolyte uptake genes (Opu and Pro genes). Isozyme exchange was observed between the transcriptome data sets, with selective upregulation of multi-copy genes involved in cell division, fatty acid synthesis, solute binding, oxidative stress response and transcriptional regulation. The combination of protein flexibility, resource efficiency, genomic plasticity and synergistic adaptation likely compensate against osmotic and cold stresses.

Datasets on rare species distribution usually have few observations, limited spatial accuracy and lack of valid absences; conversely they provide comprehensive views of species distributions allowing to realistically capture most of their realized environmental niche. Rare species are the most in need of predictive distribution modelling but also the most difficult to model. We refer to this contrast as the ""rare species modelling paradox"" and propose as a solution developing modelling approaches that deal with a sufficiently large set of predictors, ensuring that statistical models are not over-fitted. Our novel approach fulfils this condition by fitting a large number of bivariate models and averaging them with a weighted ensemble approach. We further propose that this ensemble forecasting is conducted within a hierarchic multi-scale framework. We present two ensemble models for a test species, one at regional and one at local scale, each based on the combination of 630 models. In both cases, we obtained excellent spatial projections, unusual when modelling rare species. Model results highlight, from a statistically sound approach, the effects of multiple drivers in a same modelling framework and at two distinct scales. From this added information, regional models can support accurate forecasts of range dynamics under climate change scenarios, whereas local models allow the assessment of isolated or synergistic impacts of changes in multiple predictors. This novel framework provides a baseline for adaptive conservation, management and monitoring of rare species at distinct spatial and temporal scales. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast, several butterfly populations had gone extinct between 2003 and 2006. Extinction probability was significantly related to initial population size, with small populations having a higher risk of extinction than large populations. These results support the prediction that species of higher trophic levels are more susceptible to extinction due to habitat fragmentation and severe disturbances.",25,2009,159,1,117,126"Davidson, AD; Lightfoot, DC",Burrowing rodents increase landscape heterogeneity in a desert grassland,JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS,Article,"Animals that modify their environment through engineering and herbivory have important impacts on ecosystems, yet the interactive roles of such species have rarely been studied. We studied the comparative and interactive effects of two burrowing herbivorous rodents, Gunnison's prairie dogs (Cynomys gunnisoni) and banner-tailed kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spectabilis), on vegetation where they co-occurred in a Chihuahuan Desert grassland. We found that their effects remained distinct and, thus, non-substitutable, where they co-occurred. The rodents differentially altered plant community structure relative to their different mound types, herbivory, and spatial scales of disturbance. Vegetation structure and plant species assemblages differed between mound and landscape patches occupied by prairie dogs and kangaroo rats. Where both species co-occurred, there was more soil disturbance, organic material from-their fecal pellets, forb cover, and activity by other animals. The combined effect of these rodents increased the landscape heterogeneity and plant species richness by creating a mosaic of different habitat patches on the landscape. Our results demonstrate that these rodents had complementary, additive effects where they co-occurred, and suggest that multiple habitat-modifying species, especially those that play large ecological roles, can have important interactive effects on community structure and biodiversity.

The habitat requirements for establishment, however, have only previously been described qualitatively. The aim of this study was to quantify the influence of topographical and environmental characteristics on the probability of establishment of this invasive shrub in a woodland environment. A binomial generalized linear model (GLM), incorporating spatial autocorrelation, was used to model the presence/absence of R. ponticum seedlings (<7-year-old plants) given substrate type an, I depth, canopy type and percent cover, altitude, slope, aspect and the distance to the nearest seed source as covariates. Depth and type of substrate along with distance from the closest seed source were found to be the most important predictors of seedling,establishment. Specifically, fallen logs or tree stumps, newly colonised by moss, were identified as the most favourable habitat type for R. ponticum invasion. We show that the inclusion of spatial autocorrelation can affect model conclusions and, as a consequence, may influence management recommendations. Knowing how to reduce establishment can assist in managing invasive populations. Similarly, understanding how establishment probabilities vary according to habitat may aid the conservation of threatened populations.

To examine its invasive potential, a greenhouse, additive series experiment (target-neighbour) involving seedlings of A. mangium and those of a common native heath-forest (kerangas), Melastoma beccarianum Cogn. was carried out under low and high light regimes in intra- and interspecific combinations over a 6-month period. Significant variations in growth parameters (other than biomass allocation patterns) existed amongst seedlings from different treatments. A major part of this variation in growth could be attributed to the main factors of target species., neighbour species, and competition (seedling density). For the growth variables examined, the target-species response was not consistent across light regimes. Under high light conditions, Acacia was the better competitor; the Lotka-Volterra competition coefficient effect of Melastoma on Acacia was lower (alpha = 0.30) than the effect of Acacia on Melastoma (beta = 0.54). However, the reverse occurred under low light conditions with Melastoma gaining the upper hand (alpha = 1.45 and beta = 0.44). These results show that light (and hence disturbance) can strongly influence the pattern and intensity of both intra- and interspecific competition between invasive and local flora species. Relatively intact forest is unlikely to be invaded by Acacia trees (as they are poor competitors under this scenario). On the other hand, the Acacia trees can easily invade disturbed forests, especially those prone to recurring drought and fire, and over time convert the habitats to nearly monospecific stands, as is presently being observed in Brunei.",25,2005,20,2,205,214"Walls, RL; Wardrop, DH; Brooks, RP",The impact of experimental sedimentation and flooding on the growth and germination of floodplain trees,PLANT ECOLOGY,Article,"Land-use changes in a forested floodplain's watershed can lead to incremental changes in the hydrology and sedimentation rates of the floodplain. The impacts of these changes can be difficult to measure due to the slow response time of mature trees. Seedlings and saplings, on the other hand, may show an immediate response. Responses during these early life history stages can have major consequences for regeneration of floodplain forests and ultimately result in community alteration. This study tested the importance of changes in hydrology and sedimentation on the germination and growth rates of three common floodplain tree species: Acer rubrum, Fraxinus pennsylvanica and Quercus palustris. Two-year-old saplings were grown in a greenhouse under two hydrologic regimes, with or without the addition of sediment. Neither periodic flooding with or without sediment nor static flooding on its own affected the growth of the seedlings. With the addition of sediment, static flooding for two weeks lead to a significant decrease in sapling growth. There was a significant species x treatment interaction, suggesting that each species responded differently to the application of flooding and sediment. The timing of germination and the total percent germination for F pennsylvanica and Q. palustris seeds were tested under the same conditions. Flooding and sediment acted in an additive manner to delay the germination of both E pennsylvanica and Q. palustris and to reduce the total germination rate of Q. palustris. There was no difference in the total germination rate of F pennsylvanica seeds under any treatment. During the growth trials, adventitious roots sprouted on saplings grown under sedimentation. Adventitious roots growing into sediment rather than floodwater should be able to utilize the sediment's nutrients and may compensate for some of the stress of flooding. The results of this study suggest that sediment tolerances will vary among species, but will not necessarily correlate with flood tolerances, and that sedimentation may be as important as flooding in determining floodplain plant community composition.",25,2005,176,2,203,213"Pelabon, C; Hansen, TF; Carlson, ML; Armbruster, WS",Variational and genetic properties of developmental stability in Dalechampia scandens,EVOLUTION,Article,"Because low developmental stability may compromise the precision with which adaptations can be reached, the variability and genetic basis of developmental stability are important evolutionary parameters. Developmental stability is also an important clue to understanding how traits are regulated to achieve their phenotypic target value. However, developmental stability must be studied indirectly through proxy variables, such as fluctuating asymmetry, that are suggested to have noisy and often nonlinear relationships to the underlying variable of interest. In this paper we first show that mean-standardized measures of variance and covariance in fluctuating asymmetry, unlike heritabilities, repeatabilities, and correlations, are linearly related to corresponding measures of variation in underlying developmental stability. We then examine the variational properties of developmental stability in a population of the Neotropical vine, Dalechampia scandens (Euphorbiaceae). By studying fluctuating asymmetry in a large number of floral characters in both selfed and outcrossed individuals in a diallel design, we assemble strong evidence that both additive genetic and individual variation and covariation in developmental stability are virtually absent in this population.",25,2004,58,3,504,514"Fowler, NL","The joint effects of grazing, competition, and topographic position on six savanna grasses",ECOLOGY,Article,"I investigated the separate and joint effects of herbivory (grazing) and competition on six grass species and on their distributions across the landscape. In a factorial field experiment, cattle were excluded from half the subplots, and neighboring plants were removed from half the subplots. Transplants of each of the species were planted in plots on hillsides and in flat areas, and the entire experiment was replicated in two pastures. The effects of grazing were negative and were proportional to the ungrazed height of each species. In the absence of grazing and competition, the flat plots were more favorable than the hillside plots. Grazing reversed the relative favorableness of flat and hillside plots, most likely because grazing was more intense in the flat plots due to cattle preference for flatter ground. The removal of neighboring plants always had a positive effect, indicating competition from neighboring plants. The relative impact of competition from pre-existing plants was generally greater in the flat plots than in the hillside plots. The relative impacts of grazing were generally greater in the absence of competing plants, and the relative impacts of competition were generally greater in the absence of grazing. The most likely explanation for this antagonistic interaction between the effects of herbivory and competition is an indirect positive effect of grazing that arose from a reduction in competition experienced by a target plant due to the defoliation of its neighbors. The results of this study, when combined with the known distributions of the six grass species in this region, indicate that herbivory, rather than competition or the physical environment, controls the distribution of at least five of the six species across the landscape. For example, Schizachyrium scoparium grew well in ungrazed flat subplots but very poorly in grazed flat subplots; grazing, got the physical environment or competition, accounts for the absence of S. scoparium from most flat sites in this region. Competition modulates the effects of herbivory and edaphic factors on landscape distributions but does not control the distribution of any, of the six species.",25,2002,83,9,2477,2488"Bubliy, OA; Loeschcke, V",Effect of low stressful temperature on genetic variation of five quantitative traits in Drosophila melanogaster,HEREDITY,Article,"A half-sib analysis was used to investigate genetic variation for three morphological traits (thorax length, wing length and sternopleural bristle number) and two life-history traits (developmental time and larva-to-adult viability) in Drosophila melanogaster reared at a standard (25degreesC) and a low stressful (13degreesC) temperature. Both phenotypic and environmental variation showed a significant increase under stressful conditions in all traits. For estimates of genetic variation, no statistically significant differences were found between the two environments. Narrow heritabilities tended to be higher at 13degreesC for sternopleural bristle number and viability and at 25degreesC for wing length and developmental time, whereas thorax length did not show any trend. However, the pattern of genetic variances and evolvability indices (coefficient of genetic variation and evolvability), considered in the context of literature evidence, indicated the possibility of an increase in additive genetic variation for the morphological traits and viability and in nonadditive genetic variation for developmental time.

We report experiments here in which selection applied to behavior affects features in an identical fashion. Selection for feeding rate of larval D. melanogaster modifies caloric intake, as measured by the uptake and incorporation of labeled glucose. Selection for slow larval feeding produced lines of D. melanogaster in which larvae synthesized significantly less lipid prior to pupation and eclosed to have low early-life fecundity and a long life as adults. They also had greater lifetime fecundity, but lower viability of egg to hatched adult. Alternatively, fast-feeding larvae incorporated more lipid before pupation and eclosed with high early-fecundity that declined rapidly throughout their short adult life. Slow-feeding populations also had a significantly enhanced expression of the stress-resistance genes CuZn-SOD, CATALASE, and HSP70. Selection on larval feeding behavior reproduced the antagonistic evolutionary trade-off found under selection for adult life span and mimicked the physiological response in life span as seen in many species when dietary restriction is imposed on adults, Thus, nutrient acquisition during development appears to share a common evolutionary and genetic basis with the allocation processes that determine adult life-history traits and the related phenotypic dietary restriction phenomena.",25,2001,55,12,2493,2502"Boughton, DA; Smith, ER; O'Neill, RV",Regional vulnerability: A conceptual framework,ECOSYSTEM HEALTH,Editorial Material,"Regional vulnerability assessment, or ReVA, is an approach to place-based ecological risk assessment that is currently under development by the off ice of Research and Development of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

The pilot ReVA is being developed for the U.S, mid-Atlantic region to identify those ecosystems, together with the ecological goods and services they provide, that are most vulnerable to being lost in the next 20 years. The project is currently exploring different conceptual approaches to integrated assessment. In this article, we give an operational approach to estimating ecosystem vulnerability and discuss important issues arising from it. The first issue is estimating vulnerability at the regional scale as opposed to the more familiar local scale. The second issue is integrating information about different sorts of risks in order to prioritize them at the regional scale. The challenge of integration is considerable because of the possibility of synergistic (mutually reinforcing) interactions between different environmental stresses. Synergistic effects are often too poorly known to include, yet potentially too important to ignore. Vulnerability at the regional scale may provide a pragmatic, middle-road approach to this problem by highlighting and characterizing geographic areas that are expected to change the most in the future.

The collembolans were initially exposed to the toxic compounds via soil and thereafter exposed to different degrees of drought stress in the laboratory. F. candida survived long-term exposure (7 days) in air with a relative humidity (RH) of 98.5 % at 20 degrees C. At the lowest humidity (96.8 % RH) survival in control animals was low, between 0 and 30 %. Animals previously exposed to nonylphenol and copper had decreased drought survival compared to control animals, whereas the chemicals alone had no lethal effect. The effects of LAS were not statistically significant although there was a tendency to lowered drought tolerance in exposed animals. The possible physiological mechanisms involved in drought tolerance, and how these may be affected by chemicals, are discussed.

Evaluating the impacts of multiple stressors on community dynamics can be particularly challenging in species-rich ecosystems, such as coral reefs. Here, we investigate whether life-history strategies and cotolerance to different stressors can predict community responses to fishing and temperature-driven bleaching using a 20-year time series of coral assemblages in Kenya. We found that the initial life-history composition of coral taxa largely determined the impacts of bleaching and coral loss. Prior to the 1998 bleaching event, coral assemblages within no-take marine reserves were composed of three distinct life histories competitive, stress-tolerant and weedy and exhibited strong declines following bleaching with limited subsequent recovery. In contrast, fished reefs had lower coral cover, fewer genera and were composed of stress-tolerant and weedy corals that were less affected by bleaching over the long term. Despite these general patterns, we found limited evidence for cotolerance as coral genera and life histories were variable in their sensitivities to fishing and bleaching. Overall, fishing and bleaching have reduced coral diversity and led to altered coral communities of survivor' species with stress-tolerant and weedy life histories. Our findings are consistent with expectations that climate change interacting with existing human pressure will result in the loss of coral diversity and critical reef habitat.",24,2013,19,6,1930,1940"Watson, SJ; Taylor, RS; Nimmo, DG; Kelly, LT; Haslem, A; Clarke, MF; Bennett, AF",Effects of time since fire on birds: How informative are generalized fire response curves for conservation management?,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,Article,"Fire is both a widespread natural disturbance that affects the distribution of species and a tool that can be used to manage habitats for species. Knowledge of temporal changes in the occurrence of species after fire is essential for conservation management in fire-prone environments. Two key issues are: whether postfire responses of species are idiosyncratic or if multiple species show a limited number of similar responses; and whether such responses to time since fire can predict the occurrence of species across broad spatial scales. We examined the response of bird species to time since fire in semiarid shrubland in southeastern Australia using data from surveys at 499 sites representing a 100-year chronosequence. We used nonlinear regression to model the probability of occurrence of 30 species with time since. fire in two vegetation types, and compared species' responses with generalized response shapes from the literature. The occurrence of 16 species was significantly influenced by time since fire: they displayed six main responses consistent with generalized response shapes. Of these 16 species, 15 occurred more frequently in mid- or later-successional vegetation (>20 years since fire), and only one species occurred more often in early succession (<5 years since fire). The models had reasonable predictive ability for eight species, some predictive ability for seven species, and were little better than random for one species. Bird species displayed a limited range of responses to time since fire; thus a small set of fire ages should allow the provision of habitat for most species. Postfire successional changes extend for decades and management of the age class distribution of vegetation will need to reflect this timescale. Response curves revealed important seral stages for species and highlighted the importance of mid- to late-successional vegetation (>20 years).

The extent to which mining interacts with other stressors to determine physical, chemical, and biological conditions in aquatic systems downstream is unclear. We conducted a watershed-scale assessment of Pigeon Creek, an intensively mined watershed of the Tug Fork drainage in Mingo County, West Virginia. Our objectives were to: 1) develop landscape-based indicators of mining and residential development, 2) quantify the interactive effects of mining and residential development on in-stream conditions, and 3) identify landscape-based thresholds above which biological impairment occurs in this watershed. Macroinvertebrate community structure was negatively correlated with intensity of mining and residential development. Correlation analysis and partial Mantel tests indicated that mining (% of total subwatershed area) caused acute changes in water chemistry (r = 0.55-0.91), whereas residential development (parcel density) strongly affected both physical habitat (r = 0.59-0.81) and macroinvertebrate community structure (r = 0.59-0.93).

Sites affected by equivalent levels of both stressors had lower Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera richness than sites affected by either stressor alone. Biological impairment thresholds occurred at similar to 25% total mining (equivalent to a specific conductance of similar to 250 mu S/cm) and at parcel densities of similar to 5 and 14 parcels/km(2).

Such assessments are difficult because of conceptual challenges and a lack of generally accepted criteria. We reviewed 12 protocols for assessing the threat status of communities and identified conceptual and operational issues associated with developing a rigorous, transparent, and universal set of criteria for assessing communities, analogous to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List standards for species. We examined how each protocol defines a community and its extinction and how each applies 3 overarching criteria: decline in geographic distribution, restricted geographic distribution, and changes to ecological function. The protocols vary widely in threshold values used to assess declines and distribution size and the time frames used to assess declines, leading to inconsistent assessments of threat status. Few of the protocols specify a scale for measuring distribution size, although assessment outcomes are highly sensitive to scale. Protocols that apply different thresholds for species versus communities tend to require greater declines and more restricted distributions for communities than species to be listed in equivalent threat categories. Eleven of the protocols include a reduction in ecological function as a criterion, but almost all assess it qualitatively rather than quantitatively. We argue that criteria should be explicit and repeatable in their concepts, parameters, and scale, applicable to a broad range of communities, and address synergies between types of threats. Such criteria should focus on distribution size, declines in distribution, and changes to key ecological functions, with the latter based on workable proxies for assessing the severity, scope, and immediacy of degradation. Threat categories should be delimited by thresholds that are assessed at standard scales and are logically consistent with the viability of component species and important ecological functions.",24,2009,23,2,259,274"Aguirre, AA; Tabor, GM",Global Factors Driving Emerging Infectious Diseases Impact on Wildlife Populations,Animal Biodiversity and Emerging Diseases: Prediction and Prevention,Article; Proceedings Paper,"The extinction of species across the globe is accelerating directly or indirectly from human activities. Biological impoverishment, habitat fragmentation, climate change, increasing toxification, and the rapid global movement of people and other living organisms have worked synergistically to diminish ecosystem function. This has resulted in unprecedented levels of disease emergence driven by human-induced environmental degradation, which poses a threat to the survival and health of biodiversity. What is often overlooked in the discussion of the health consequences to humans is that critically endangered wildlife species are at grave risk of extinction by disease outbreaks. As habitat becomes more compressed and with migration routes cut off, gene pools of small species are stranded in isolated habitat fragments. Species now are vulnerable to encroachment, malnutrition, environmental pollutants, and epidemics from domestic animals and humans. Furthermore, the continuous degradation of ecosystems is leading to increased stress, immunosuppression, and greater susceptibility to disease. Disease can be catastrophic to a diminished stressed population, becoming in some instances the leading factor of local, regional, and global extinctions. The strategies of the new field of conservation medicine include long-term monitoring, health assessment, and interventions to protect species at risk.

Specifically, we examined (1) the duration of spatial legacies of different management practices in the boreal forest, (2) how multiple shifts in management practices affect legacy duration and the spatial trajectories of forest age structure, and (3) how fire influences legacy duration and pattern development in combination with harvesting. Results based on 30 replicates of 500 years for each scenario indicate that (1) spatial legacies persist over 200 years and the rate at which legacies are overcome depends on whether new management targets are in synchrony with existing spatial pattern; (2) age specific goals were met faster after multiple management shifts due to the similar spatial scale of the preceding management types; (3) because large fires can erase the spatial pattern created by smaller disturbances, scenarios with fire had shorter lags than scenarios without fire.

Location California and Florida counties, conservation areas in the USA, and eight US cities. Methods Species lists among counties, conservation areas and cities were compared to see whether invasive and abundant non-native species increased the Jaccard index of similarity between localities beyond any increases caused by non-invasive and less abundant non-native species. Results For all comparisons, we found that invasive non-native species have a significantly greater homogenizing effect than non-invasive non-native species. For the US conservation areas, we found that locally abundant invasive species tend to be more widespread and more widely shared than less abundant invasive species. There is also a positive relationship between homogenization by invasive species and the magnitude of human disturbance. Main conclusions Invasive non-native species tend to be disproportionately shared among communities relative to non-invasive non-native species. This effect is enhanced by human disturbance, as measured by the ratio of non-native to native species. There is a synergism between abundance and geographical range which enhances the homogenizing effects of abundant species. Invasive species, with wide ecological niches, are more widely shared among communities and more locally abundant. Abundant invasive species are thus more spatially homogenizing, and more ecologically dominant (functionally homogenizing). Also, 'perceived homogenization' is probably greater than homogenization measured by the increase in shared species. The abundant species typically seen by the casual observer in a biological community are probably more commonly shared between communities than less common species. Studies that lack abundance data and measure homogenization only on the basis of shared species, which includes most homogenization studies to date, probably underestimate the homogenizing impacts of non-native species as perceived by people.",24,2007,16,3,394,400"Pueyo, Y; Alados, CL",Abiotic factors determining vegetation patterns in a semi-arid Mediterranean landscape: Different responses on gypsum and non-gypsum substrates,JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS,Article,"In arid and semi-arid regions water availability is the main factor determining vegetation patterns. On gypsum outcrops, vegetation is also conditioned by soil physical (i.e. surface crust) and chemical (i.e. ion unbalance) restrictions, which promote a highly specialist and endemic gypsophile flora. Topographical and climatic variability affect the rigors of gypsum soil environment, and thus, plant community distribution along environmental gradients can differ between gypsum and non-gypsum substrates. The aim of the paper was to evaluate the relative importance of different abiotic factors as drivers of plant communities in gypsum and non-gypsum substrates. While non-gypsophile vegetation is expected to be determined mainly by aridity, gypsophile vegetation could show more. complex patterns, following the relaxation of the rigors of gypsum soil under environmental gradients such as steep slopes and mesic conditions. We compared the relationships between presence and cover of three plant communities (open woodland, dwarf-shrubland and garrigue) on gypsum and non-gypsum substrates with environmental factors, after removing the effect of human use. Generalized additive models (GAM) and generalized linear models (GLM) were employed. Results showed that xeric conditions inhibited development and recovery of vegetation, but plant communities on gypsum substrate did not always respond in the same way as non-gypsum vegetation. While the degree of aridity (determined by precipitation and temperature) conditioned non-gypsum vegetation strongly, favouring less developed plant communities, topographical factors (slope aspect and angle) were the main determinants of gypsum plant community patterns. We conclude that gypsum substrate determines strongly the plant community patterns in a semi-arid Mediterranean landscape, as it can be observed by the strong response of gypsophile vegetation to the relaxation of the rigors of gypsum soils with topography (i.e. steep and north oriented slopes).

Previous studies have examined the responses of mature short shoots of T testudinum to environmental stresses. Our goal was to assess responses of seedlings to changes in water chemistry in Florida Bay that might occur as part of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP). Specifically, we examined seedling survival, growth, photosynthesis, respiration and osmolality in response to hypo- and hyper-salinity conditions, as well as possible synergistic effects of depleted and elevated ammonium concentrations. The study was conducted in mesocosms on T testudinum seedlings collected during August 2003 near Florida Bay. Hyper- and hypo-saline conditions were detrimental to the fitness of T testudinum seedlings. Plants at 0 and 70PSU exhibited 100% mortality and a significant decrease in survival was observed in the 10, 50 and 60PSU treatments. Increased levels of ammonium further decreased growth in the lower salinity treatments. Seedlings in 30 and 40PSU had the greatest growth. Quantum yield and relative electron transport rate, measured using PAM fluorometry, showed a decrease in photosynthetic performance on either side of the 30-40PSU optimum. Tissue osmolality decreased significantly with decreased salinity but tissue remained consistently hyperosinotic to the media across all salinity treatments. Maintaining negative water potential and allocating more energy to osmoregulation may decrease the productivity of this species in salinity-stress conditions. Our results suggest that the salinity-tolerance limits of this seagrass at the seedling stage are not as broad as those reported for mature plants.

The question addressed was how may woody species richness be affected by forest fragment attributes derived from traditional land-use patterns. Species inventories of total woody species, canopy and understorey trees, and shrubs were obtained in 22 forest fragments ( greater than or equal to5 ha). Multiple regression analyses were applied to examine the effects of size, matrix, isolation and shape of the forest fragments on richness of these species guilds. Fragment size was correlated with shape (r = 0.75) and isolation ( r = - 0.69), and isolation was correlated with shape ( r = - 0.75). Total species richness, and number of shrubs and understorey trees in fragments were related to isolation; moreover, additive effects of fragment shape were found for shrubs. The number of canopy species was not related to any fragment variable. Matrix did not help to explain species richness, possibly due to the landscape structure created by the traditional land-use patterns. In addition to size and isolation, we point out the need of considering shape and matrix as additional fragmentation attributes, along with social and economic factors, if we are ever going to be successful in our management and conservation actions.",24,2004,13,5,867,884"Schneider, SH; Root, TL",Ecological implications of climate change will include surprises,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,Article,"In addition to assessing the impacts of CO2 doubling on environment and society, more consideration is needed to estimate extreme events or 'surprises'. This is particularly important at the intersection of disciplines like climate and ecology because the potential for large discontinuities is high given all the possible climate/biota interactions. The vast disparities in scales encountered by those working in traditional ecology (typically 20 m) and climatology (typically 200 km) make diagnoses of such interactions difficult, but these can be addressed by an emerging research paradigm we call strategic cyclical scaling (SCS). The need to anticipate outlier events and assign them subjective probabilities suggests emphasis on interdisciplinary research associations. The desire to reduce societal vulnerability to such events suggests the need to build adaptive management and diverse economic activities into social organizations. The effectiveness of adaptation responses to anticipated climatic changes is complicated when consideration of transient changes, regional disturbances, large unforseeable natural fluctuations and surprises are considered.

Degradation of freshwater ecosystems is a major concern worldwide. Agriculture introduces multiple stressors to streams, presenting a challenge for freshwater managers who must understand the relative strengths of individual stressor effects and their combined multiple-stressor effects. 2. Using a replicated regression design, we manipulated levels of fine sediment and nutrients to create a broad eight-point gradient for each stressor across 128 stream mesocosms to determine the shapes of macroinvertebrate responses after 21 days of exposure. 3. Subsidystress response patterns occurred along both stressor gradients. Sediment addition provided an initial subsidy for some pollution-tolerant taxa and total macroinvertebrate density, but produced consistently negative effects for other taxa, total taxon richness and the density and richness of pollution-sensitive Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera (EPT) taxa. Nutrient enrichment provided an initial subsidy for densities of two common EPT taxa, total EPT density, macroinvertebrate and EPT taxon richness. 4. Few macroinvertebrate variables were affected by a single stressor (always fine sediment). The majority of responses were additive multiple-stressor patterns, although Chironomidae density and EPT taxon richness followed complex synergistic patterns. 5. Fine sediment was a much more pervasive stressor than augmented nutrient concentrations. Overall, macroinvertebrate traits responded to stressors as strongly as community variables or individual taxa. 6. Synthesis and applications. Managing both fine sediment and nutrient inputs from agriculture is crucial to achieve good stream condition but priority should be given to minimizing fine sediment, which should be maintained below a threshold of 5% cover and 0.5-mm depth. Managers also need to be wary of interactive multiple-stressor effects because ecological outcomes of an increase in stressor load may be worse than predicted based on the knowledge of single-stressor effects.",23,2012,49,4,892,902"Neumann, W; Ericsson, G; Dettki, H; Bunnefeld, N; Keuler, NS; Helmers, DP; Radeloff, VC",Difference in spatiotemporal patterns of wildlife road-crossings and wildlife-vehicle collisions,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,Article,"Human-wildlife conflicts like wildlife-vehicle collisions pose major challenges for the management and conservation of mobile wildlife in human-dominated landscapes, particularly when large species are involved. Mitigation measures to reduce risk of collisions may be based on information given by wildlife movement and collision data. To test whether movement and collision data indicate different spatiotemporal risk zones, we predicted year-around probabilities of road-crossings of GPS-marked female moose (Alces alces) (n = 102), and compared them with spatiotemporal patterns of police recorded moose-vehicle collisions (n = 1158). Probability of moose road-crossings peaked in May, June, and between mid November and the beginning of January, i.e. during moose migration. Moose-vehicle collisions were more likely during autumn and winter. Comparing environmental attributes of crossing and collision sites showed significant differences. The likelihood of collisions increased with the abundance of human-modified areas and higher allowed speed, and was lower on forest roads. We found that animal movement data alone are insufficient to predict collision risk zones, while analyses of collision data alone overestimate the collision risk in certain habitats. Our findings suggest that higher collision risk is largely due to low light and poor road surface conditions rather than to more animal road-crossings. This suggests that efforts to reduce wildlife collisions should focus on driver attitudes and road conditions rather than animal movement, and any efforts to model the collision risk will require actual collision data, and not just movement data.

Our results show that carbaryl selection led to rapid evolution of carbaryl resistance with seemingly no cost when assessed in a benign environment. However, carbaryl-resistant populations were more susceptible to parasite infection than control populations.

Seasonal temperature acclimation of R was marked, as illustrated by: (1) a downward shift in daily temperature response curves of R in summer (relative to spring); (2)approximate to 60% lower R measured at 20oC (R-20) in summer compared with spring; and (3) homeostasis over 12 months of R measured at prevailing nighttime temperatures.

Droughts occurred during two of the four years of the study, and we found that higher light levels were generally associated with decreased plant richness in drought years but increased plant richness in wet years.

Here we analysed recent vegetation dynamics (1957-98) in a northern, semi-arid area of the Mediterranean region: the Middle Ebro Valley. Centuries of timber harvesting, cropping and grazing in this region have produced a highly fragmented landscape. Recently, socio-economic changes have led to intensified use of productive areas. Traditional land use in marginal areas has been abandoned. In this study, we examined the main factors related to vegetation recovery in a fragmented, semi and landscape. We used aerial photographs from 1957 and 1998 to produce vegetation maps. A transition matrix showed that vegetation recovery was very scarce. Generalized additive models (GAM) and generalized linear models (GLM) were used to study the relationships between vegetation dynamics, fragmentation, water availability, present land use and land use changes in the area. We found a strong negative relationship between distance from seed or propagule source and vegetation recovery. This indicates that fragmentation contributes to limiting recovery. In addition, we observed that aridity limited vegetation recovery. However, current land use and topography showed weaker relationships with vegetation recovery than those reported in other Mediterranean and semi-arid landscapes. We conclude that fragmentation and aridity are the main determinants of vegetation recovery in the Middle Ebro Valley, white current land use plays a secondary role.

However, if such long-term genetic constraints do exist, they must be due to underlying pleiotropy such that alleles that confer high performance in one environment invariably confer low performance in another. The distribution of genetic correlations within and among populations can provide insight about the existence of such pleiotropic tradeoffs. The long-term association of certain teleost fish taxa with particular abiotic environments suggests that tradeoffs in performance across environments have constrained the geographic distribution of those taxa. Here we report the results of an experiment in which we artificially selected on acute heat- and cold-stress tolerance in two stocks of the poeciliid fish Heterandria formosa from source populations with different thermal histories. Unexpectedly, we observed no direct responses to selection. Under certain conditions, fish from the different source populations differed significantly in cold tolerance, but not in heat tolerance.

Chronic (6-wk) exposure to sublethal Cu and subsequent subjection to temperature and salinity stress had no significant effect on survival under aerial exposure at either 6 or 15-degrees-C. Compared with virtually 100% survival observed in Cu-free animals under normoxia, both 200 ppb Cu and anoxia (singly) drastically decreased survival, which further deteriorated when the animals were subjected to both stresses combined, high temperature or low salinity.

We provide the first experimental test of this hypothesis with the amphipod Corophium volutator. Amphipods were exposed to two test sediments, one with relatively high metals concentrations (Sigma(metals) 239 mg kg(-1)) and a reference sediment with lower contamination (Sigma(metals) 82 mg kg(-1)) under conditions that mimic current and projected conditions of OA (390-1140 mu atm pCO(2)). Survival and DNA damage was measured in the amphipods, whereas the flux of labile metals was measured in the sediment and water column (WC) using Diffusive Gradients in Thin-films. The contaminated sediments became more acutely toxic to C. volutator under elevated pCO(2) (1140 mu atm). There was also a 2.7-fold increase in DNA damage in amphipods exposed to the contaminated sediment at 750 mu atm pCO(2), as well as increased DNA damage in organisms exposed to the reference sediment, but only at 1140 mu atm pCO(2). The projected pCO(2) concentrations increased the flux of nickel and zinc to labile states in the WC and pore water. However, the increase in metal flux at elevated pCO(2) was equal between the reference and contaminated sediments or, occasionally, greater from reference sediments. Hence, the toxicological interaction between OA and contaminants could not be explained by effects of pH on metal speciation. We propose that the additive physiological effects of OA and contaminants will be more important than changes in metal speciation in determining the responses of benthos to contaminated sediments under OA. Our data demonstrate clear potential for near-future OA to increase the susceptibility of benthic ecosystems to contaminants. Environmental policy should consider contaminants within the context of changing environmental conditions.

The loss of sugar kelp was most severe in the Skagerrak region, and a comparison with earlier studies supported the observed changes in the community structure and regional differences between the Skagerrak region and the west coast. Filamentous red algae dominated the sublittoral communities at the Skagerrak coast, whereas coarsely branched and filamentous brown algae were most abundant at the west coast sites with low or no abundance of sugar kelp. The cause of this large-scale shift is not clear, but our observations suggest eutrophication (nutrient and particle pollution) and climate change (increase in temperature) as the two main drivers synergistically contributing, alongside other factors, to the demise of S. latissima.

Is the strength of the relationship between species distribution and environment stronger in some disturbance-response types than in others? Location: California southwest ecoregion, USA. Methods: We developed species distribution models (SDMs) for 45 plant species using three primary modeling methods (GLMs, GAMs, and Random Forests). Using AUC as a performance measure of prediction accuracy, and measure of the strength of species-environment correlations, we used regression analyses to compare the effects of fire disturbance response type, longevity, dispersal mechanism, range size, cover, species prevalence, and model type. Results: Fire disturbance response type explained more variation in model performance than any other variable, but other species and range characteristics were also significant. Differences in prediction accuracy reflected variation in species life history, disturbance response, and rarity. AUC was significantly higher for longer-lived species, found at intermediate levels of abundance, and smaller range sizes. Models performed better for shrubs than sub-shrubs and perennial herbs. The disturbance response type with the highest SDM accuracy was obligate-seeding shrubs with ballistic dispersal that regenerate via fire-cued germination from a dormant seed bank. Conclusions: The effect of species characteristics on predictability of species distributions overrides any differences in modeling technique. Prediction accuracy may be related to how a suite of species characteristics co-varies along environmental gradients.

We investigated if the identity of neighbour species affects these litter-mixing effects. To achieve this, we compared decomposition rates in monoculture and in all possible two-species combinations of eight tree species, widely differing in litter chemistry, set out in two contrasting New Zealand forest types. Litter from the mixed-species litter bags was separated into its component species, which allowed us to quantify the importance of litter-mixing effects and neighbour identity, relative to the effects of species identity, litter chemistry and litter incubation environment. Controlling factors on litter decomposition rate decreased in importance in the order: species identity (litter quality) >> forest type >> neighbour species. Species identity had the strongest influence on decomposition rate. Interspecific differences in initial litter lignin concentration explained a large proportion of the interspecific differences in litter decomposition rate. Litter mass loss was higher and litter-mixture effects were stronger on the younger, more fertile alluvial soils than on the older, less-fertile marine terrace soils. Litter-mixture effects only shifted percentage mass loss within the range of 1.5%. There was no evidence that certain litter mixtures consistently showed interactive effects. Contrary to common theory, adding a relatively fast-decomposing species generally slowed down the decomposition of the slower decomposing species in the mixture. This study shows that: (1) species identity, litter chemistry and forest type are quantitatively the most important drivers of litter decomposition in a New Zealand rain forest; (2) litter-mixture effects-although statistically significant-are far less important and hardly depend on the identity and the chemical characteristics of the neighbour species; (3) additive effects predominate in this ecosystem, so that mass dynamics of the mixtures can be predicted from the monocultures.",22,2010,162,2,479,489"Szuroczki, D; Richardson, JML",The role of trematode parasites in larval anuran communities: an aquatic ecologist's guide to the major players,OECOLOGIA,Review,"Conservation strategies depend on our understanding of the ecosystem and community dynamics.

Senescence is intimately connected with physiological state, which is affected by the environment. Two aspects of the environment - stress and caloric intake - are investigated in the context of senescence, particularly in the context of repair of damage caused by endogenous and exogenous stressors. 2. In a simple life-history model, the organism is characterized by size (affecting reproductive success) and accumulated damage (affecting survival) at age. The modelled organism experiences an imprinting period, at the end of which it estimates the level of food and damaging sources in the environment. From those, an optimal life history is determined, assuming that reproduction is an allometric function of size. 3. The optimal life history involves a behavioural trait (intensity of foraging) and an allocation process (amount of energy allocated to repair of damage). Subsequent to the imprinting period, the organism lives experiencing levels of stress or caloric intake that differ from those during the imprinting period. The mismatch is such that either the caloric intake is greater post-imprinting than during imprinting or environmental stress is smaller post-imprinting that during imprinting. 4. Since reproduction is given allometrically and the organism cannot shrink, there is no reproductive senescence. In all cases, mortality increases with age. Senescence is caused by accumulated damage and we focus on the allocation of potential growth to repair and environmental mismatch. 5. In the case of stress mismatch, the general qualitative result is that both the optimal level of activity and the allocation to repair are greater than their values in the case of no mismatch and they are positively correlated. For caloric mismatch, during the post-imprinting period the intensity of foraging is greater than that predicted if there were no mismatches. However, we predict either a negative correlation between genes characterizing activity and repair (for small mismatch), no correlation (for moderate mismatch) or positive correlation (for large mismatch). Furthermore, caloric mismatch is predicted to lead to a considerable reduction in lifetime reproduction, but stress mismatch is predicted to induce an increase in stress resistance throughout life with little cost to lifetime reproduction.",22,2008,22,3,422,430"Gonzalez, WL; Negritto, MA; Suarez, LH; Gianoli, E",Induction of glandular and non-glandular trichomes by damage in leaves of Madia sativa under contrasting water regimes,ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Article,"Plant traits may play multiple functional roles simultaneously. Leaf trichomes have been related to resistance against herbivores as well as to enhanced water economy in the plant. In a greenhouse study, we evaluated the interactive effect of damage (control vs. mechanical damage) and water availability (control vs. low watering) on the expression of glandular and non-glandular leaf trichomes in the annual Chilean tarweed Madia sativa (Asteraceae). We found that the overall trichome density increased both after damage and when plants were grown under water shortage. Interestingly, the type of trichome induced after damage varied with each water environment. While damage induced glandular trichomes only under control watering, non-glandular trichomes were induced by damage only under experimental drought. Results indicate that in M. sativa glandular trichomes are equally induced by drought or damage but there is no additive effect of these factors. In both cases glandular trichome density apparently reached a limit, which may be interpreted in terms of constraint or efficacy. On the other hand, the synergistic effect of damage and drought on non-glandular trichomes might suggest that, compared to glandular ones, these trichomes are less responsive to each stress factor separately. Thus, for plants to induce non-glandular trichomes they must be subjected to a degree of stress above a threshold that was not reached for each individual factor in our experimental setting. We did not detect a significant correlation between trichome types. Thus, the contrasting patterns observed likely reflect independent responses of trichomes to the evaluated factors.

Due to their life history strategies, marine invertebrates are unable to avoid stress and must adapt to variable environments. We examined the genetic basis of pollution resistance across multiple environments using the marine invertebrate, Styela plicata. Gametes were crossed in a quantitative genetic breeding design to enable partitioning of additive genetic variance across a concentration gradient of a common marine pollutant, copper. Hatching success was scored as a measure of stress resistance in copper concentrations of 0, 75, 150, and 350 mu g/L. There was a significant genotype 3 environment interaction in hatching success across copper concentrations. Further analysis using factor analytic modeling confirmed a significant dimension of across-environment genetic variation where the genetic basis of resistance to stress in the first three environments differed from that in the environment of highest copper concentration. A second genetic dimension further differentiated between the genetic basis of resistance to low and high stress environments. These results suggest that marine organisms use different genetic mechanisms to adapt to different levels of pollution and that the level of genetic variation to adapt to intense pollution stresses may be limited.",22,2007,17,8,2290,2297"Kinezaki, N; Kawasaki, K; Shigesada, N",Spatial dynamics of invasion in sinusoidally varying environments,POPULATION ECOLOGY,Article; Proceedings Paper,"Range expansions of invading species in homogeneous environments have been extensively studied since the pioneer works by Fisher (Ann Eugen 7:255-369, 1937) and Skellam (Biometrika 38:196-218, 1951). However, environments for living organisms are often fragmented by natural or artificial habitat destruction. Here we address how such environmental heterogeneity affects the range expansion of invading species. We consider a single-species invasion in heterogeneous environments whose habitat parameters vary in a sinusoidal or quasi-sinusoidal manner. Accordingly, Fisher's model is modified to make the intrinsic growth rate and diffusion coefficient spatially variable. By numerically solving the model, we examine the spatio-temporal pattern of propagating waves, and predict the speed as a function of the amplitude and the wave length of the diffusion coefficient and the intrinsic growth rate. Firstly, the results demonstrate that in the sinusoidally varying environment, if the intrinsic growth rate solely oscillates, the speed increases with increases in the amplitude of oscillation. Conversely, if the diffusion coefficient solely oscillates, the speed decreases with increases in the amplitude of oscillation. When both the intrinsic growth rate and diffusion coefficient oscillate, the speed is synergistically accelerated if the oscillations are in anti-phase, whereas it is decelerated if the oscillations are in same phase. Secondly, the increase in the wave length in either the intrinsic growth rate or the diffusion coefficient leads to decreases in the speed. Thirdly, in the irregularly varying environment, the irregularity in the amplitude of the intrinsic growth rate enhances the speed, while that of the diffusion coefficient attenuates the speed.",22,2006,48,4,263,270"Joern, A; Mole, S","The plant stress hypothesis and variable responses by blue grama grass (Bouteloua gracilis) to water, mineral nitrogen, and insect herbivory",JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY,Article,"Acting simultaneously or sequentially, plants encounter multiple stresses from combined abiotic and biotic factors that result in decreased growth and internal reallocation of resources. The plant stress hypothesis predicts that environmental stresses on plants decrease plant resistance to insect herbivory by altering biochemical source-sink relationships and foliar chemistry, leading to more palatable food. Such changes in the nutritional landscape for insects may facilitate insect population outbreaks during periods of moderate stress on host plants. We examined the plant stress hypothesis with field experiments in continental grassland (USA) using the C-4 grass Bouteloua gracilis. Water, nitrogen fertilizer, and herbivory from the grass-feeding grasshopper Ageneotettix deorum were manipulated. Combined stresses from water and mineral-N in the soil decreased plant growth and altered foliar percent total N (TN) and percent total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) concentrations in an additive fashion. Grasshopper herbivory affected final biomass only in dry years; plants compensated for tissue loss when rainfall was abundant. Foliar TN and TNC concentrations were dynamic with respect to variable climatic conditions and treatment combinations, showing significant interactions. Grasshopper herbivory had its greatest impact on TN or TNC in dry years, interacting with other forms of stress. Herbivory as a single factor had strong effects on TNC in years with normal precipitation, but not in a dry year.

To study the separate and dual effects of WSF and UVBR, 12 microcosms (9 1) were immersed in the water column of larger mesocosms (polyethylene bags; 1800 1), providing 4 treatments, each in triplicate: (1) NUVBR + WSF (natural UVBR with WSF), (2) HUVBR + WSF (enhanced UVBR with WSF), (3) NUVBR (natural UVBR without WSF), and (4) HUVBR (enhanced UVBR without WSF). During 5 d we monitored the incident radiation, WSF and nutrient concentrations, abundance and production of heterotrophic bacteria and phytoplankton. Strong deleterious effects of WSF and lower effects of UVBR were observed on the phytoplankton assemblage, with d decrease in growth rates accompanied by an increase in mean cell size which reflected a perturbation of the cell division cycle. Using the NUVBR treatement as reference conditions, the above effects resulted in d reduction of 84, 79 and 60% of total abundance of the phytoplankton fraction < 20 mu m in the HUVBR + WSF, NUVBR + WSF and HUVBR treatments, respectively. Significant higher values of bacterial abundances were observed in the WSF-added treatments compared to NUVBR without WSF. However, bacterial thymidine incorporation exhibited diel variations, suggesting cumulative UVBR-induced DNA and/or PAH-induced DNA damages, and possible repair mechanisms with the co-occurrence of more available growth substrates from stressed phytoplankton. The absence of significant differences between both WSF-added treatments under the 2 different UVBR conditions suggests that there is no additive interaction between WSF and UVBR.

The plans were evaluated for the Blue Riverwatershed in the Cascade Range of Oregon, USA. We used two model types: logistic regression and an ecological neighborhood model using a form of nonparametric regression (SpOcc; Species Occurrence Modeler). Both logistic regression and SpOcc successfully estimated the occurrence of the lichen Lobaria oregana in the current landscape, based on elevation and structural classes of forests. Structural classes were defined by combinations of (1) overstory retention of remnant trees, (2) young cohort age, and (3) stream position (upland vs. riparian). Lobaria oregana rapidly diminished in frequency in the landscape at elevations above 900-1000 in. Young, even-aged stands had little or no Lobaria oregana. Most of the other structural classes, however, were very similar in frequency of Lobaria. The differences in lichens between retention levels and between mature and old growth stands were very small compared to the differences with respect to elevation and clearcutting. Similar results, with varying importances of elevation and forest structure, were, obtained for most of the 20 species with the strongest models. Many of these species were associated with old growth, and many were forecasted to be more frequent under either management plan than in the current landscape. This is a likely response to the reduction of even-aged management in this, landscape. We recommend using SpOcc for flexible nonparametric fitting of,species relationships to a multivariate habitat.

Concepts of ecosystem stability, resilience and resistance have been discussed theoretically for nearly three decades. Understanding the effects of habitat disturbance and mechanisms of recovery in practice are vital for successful conservation management and restoration, particularly of subseral communities with high conservation interest and sites subject to unavoidable disturbances. Chalk grasslands are one such habitat, with high European conservation importance, and the greatest remaining extent in north-west Europe lies within the Salisbury Plain Training Area (SPTA), the largest UK military training area. In order to understand the resistance and recovery of this habitat type, we undertook an experimental approach using imposed disturbance treatments. 2. An experiment was designed to compare the disturbance effects of a Land Rover, a truck and a Challenger II tank on a tall Bromopsis erecta -dominated chalk grassland community on the SPTA. Permanent quadrats were established on a site experimentally disturbed by single and multiple passes of the three vehicles and a tank turn (slew). Post-disturbance changes were recorded in the vegetation and soils in permanent quadrats. 3. One year after the disturbance, all the treatments still had significant soil compaction effects and all treatments except the single Land Rover pass resulted in a significant reduction in sward height. The grassland community sampled was significantly less resistant to disturbance by tracked vehicles than wheeled vehicle disturbance, with tracked vehicles creating the greatest recorded soil compaction and exposure of bare soil and longer-term changes in sward composition. 4. Ordination techniques were used to characterize post-disturbance successional trajectories. These suggest that chalk grassland is significantly less resistant to disturbance caused by multiple passes of tracked vehicles and tracked vehicle turns. Chalk grassland recovery from these types of disturbance is less predictable. 5. Identifying vegetation community resistance assists understanding of the ecosystem response to long-term and cumulative stress and facilitates strategic management of habitats where disturbance events are commonplace, especially in areas of high nature conservation interest. These data demonstrate that small-scale but acute disturbance events can have significant effects on plant community composition, and can have wider reaching impacts on other aspects of site management. There are important implications for the management of off-road vehicles in recreational and agricultural contexts, and for the formulation of a strategic sustainable management plan for the SPTA that incorporates both military and conservation objectives. 6. Synthesis and applications. Resistance to disturbance is not necessarily an additive function. Managers of chalk grasslands should limit activities that create high intensity disturbance events because the succession trajectory following such events may be less direct and with less predictable outcomes than that following lower intensity disturbances. Increased predictability of succession trajectories following medium to low disturbance events means these types of disturbance might be used deliberately to create short-term and small-scale heterogeneity in both species composition and sward structure. Site managers should be aware that certain activities not previously considered to be potentially damaging might be creating significant habitat disturbance effects, as changes to soil structure, functioning and fauna can occur in the absence of changes in plant community composition.",22,2003,40,2,368,379"Cudlin, P; Novotny, R; Moravec, I; Chmelikova, E",Retrospective evaluation of the response of montane forest ecosystems to multiple stress,EKOLOGIA-BRATISLAVA,Article,"Montane forests have been under long-term synergistic chronic effects of natural and anthropogenic stress impacts, and imposed from time to time to acute climatic and pollution stress events.

Biomass allocation patterns, clonal dispersal, and competitive success of three salt marsh plant species grown in pots or trays were examined in the greenhouse. The competitive ranking was determined by a pairwise additive-series competition experiment in pots under low nutrient conditions. Competitive ability and patterns of biomass allocation differed significantly among species. The competitive dominant, Juncus gerardi, exhibited higher root:shoot and root:rhizome ratios than its competitive subordinates, Spartina patens and Distichlis spicata. Contrary to what was previously observed in the field, Spartina patens was only slightly competitively superior to Distichlis spicata in the greenhouse (i.e., the difference was not statistically significant). Distichlis spicata and Spartina parens exhibited very similar patterns of biomass allocation, including similar patterns of allocation to roots and rhizomes. Although the ranking of the three species with respect to clonal dispersal rates in trays (i.e., Distichlis spicata > Spartina patens > Juncus gerardi) was inversely correlated with their competitive abilities in the field, differences in dispersal rates were small and not statistically significant. Thus, a hypothesized trade-off between competitive ability and colonization ability in these three species does not appear to be strongly correlated with interspecific differences in rates of clonal dispersal in trays in the greenhouse.

Low tide stress could also play a role in this decline. We performed one mensurative (in situ) and two manipulative (in culture) experiments designed to evaluate the interactive effects of some physical factors. The first experiment analysed field response to low tide stress in marginal (mid-Cantabrian Sea and northern Portugal) versus central (Galicia) populations of F. serratus. Then a second experiment was performed that utilized either harsh or mild summer conditions of atmospheric temperature, irradiance, humidity, and wind velocity to compare the responses of individuals from one marginal and one central population to low tide stress. Finally, the combined effect of sea temperature and the other factors was evaluated to detect interactive effects. Changes in frond growth, maximal photosynthetic quantum yield (F (v)/F (m)), temperature, and desiccation were found. Three additive factors (solar irradiation, ocean and air temperatures) were found to drive F. serratus distribution, except under mildly humid conditions that ameliorated atmospheric thermal stress (two additive factors). Mid-Cantabrian Sea temperatures have recently increased, reaching the inhibitory levels suggested in this study of F. serratus. We also expect an additive secondary contribution of low tide stress to this species decline. On the northern Portugal coast, ocean warming plus low tide stress has not reached this species' inhibition threshold.

Rapid changes in genomic composition and gene expression have been observed in both autopolyploids and allopolyploids, but the effects of polyploidy on proteomic divergence are poorly understood. Here, we report quantitative analysis of protein changes in leaves of Arabidopsis autopolyploids and allotetraploids and their progenitors using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) coupled with mass spectrometry. In more than 1000 proteins analyzed, the levels of protein divergence were relatively high (similar to 18%) between Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis arenosa, relatively low (similar to 6.8%) between an A. thaliana diploid and autotetraploid and intermediate (similar to 8.3 and 8.2%) in F-1- and F-8-resynthesized allotetraploids relative to mid-parent values, respectively. This pattern of proteomic divergence was consistent with the previously reported gene expression data. In particular, many non-additively accumulated proteins (61-62%) in the F-1 and F-8 allotetraploids were also differentially expressed between the parents. The differentially accumulated proteins in functional categories of abiotic and biotic stresses were overrepresented between an A. thaliana autotetraploid and diploid and between two Arabidopsis species, but not significantly different between allotetraploids and their progenitors. Although the trend of changes is similar, the percentage of differentially accumulated proteins that matched previously reported differentially expressed genes was relatively low.

Our aim was to extract major gradients in the distribution of vascular plant species from a grid-based inventory (the German FLORKART data base) and relate them to long-term precipitation and temperature records as well as soil conditions. We present an ordination technique capable of coping with this complex data array. The goal was also to sort out the influence of spatial autocorrelation, assuming floristic autocorrelation is anisotropic. Location Germany, at a spatial resolution of 6' x 10'. Methods Isometric feature mapping (Isomap) was applied as a nonlinear ordination method. Isomap was coupled to 'eigenvector-based filters' for generating spatial reference models representing spatial autocorrelation. What is novel here is that the derived filters are not based on the assumption of equidirectional autocorrelation. Instead, the so-called 'principal coordinates of anisotropic neighbour matrices' build filters to test the influence of geographical vicinity in directions of high similarity among observations. Results The Isomap ordination of floristic data explained more than 95% of the data variance in six dimensions. The leading two dimensions (representing about 80% of the FLORKART data variance) revealed clear spatial gradients that could be related to independent effects of temperature, precipitation and soil observations. By contrast, the third and higher FLORKART dimensions were dominated by an antagonism of anisotropic spatial autocorrelation and soil conditions. A subsequent cluster analysis of the floristic Isomap coordinates educed the spatial organization of the floristic survey, indicating a considerable sampling bias. Conclusions We showed that Isomap provides a consistent methodical framework for both ordination and derived spatial filters. The technique is useful for tracing the often nonlinear features of species occurrence data to environmental drivers, taking into account anisotropic spatial autocorrelation. We also showed that sampling biases are a conspicuous source of variance in a frequently used floristic data base.",21,2008,17,2,284,296"Torregiani, JH; Lesser, MP",The effects of short-term exposures to ultraviolet radiation in the Hawaiian coral Montipora verrucosa,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,Article,"Exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR, 290-400 nm) is an important abiotic factor that tropical marine organisms have been exposed to over evolutionary time. Additionally, UVR is known to cause coral bleaching independently and is an important synergistic factor in bleaching caused by thermal stress. Corals can avoid some of the damage associated with exposure to UVR by producing LTVR-absorbing compounds such as mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs). To examine the role of MAAs in the UVR photobiology of corals we conducted experiments on the Hawaiian coral Montipora verrucosa. M. verrucosa colonies were collected from 1, 5 and 10 m and exposed to three different UVR treatments for 3 days under constant visible irradiances equivalent to a depth of 0.15 m depth in Kane'ohe Bay. In addition to quantifying the MAA concentration of these corals several types of UVR-induced damage were measured to assess whether MAAs were providing protection. Quantum yields of photosystem II (PSII) fluorescence and excitation pressure on PSII were measured for each coral, and the formation of direct UVR damage to DNA was measured as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and (6-4) pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts for the holobiont. All corals exhibited midday depressions in quantum yields, developed DNA photoproducts, and increased their MAA concentrations significantly as a result of UVR exposures. CPD accumulation in M. verrucosa was highest in corals from I m, which had the lowest MAA concentrations at the end of the experiment. Corals originally from 10 m showed the highest MAA concentration and lowest DNA damage in response to exposure to UVR. While corals from all collection depths displayed some sensitivity to increased irradiances of UVR, their respective levels of tolerance were clearly dependant on their previous light history.

Cold-adapted (13 degrees C) populations evolved longer development times and showed lower survival at the highest developmental temperature. No divergence for wing size was detected following adaptation to temperature extremes (13 and 22 degrees C), in agreement with earlier observations, but wing shape changes were obvious as a result of both thermal adaptation and development at different temperatures. However, the evolutionary trends observed for the wing-aspect ratio were inconsistent with an adaptive hypothesis. There was some indication that wing shape asymmetry has evolutionarily increased in warm-adapted populations, which suggests that there is additive genetic variation for fluctuating asymmetry and that it can evolve under rapid environmental changes caused by thermal stress.

Using several data sets, I examine the role of these factors in non-native species richness of several animal groups: birds, mammals and herptiles (amphibians, reptiles). I also examine if non-native species richness is correlated among these groups. I find, in agreement with Sax [2001, Journal of Biogeography 28: 139-150], that latitude is inversely correlated with non-native species richness of many groups. Once latitude is accounted for, area, human population size and native plant species richness are shown to be important extrinsic factors influencing non-native animal species. Of these extrinsic factors, human population size and native plant species richness are the best predictors of non-native animal species richness. Area, human population size and native plant species richness are highly intercorrelated, along with non-native species richness of all taxa. Indeed a factor analysis shows that a single multivariate axis explains over half of the variation for all variables among the groups. One reason for this covariation is that humans tend to most densely occupy the most productive and diverse habitats where native plant species richness is very high. It is thus difficult to disentangle the effects of human population size and native species richness on non-native species richness. However, it seems likely that these two factors may combine to increase non-native species richness in a synergistic way: high native species richness reflects greater habitat variety available for non-native species, and dense human populations (that preferentially occupy areas rich in native species) increase non-native species importation and disturbance of local habitats.",21,2006,8,3,415,425"Hooper, HL; Sibly, RM; Maund, SJ; Hutchinson, TH",The joint effects of larval density and C-14-cypermethrin on the life history and population growth rate of the midge Chironomus riparius,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,Article,"1. Chemical effects on organisms are typically assessed using individual-level endpoints or sometimes population growth rate (PGR), but such measurements are generally made at low population densities. In contrast most natural populations are subject to density dependence and fluctuate around the environmental carrying capacity as a result of individual competition for resources. As ecotoxicology aims to make reliable population projections of chemical impacts in the field, an understanding of how high-density or resource-limited populations respond to environmental chemicals is essential. 2. Our objective was to determine the joint effects of population density and chemical stress on the life history and PGR of an important ecotoxicological indicator species, Chironomus riparius, under controlled laboratory conditions. Populations were fed the same ration but initiated at different densities and exposed to a solvent control and three concentrations of C-14-cypermethrin in a sediment-water test system for 67 days at 20 +/- 1 degreesC. 3. Density had a negative effect on all the measured life-history traits, and PGR declined with increasing density in the controls. Exposure to C-14-cypermethrin had a direct negative effect on juvenile survival, presumably within the first 24 h because the chemical rapidly dissipated from the water column. Reductions in the initial larval densities resulted in an increase in the available resources for the survivors. Subsequently, exposed populations emerged sooner and started producing offspring earlier than the controls. C-14-cypermethrin had no effect on estimated fecundity and adult body weight but interacted with density to reduce the time to first emergence and first reproduction. As a result, PGR increased with cypermethrin concentration when populations were initiated at high densities. 4. Synthesis and applications. The results showed that the effects of C-14-cypermethrin were buffered at high density, so that the joint effects of density and chemical stress on PGR were less than additive. Low levels of chemical stressors may increase carrying capacity by reducing juvenile competition for resources. More and perhaps fitter adults may be produced, similar to the effects of predators and culling; however, toxicant exposure may result in survivors that are less tolerant to changing conditions. If less than additive effects are typical in the field, standard regulatory tests carried out at low density may overestimate the effects of environmental chemicals.

The additive genetic variance for development time in each population was not associated with latitude but was associated with the population mean development time.

Plant communities often exhibit rapidly saturating or even hump-shaped age-flammability trajectories and landscapes often display strong non-linear behaviors, abrupt shifts, and self-reinforcing alternative community states. This plethora of fire-landscape interactions calls for a more general model that considers alternative age-flammability rules. We simulated landscape dynamics assuming communities that (1) increase in flammability with age and (2) gain flammability up to a certain age followed by a slight and moderate loss to a constant value. Simulations were run under combinations of ignition frequency and interannual climatic variability. Age-increasing fire probability promoted high resilience to changes in ignition frequency and climatic variability whereas humpbacked-shaped age-flammability led to strong non-linear behaviors. Moderate (20%) reductions in mature compared to peak flammability produced the least resilient behaviors. The relatively nonflammable mature forest matrix intersected by young flammable patches is prone to break up and disintegrate with slight increases in ignition/climate variability causing large-scale shifts in the fire regime because large fires were able to sweep through the more continuous young/flammable landscape. Contrary to the dominant perception, fire suppression in landscapes with positive feedbacks may effectively reduce fire occurrence by allowing less flammable later stage communities composed of longer lived, obligate seeders to replace earlier stages of light demanding, often more flammable resprouters. Conversely, increases in anthropogenic ignitions, a common global trend of many forested regions may, in synergism with increased climate variability, induce abrupt shifts, and large-scale forest degradation.",20,2012,15,1,97,112"Carboni, M; Thuiller, W; Izzi, F; Acosta, A",Disentangling the relative effects of environmental versus human factors on the abundance of native and alien plant species in Mediterranean sandy shores,DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,Article,"Aim Mediterranean coastal sand dunes are characterized by both very stressful environmental conditions and intense human pressure. This work aims to separate the relative contributions of environmental and human factors in determining the presence/abundance of native and alien plant species in such an extreme environment at a regional scale. Location 250 km of the Italian Tyrrhenian coast (Region Lazio). Methods We analysed alien and native plant richness and fitted generalized additive models in a multimodel-inference framework with comprehensive randomizations to evaluate the relative contribution of environmental and human correlates in explaining the observed patterns. Results Native and alien richness are positively correlated, but different variables influence their spatial patterns. For natives, human population density is the most important factor and is negatively related to richness. Numbers of natives are unexpectedly lower in areas with a high proportion of natural land cover (probably attributable to local farming practices) and, to a lesser degree, affected by the movement of the coastline. On the other hand, alien species richness is strongly related to climatic factors, and more aliens are found in sectors with high rainfall. Secondarily, alien introductions appear to be related to recent urban sprawl and associated gardening. Main conclusions Well-adapted native species in a fragile equilibrium with their natural environment are extremely sensitive to human-driven modifications. On the contrary, for more generalist alien species, the availability of limited resources plays a predominant role.",20,2010,16,4,537,546"Duman, F; Ozturk, F; Aydin, Z",Biological responses of duckweed (Lemna minor L.) exposed to the inorganic arsenic species As(III) and As(V): effects of concentration and duration of exposure,ECOTOXICOLOGY,Article,"The accumulation of arsenic (As) and physiological responses of Lemna minor L. under different concentration (0, 1, 4, 16 and 64 mu M) and duration (1, 2, 4 and 6 days) of two species As, NaAsO(2) and Na(2)HAsO(4)center dot 7H(2)O, were studied in hydroponics. The accumulation of both As species depended on As concentration and exposure duration. The highest accumulation of As was found as 17408 and 8674 mu g g(-1), for plants exposed to 64 mu M of As(III) and As(V), respectively, after 6 days. Two-way ANOVA analyses indicated that, for plants exposed to arsenite (As(III)), exposure duration had a greater effect than concentration on As accumulation. Conversely, exposure concentration had a greater effect on As accumulation in plants exposed to arsenate (As(V)). Arsenic exposure levels, approaching 16 mu M for As(III) and 64 mu M for As(V), did not significantly affect EC values. Beyond these exposure concentrations, EC values increased in a manner that depended on duration. Significant effect of As(III) on lipid peroxidation was observed at 1 mu M application whereas, this effect started to be significant after an exposure to 16 mu M As(V). For both As(III) and As(V), photosynthetic pigment levels slightly increased for the first day with respect to the control, followed by a gradual decline at higher concentrations and durations. An increase in protein content and enzyme activity was observed at moderate exposure conditions, followed by a decrease. Significant positive correlations were determined between accumulated As and ion leakage and lipid peroxidation. Negative correlations were found between accumulated As and total chlorophyll and protein content.

Time and space restrictions often prevent the assessment of population-level responses to a toxic substance. Contaminants can affect various biological functions (e.g. growth, fecundity or behavior), which may alter different demographic traits, leading to population-level impacts. In this study, immune suppression, reproductive dysfunction and somatic growth impairment were examined using life history matrix models for coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) and Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Our intent was to gauge the relative magnitude of response to toxic effects among species and between life history stages, not provide a specific estimate of population growth rate or abundance. Effects due to immune suppression were modeled as reductions in age-specific survival. Toxic impacts on reproductive function were modeled as a 10% reduction in reproductive contribution for all reproductively mature age groups. Model runs that examined the effect of somatic growth reduction on population parameters incorporated both survival and reproductive impacts. All impacts were modeled as 10% reductions in the affected population demographic parameters. First-year survival and reproductive impacts produced similar population growth rates (lambda), but resulted in different sensitivity and stable age distributions. Modeled somatic growth reduction produced additive effects on survival and reproduction. Toxic stressors producing similar changes in; did not necessarily produce similar changes in the age distributions. Sensitivity and elasticity analyses demonstrated that changes to the first-year survival rate produced the greatest per-unit effect on; for each species. Alteration in abundance of mature females also strongly influenced L Differences observed between species showed that the number of reproductive ages and time to reproductive maturity were important components for population-level responses. These results emphasize the importance of linking toxicity responses at low concentrations to the demographic traits they affect, and help to highlight the toxicity tests that are more suitable for assessing impacts on the focal species. Additionally, life history modeling is a useful tool for developing testable hypotheses regarding impacts on specific populations as well as for conducting comparisons between populations.

Ecosystem alterations can affect the abundance, distribution and diversity of plants and animals, and thus potentially change the relative strength of bottom-up (the plant resource) and top-down (natural enemies) trophic forces acting on herbivore populations. 2. The hypothesis that alterations of the forest ecosystem associated with precommercial thinning have contributed to the increased severity of outbreaks of Neodiprion abietis (Harris), a sawfly defoliator, through the reduction of trophic forces acting on N. abietis larvae, was tested using exclusion techniques. 3. The relative contributions to N. abietis larval mortality of bottom-up and top-down forces both increased with increasing levels of defoliation and were both reduced by thinning. The reduction of bottom-up and top-down forces caused a 58% mean increase in N. abietis larval survival in thinned compared with untreated stands, which is less than would be expected by the sum of the effects of thinning on each source of mortality. Evidence indicates that the partly compensatory, partly additive nature of the mortality associated with trophic forces in the system under study is responsible for this discrepancy. 4. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show the impact of ecosystem alterations on the balance between bottom-up and top-down forces acting on an eruptive herbivore population along a gradient of host-plant defoliation, and how this can lead to increased outbreak severity. It is stressed that accurate estimates of the relative contributions of bottom-up and top-down forces to mortality cannot be obtained if the additive or compensatory nature of the mortality associated with these trophic forces is overlooked.",20,2006,75,4,853,861"Ernoult, A; Tremauville, Y; Cellier, D; Margerie, P; Langlois, E; Alard, D",Potential landscape drivers of biodiversity components in a flood plain: Past or present patterns?,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,Review,"Changes in landscape pattern under the control of agriculture intensification are considered to be an important driver of biodiversity and often a threat for conservation. The response of species to landscape changes is complex, including possible time lags, and depends on the taxonomic group. The search for surrogate species or surrogate data for biodiversity is confronted with this complexity. This study was conducted on two taxonomic groups (birds and vascular plants) for 20 sites each of 1km(2) equally distributed in the Seine valley floodplain. For plants, two habitats were studied: grasslands and hedges. We used a generalised additive model (GAM) and co-inertia analyses to determine whether present or past landscape attributes can best explain the biodiversity components (structure and composition). This study confirms the major role of landscape pattern attributes for predicting some metrics of biodiversity, e.g. species richness. But this study shows that potential drivers of biodiversity come from both the past and present landscape patterns. The quality of surrogates for biodiversity is strongly dependent on understanding the importance of past conditions. This suggests the need for more functional surrogates, taking into account the situation of equilibrium or non-equilibrium between biodiversity and its drivers. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

These events have previously been postulated to have been sole or contributory causes of mass extinctions. Following such events, UV-B radiation would have been elevated at the surface of the earth. The possibilities for detecting elevated UV-B as a kill mechanism in the fossil record are discussed. In the case of impact events and large-scale volcanism, the taxa affected by increases in UV-B radiation are likely to be similar to those affected by cooling and by the initial drop in irradiance caused by stratospheric dust injection. Thus UV-B may synergistically exacerbate the effects of these other environmental changes and contribute to stress in the biosphere, although UV-B alone Is unlikely to cause a mass extinction. By the same token, however, this similarity in affected taxa is likely to make delineating the involvement of UV-B radiation in the fossil record more difficult.

Biotic resistance, the ability of species in a community to limit invasion, is central to our understanding of how communities at risk of invasion assemble after disturbances, but it has yet to translate into guiding principles for the restoration of invasion-resistant plant communities. We combined experimental, functional, and modelling approaches to investigate processes of community assembly contributing to biotic resistance to an introduced lineage of Phragmites australis, a model invasive species in North America. We hypothesized that (i) functional group identity would be a good predictor of biotic resistance to P. australis, while species identity effect would be redundant within functional group (ii) mixtures of species would be more invasion resistant than monocultures. 2. We classified 36 resident wetland plants into four functional groups based on eight functional traits. We conducted two competition experiments based on the additive competition design with P. australis and monocultures or mixtures of wetland plants. As an indicator of biotic resistance, we calculated a relative competition index (RCIavg) based on the average performance of P. australis in competition treatment compared with control. To explain diversity effect further, we partitioned it into selection effect and complementarity effect and tested several diversity-interaction models. 3. In monoculture treatments, RCIavg of wetland plants was significantly different among functional groups, but not within each functional group. We found the highest RCIavg for fast-growing annuals, suggesting priority effect. 4. RCIavg of wetland plants was significantly greater in mixture than in monoculture mainly due to complementarity-diversity effect among functional groups. In diversity-interaction models, species interaction patterns in mixtures were described best by interactions between functional groups when fitted to RCIavg or biomass, implying niche partitioning. 5. Synthesis. Functional group identity and diversity of resident plant communities are good indicators of biotic resistance to invasion by introduced Phragmites australis, suggesting niche pre-emption (priority effect) and niche partitioning (diversity effect) as underlying mechanisms. Guiding principles to understand and/or manage biological invasion could emerge from advances in community theory and the use of a functional framework.

Numerous studies have revealed (usually positive) relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (B-EF), but the underpinning drivers are rarely addressed explicitly, hindering the development of a more predictive understanding. 2. We developed a suite of statistical models (where we combined existing models with novel ones) to test for richness and evenness effects on detrital processing in freshwater microcosms. Instead of using consumer species as biodiversity units, we used two size classes within three species (six types). This allowed us to test for diversity effects and also to focus on the role of body size and biomass. 3. Our statistical models tested for (i) whether performance in polyculture was more than the sum of its parts (non-additive effects), (ii) the effects of specific type combinations (assemblage identity effects) and (iii) whether types behaved differently when their absolute or relative abundances were altered (e. g. because type abundance in polyculture was lower compared with monoculture). The latter point meant we did not need additional density treatments. 4. Process rates were independent of richness and evenness and all types performed in an additive fashion. The performance of a type was mainly driven by the consumers' metabolic requirements (connected to body size). On an assemblage level, biomass explained a large proportion of detrital processing rates. 5. We conclude that B-EF studies would benefit from widening their statistical approaches. Further, they need to consider biomass of species assemblages and whether biomass is comprised of small or large individuals, because even if all species are present in the same biomass, small species (or individuals) will perform better.",19,2011,80,6,1145,1154"Casini, M; Kornilovs, G; Cardinale, M; Mollmann, C; Grygiel, W; Jonsson, P; Raid, T; Flinkman, J; Feldman, V",Spatial and temporal density dependence regulates the condition of central Baltic Sea clupeids: compelling evidence using an extensive international acoustic survey,POPULATION ECOLOGY,Article,"For the first time an international acoustic survey dataset covering three decades was used to investigate the factors shaping the spatial and temporal patterns in the condition of sprat and herring in the Baltic Proper. Generalized additive models showed that the spatial and temporal fluctuations in sprat density have been the main drivers of the spatio-temporal changes of both sprat and herring condition, evidencing intra- and inter-specific density dependence mediated by the size and distribution of the sprat population. Salinity was also an important predictor of herring condition, whereas temperature explained only a minor part of sprat model deviance. Herring density was an additional albeit weak significant predictor for herring condition, evidencing also intra-specific density dependence within the herring population. For both species, condition was high and similar in all areas of the Baltic Proper until the early 1990s, coincident with low sprat densities. Afterwards, a drop in condition occurred and a clear south-north pattern emerged. The drop in condition after the early 1990s was stronger in the northern areas, where sprat population increased the most. We suggest that the increase in sprat density in the northern areas, and the consequent spatial differentiation in clupeid condition, have been triggered by the almost total disappearance of the predator cod from the northern Baltic Proper.

At the same time, increasing fisheries exploitation is impacting on marine ecosystems. Here, using increased benthic-invertebrate mortality as a proxy for effects of ocean acidification, the potential impact of the two stressors of fishing and acidification on the southeast Australian marine ecosystem to year 2050 was explored. The individual and interaction effects of the two stressors on biomass and diversity were examined for the entire ecosystem and for regional assemblages. For 61 functional groups or species, the cumulative effects of moderate ocean acidification and fishing were additive (30%), synergistic (33%), and antagonistic (37%). Strong ocean acidification resulted in additive (22%), synergistic (40%), and antagonistic (38%) effects. The greatest impact was on the demersal food web, with fishing impacting predation and acidification affecting benthic production. Areas that have been subject to intensive fishing were the most susceptible to acidification effect, although fishing also mitigated some of the decline in biodiversity observed with moderate acidification. The model suggested that ocean acidification and long-term fisheries exploitation could act synergistically with the increasing sensitivity to change from long-term (decades) fisheries exploitation potentially causing unexpected restructuring of the pelagic and demersal food webs.

Previous research has shown interactions between hypoxia and some PAHs (fluoranthene, alpha-naphthoflavone) but no interaction with others (benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), beta-naphthoflavone). Here we examine how hypoxia (7.4% oxygen, similar to 35% of normoxia) affects the embryotoxicity of PAHs that act through different mechanisms and the role that CYP1A inhibition may play in these interactions. About 500 mu g/l BaP and 1-200 mu g/l benzo[k]fluoranthene (BkF) interacted synergistically with hypoxia to induce pericardial edema in developing zebrafish (Danio rerio). Hypoxia protected from the embryotoxicity of pyrene (PY) and had no effect on the toxicity of polychlorinated biphenyl-126. Despite previous reports of other CYP1A inhibitors interacting with hypoxia, up to 2,000 mu g/l dibenzothiophene, 2-aminoanthracene (AA), and carbazole (CB) all failed to induce embryotoxicity under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. The toxicity of PAH mixtures-including binary mixtures of BaP/AA and BaP/CB and two environmentally relevant, complex mixtures-were exacerbated severely by hypoxia to induce or worsen pericardial edema and cause mortality. The interactions between hypoxia and BkF and PY were closely mimicked by morpholino knockdown of CYP1A, indicating a potential role for metabolism of these compounds in their toxicity. Our results indicate that various PAHs may exhibit synergistic, antagonistic or additive toxicity with hypoxia. The enhanced toxicity of environmental mixtures of PAHs under hypoxia suggests that risk assessments that do not take into account potential interactions with hypoxia may underestimate the threat of PAHs to fish in contaminated sites.",19,2011,20,6,1300,1314"Trivedi, P; Spann, T; Wang, NA",Isolation and Characterization of Beneficial Bacteria Associated with Citrus Roots in Florida,MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,Article,"Cultivable diversity of bacteria associated with citrus was investigated as part of a larger study to understand the roles of beneficial bacteria and utilize them to increase the productive capacity and sustainability of agro-ecosystems.

Fishing of urchin predators had indirect negative effects on macroalgae, whereas blooms of epi-benthic dinoflagellates (Ostreopsis siamensis) were found to have strong negative effects on urchins and indirect positive effects on macroalgae. Based on these opposing effects, blooms were expected to counteract the cascading effects of fishing. However, a large bloom of Ostreopsis led to greater divergence in macroalgae abundance between reserve and fished sites, as urchins declined at reserve sites but remained stable at fished sites. This resulted from enhanced predation rates on bloom-affected urchins at reserve sites rather than direct lethal effects of Ostreopsis on urchins.

Nutrients also caused an increase in the cover of green filamentous algae, which in turn was synergistically magnified by the removal of grazers. Here we showed that these stressors can individually alter the structure of rock pools assemblages; and that in this system top-down control (by grazers) is more important than bottom-up factors (nutrients) in controlling macroalgal assemblage structure. The combined effect of grazers loss and nutrients was larger than the sum of their individual effects. This study enhanced mechanistic understanding of the impacts of multiple stressors on coastal ecosystems, which will help to develop management strategies and conservation of the marine environment.

Organisms were surveyed for contaminant bioaccumulation and induction of two hepatic biochemical biomarkers: metallothionein (MT) and cytochrome P450 (CYP1A), as potential indicators of exposure to metallic and organic contaminants, respectively. Using an integrative approach it was established that, although bioaccumulation is in general accordance with sediment contamination, lethality and biomarker responses are not linearly dependent of the cumulative concentrations of sediment contaminants but rather of their bioavailability and synergistic effects in organisms.

This paper assesses the influence of climate on the range expansion of this species and highlights the importance of anthropogenic disturbance to its spread. Location Central and Northern Europe. Methods Data on the geographic distribution of L. serriola were assembled through a literature search as well as through floristic and herbarium surveys. Maps of the spread of L. serriola in Central and Northern Europe were prepared based on herbarium data. The spread was assessed more precisely in Germany, Austria and Great Britain by pooling herbarium and literature data. We modelled the bioclimatic niche of the species using occurrence and climatic data covering the last century to generate projections of suitable habitats under the climatic conditions of five time periods. We tested whether the observed distribution of L. serriola could be explained for each time period, assuming that the climatic niche of the species was conserved across time. Results The species has spread northwards since the beginning of the 19th century. We show that climate warming in Europe increased the number of sites suitable for the species at northern latitudes. Until the late 1970s, the distribution of the species corresponded to the climatically suitable sites available. For the last two decades, however, we could not show any significant relationship between the increase in suitable sites and the distributional range change of L. serriola. However, we highlight potential areas the species could spread to in the future (Great Britain, southern Scandinavia and the Swedish coast). It is predominantly non-climatic influences of global change that have contributed to its rapid spread. Main conclusions The observation that colonizing species are not filling their climatically suitable range might imply that, potentially, other ruderal species could expand far beyond their current range. Our work highlights the importance of historical floristic and herbarium data for understanding the expansion of a species. Such historical distributional data can provide valuable information for those planning the management of contemporary environmental problems, such as species responses to environmental change.",19,2009,36,8,1573,1587"Eriksson, BK; Rubach, A; Hillebrand, H",Dominance by a canopy forming seaweed modifies resource and consumer control of bloom-forming macroalgae,OIKOS,Article,"Degradation of ecological resources by large-scale disturbances highlights the need to demonstrate biological properties that increase resistance to change and promote the resilience of ecosystem regimes. Coastal eutrophication is a global-scale disturbance that drives ecosystem change by increasing primary production and favouring ephemeral and bloom-forming life-forms. Recent synthesis indicates that consumption processes increase the resistance of coastal communities to nutrient loading by controlling the responses of ephemeral macroalgae. Here we suggest a similar ecological function for canopy cover by demonstrating that the presence of a canopy species modifies both resource and consumer control of bloom-forming algae associated with nutrient enrichment. We tested effects of canopy presence on the interaction between consumer and resource control, by field-manipulations of a dominant canopy forming seaweed (Fucus vesiculosus), grazer presence (dominated by the gastropod Littorina littorea) and nutrient enrichment (common agricultural NPK fertilizer). Canopy cover and grazers jointly controlled strong increases of ephemeral bloom-forming algae (dominated by Ulva spp) from nutrient enrichment; nutrients increased ephemeral recruitment almost 10-fold, but only in the absence of both grazers and canopy cover. Recruitment success of the canopy-forming seaweed itself decreased additively with 56.1, 71.3 and 50.5% from independent effects of canopy cover, grazers and nutrient enrichment, respectively. A meta-analysis of nine nutrient enrichment experiments including seaweed, seagrass and stream communities, showed that in the presence of canopies average nutrient effects were reduced by more than 90% compared to without canopies. This corroborates the generality of our finding that dominating canopy species are important for aquatic ecosystems by increasing community resistance to the propagation of nutrient effects.",19,2007,116,7,1211,1219"Duriez, O; Eraud, C; Barbraud, C; Ferrand, Y",Factors affecting population dynamics of Eurasian woodcocks wintering in France: assessing the efficiency of a hunting-free reserve,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,Article,"The Eurasian woodcock Scolopax rusticola is a migratory bird of major importance for hunting, which is susceptible to habitat loss and the stochastic effects of severe winter weather. Conservation issues mostly concerned regulation of hunting, but the efficiency of hunting-free reserves has never been investigated. We studied causes of mortality and survival probabilities of 98 radio-tagged woodcocks in a reserve with no hunting and in an adjoining hunting area in Brittany (France). Predation, mostly by mammalian predators on fields at night, was similar among adults and yearlings, while hunting mortality was more important in yearlings. Overall winter survival probabilities were 0.86 +/- SE 0.07 in adults and 0.63 +/- SE 0.07 in yearlings. Survival probabilities of both age classes increased as birds spent more time in the reserve. Equality of predation in both reserve and hunting areas suggests an additive mortality due to hunting over the winter. Population matrix models predicted that such low survival probabilities cannot sustain long term viable populations. These results call for caution in the harvesting of woodcock populations wintering in western France and could be a forewarning of a decline. The regulation of hunting by setting bag limits or reducing the length of shooting seasons, or the creation of reserves might be appropriate tools for the sustainable management of woodcock populations.

However, it is generally unknown whether simultaneous or sequential effects of different forms of disturbance are predictable from the independent effects of each disturbance. This study examines the short-term effects of sequential disturbance by mineral sand-mining followed by fire in a forest community in south-eastern Australia. Four combinations of disturbance were sampled: unburned mined, burned mined, unburned forest (unmined) and burned forest (unmined, with between-fire interval matching the disturbance interval between mining and fire of the burned mined treatment). All combinations were sampled approximately 12 months following fire on the burned sites. The impact of fire after mining depended on disturbance interval. Sites burned 0.5-2.4 years since mining had fewer native vascular plant species than unburned mined sites of the same mined age, whereas sites with 10-16 years or 20-26 years between mining and fire had greater native species richness than unburned mined sites of the same age. Burning 20-26 years after mining brought native species richness within the range of burned forest. For both unmined and mined sites native seedling densities increased with burning, and with longer disturbance intervals. Weed species richness and weed seedling densities were greater on mined sites than in forest, and burning mined sites elevated weed seedling densities further, particularly for short intervals. Both disturbance interval and fire intensity are likely to have contributed to these results, as intensity on mined areas increased with interval, and at 20-26 years post-mining was equivalent to unmined forest. These results suggest that fire could be used to promote rehabilitation of these mined areas after at least 10 years, but should be excluded from earlier stages of post-mining regeneration. However, other sources of spatial and temporal variability should be considered in addition to interval and intensity, as variation among mined areas was correlated with post-fire weather conditions and available weed sources. Finally, the combined effects of mining and fire could not be predicted from knowledge of the disturbances operating separately, indicating that effects of multiple disturbance may be synergistic rather than additive.",19,2004,29,5,508,529"Lawrence, RK; Demarais, S; Relyea, RA; Haskell, SP; Ballard, WB; Clark, TL",Desert mule deer survival in southwest Texas,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,Article,"We studied population structure and limiting factors within a desert mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus eremicus) population in Brewster County of the Trans-Pecos Region in Texas, USA.

Variation in weather patterns (i.e., drought) was associated with-if not causative of-annual variation in survival patterns. Adult female and young survival had the strongest correlation with drought. Pregnancy status of young (less than or equal to1.5 yr) and old (greater than or equal to6.5 yr) deer appeared most affected by drought. Seasonal periods of natural stress differed for adult sex classes, with most female mortalities occurring during months associated with parturition and lactation, and most male natural stress losses occurring during late winter and early spring. The major mortality sources were hunting and natural stressors for adult males, natural stressors and predation for adult females, and predation and natural stressors for young. Subadult mortalities were too few to identify significant mortality agents.

Furthermore, mutation rate may not be constant, and a recent study suggests that mutation rates are higher in mildly stressful environments. If mutation rate is a function of condition, then individuals carrying more mutations will tend to be in worse condition and therefore produce more mutations. Here I examine the mean fitnesses of sexual and asexual populations evolving under such condition-dependent mutation rates. The equilibrium mean fitness of a sexual population depends on the shape of the curve relating fitness to mutation rate. If mutation rate declines synergistically with increasing condition the mean fitness will be much lower than if mutation rate declines at a diminishing rate. In contrast, asexual populations are less affected by condition-dependent mutation rates. The equilibrium mean fitness of an asexual population only depends on the mutation rate of the individuals in the least loaded class. Because such individuals have high fitness and therefore a low mutation rate, asexual populations experience less genetic load than sexual populations, thus increasing the twofold cost of sex.",19,2002,15,6,1004,1010"Takahashi, K; Kohyama, T",Size-structure dynamics of two conifers in relation to understorey dwarf bamboo: A simulation study,JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE,Article,"Size-structure dynamics and co-existence of the conifers Abies sachalinensis and Picea glehnii in subalpine forests in Japan, in relation to the understorey dwarf bamboo Sasa, were examined using a simulation model. This model explicitly incorporated recruitment rate, size growth rate and mortality. Recruitment and growth rates were assumed to be suppressed by the cumulative basal area of taller trees and the density of Sasa. As for the one-sided crowding effect, two types of model were examined. The total basal area of the two species suppresses the growth and recruitment rates in an additive model, while the basal area of each species has a separate effect included in a specific model. Two types of recruitment process were examined, i.e. open and closed systems; recruitment rates of open and closed systems are independent of, and proportional to, the basal area of the same species within the plot, respectively. Parameters were estimated from data of plot censuses for four years. The parameters of the specific model showed that recruitment and size growth rates were more suppressed by the same species than the other species. Recruitment of A. sachalinensis was mon sensitive to suppression by Sasa compared with P. glehnii. The stationary size structure of the two species, generated from both the models with the open system, fitted well to the observed size structures across various Sasa densities. A. sachalinensis and P. glehnii dominated at lower and higher densities of Sasa, respectively. However, the closed-system simulation showed that the stable co-existence of the two species with a good fit to the observed size structure occurred only in the specific model. These results suggest that within-species interference, which is more severe than between-species interference, is important for the co-existence of the two species and that the relative dominance of the two species readily explained the differential responses to Sasa abundance.",19,1999,10,6,833,842"Eeva, T; Lehikoinen, E; Sunell, C",The quality of pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) and great tit (Parus major) females in an air pollution gradient,ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI,Article,"We studied whether pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) and great tit (Parus major) females differed in quality between polluted and unpolluted habitats. Comparing female condition between incubation and nestling periods, we aimed at testing whether biometric differences in F. hypoleuca females were caused by assortative settlement (i.e. intraspecific competition) or as a consequence of breeding in environments exposed to different levels of pollution stress. Body mass, wing length, fat reserves, age distribution, timing of breeding and breeding density of females were measured along an air pollution gradient from a copper smelter in SW Finland in 1991-1994. We found few differences in female quality which could be explained by assortative settling. Females were of the same size in all areas. At nestling time P. major females were heaviest in a moderately polluted area. However, females in the most polluted area were not lighter than those in background areas. Female fat reserves in both species were smaller in the polluted area in one cold breeding season. This suggests that natural (weather) and human induced (pollution) stress factors affected female condition additively. The proportion of young F. hypoleuca females was slightly higher in the polluted area than elsewhere. P. major females started laying earlier near the factory complex than farther away. F. hypoleuca females laid later in the polluted area in early breeding seasons but in late seasons laying started simultaneously everywhere.

Beta diversity patterns are originated from two distinct processes: the replacement (or turnover) of species and the loss (or gain) of species leading to richness differences. Nested distributional patterns are generally thought to have a component deriving from beta diversity which is independent of replacement processes. Quantification of these phenomena is often made by calculating a measure of beta diversity, and the resulting value being subsequently partitioned into a contribution by species replacement plus a fraction shared by beta diversity and nestedness. Three methods have been recently proposed for such partitioning, all of them based on pairwise comparisons of sites. In this paper, the performance of these methods was evaluated on theoretical grounds and tested by a simulation study in which different gradients of dissimilarity, with known degrees of species replacement and species loss, were created. Performance was also tested using empirical data addressing land-use induced changes in endemic arthropod communities of the Terceira Island in the Azores. We found that the partitioning of cc (dissimilarity in terms of the Jaccard index) into two additive fractions, -3 (dissimilarity due to species replacement) plus rich (dissimilarity due to richness differences) reflects the species replacement and species loss processes across the simulated gradients in an ecologically and mathematically meaningful way, whilst the other two methods lack mathematical consistency and prove conceptually self-contradictory. Moreover, the first method identified a selective local extinction process for endemic arthropods, triggered by land-use changes, while the latter two methods overweighted the replacement component and led to false conclusions. Their basic flaw derives from the fact that the proposed replacement and nestedness components (deemed to account for species loss) are not scaled in the same way as the measure that accounts for the total dissimilarity (SOrensen and Jaccard indices). We therefore recommend the use of cc=-3+rich, since its components are scaled in the same units and their responses are proportional to the replacement and the gain/loss of species.",18,2013,122,6,825,834"Coverdale, TC; Herrmann, NC; Altieri, AH; Bertness, MD",Latent impacts: the role of historical human activity in coastal habitat loss,FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT,Article,"Understanding human impacts on ecosystems is critical for conservation, but can be complicated by interactions between multiple impacts occurring at different times. Using historical patterns of ditch construction on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, we tested the hypothesis that mosquito ditches have exacerbated salt marsh die-offs. Ditching activities occurred in the 1930s and were followed by post-World War II shoreline development, which created >90% of current shoreline infrastructure on Cape Cod. Recently, predator depletion caused by recreational fishing has allowed populations of a native herbivorous crab (Sesarrna reticulatum) to increase dramatically, triggering herbivore-driven cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) die-off at developed sites. Depression-era mosquito ditching had little effect for decades, but accelerated subsequent die-offs by expanding cordgrass habitat. Despite occurring decades apart, ditching interacted synergistically with shoreline development and recreational fishing to devastate similar to 55% of low marsh habitat (the narrow band of marsh grass necessary for marsh persistence and expansion). This suggests that historical human impacts can remain dormant for decades before interacting unexpectedly with modern perturbations. Such latent impacts are widespread in both marine and terrestrial habitats and may be common in other ecosystems with a history of disturbance.

Co-adaptation is known to contribute to the resolution of parent-offspring conflict over parental care by selecting for combinations of offspring demand and parental supply that match to maximize the fitness of family members. However, multiple paternity and differences in the level of care provided by mothers and fathers can generate antagonistic selection on offspring demand (mediated, for example, by genomic imprinting) and possibly hamper co-adaptation. While parent-offspring co-adaptation and parental antagonism are commonly considered two major processes in the evolution of family life, their co-occurrence and the evolutionary consequences of their joint action are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate the simultaneous and entangled effects of these two processes on outcomes of family interactions, using a series of breeding experiments in the European earwig, Forficula auricularia, an insect species with uniparental female care. As predicted from parental antagonism, we show that paternally inherited effects expressed in offspring influence both maternal care and maternal investment in future reproduction. However, and as expected from the entangled effects of parental antagonism and co-adaptation, these effects critically depended on postnatal interactions with caring females and maternally inherited effects expressed in offspring.

Here, we experimentally explore the impacts of inorganic nutrients and organic matter on a range of food web properties. We find that these two stressors combine additively to produce significant increases in connectance and mean food chain length. Such increases are typically associated with enhanced robustness to secondary extinctions and productivity, respectively. Despite these apparent beneficial effects, we find a simplification of web structure in terms of taxon richness and diversity, and altered proportions of basal and top species. These effects are driven by a reduction in community assembly and lower consistency in a range of system properties as a result of the multiple stressors.

Using the LPJmL Dynamic Global Vegetation Model, we modelled spatio-temporal changes in net biome production (NBP); the difference between carbon fluxes from fire, deforestation, soil respiration and net primary production. By 2050, deforestation and fire (with no CO(2) increase or climate change) resulted in carbon losses of 7.4-20.3 Pg C with the range of uncertainty depending on socio-economic storyline. During the same time period, interactions between climate and land use either compensated for carbon losses due to wetter climate and CO(2) fertilization or exacerbated carbon losses from drought-induced forest mortality (-20.1 to +4.3 Pg C). By the end of the 21st century, depending on climate projection and the rate of deforestation (including its interaction with fire), carbon stocks either increased (+12.6 Pg C) or decreased (-40.6 Pg C). The synergistic effect of deforestation and fire with climate change contributed up to 26-36 Pg C of the overall decrease in carbon stocks.

Our goals were to determine: (1) the relative importance of different environmental variables, (2) whether accurate predictions can be developed from these models, and (3) how a comparison of the models against known species ecology can be used to assess model relevance and to provide further insights that could drive future studies of these species. Location The Recherche Archipelago, southern Western Australia. Methods Fish distribution data were collected using baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVS): environmental characteristics (substrate type, macroalgal type and presence of sessile biota) were derived from the video footage; and water depth was measured with a depth sounder. Two species distribution modelling techniques were used to explore and quantify the contribution of environmental characteristics to distribution models of 10 temperate marine fish species. Results Substrate type (reef, sand, cobble) was the most influential variable, and water depth and macroalgal type influenced the probable occurrence of species even over the same substrate type. The probable occurrences of all but one fish species were predicted very successfully, with observed presences being predicted correctly with accuracies > 76%. These predictions were possible due to strong associations between these species and benthic features recorded in this study (substrate type, depth and macroalgal type). Main conclusions The results demonstrate that the combined influence of multiple environmental gradients must be considered to further develop our understanding of how the environment structures demersal fish distributions. The species distribution models not only agreed with the known ecology of the species examined in detail, but also provided more information on the strength of each environmental attribute and interactions between attributes.

Reducing the bias and variance of estimates of population parameters reduces uncertainty in population status and projections, thereby reducing the overall uncertainty under which a population manager must make a decision. In capture recapture studies, imperfect detection of individuals, unobservable life-history states, local movement outside study areas, and tag loss can cause bias or precision problems with estimates of population parameters. Furthermore, excessive disturbance to individuals during capture-recapture sampling may be of concern because disturbance may have demographic consequences. We address these problems using as an example a monitoring program for Black-footed Albatross (Phoebastria nigripes) and Laysan Albatross (Phoebastria immutabilis) nesting populations in the northwestern Hawaiian Islands. To mitigate these estimation problems, we describe a synergistic combination of sampling design and modeling approaches. Solutions include multiple capture periods per season and multistate, robust design statistical models, dead recoveries and incidental observations, telemetry and data loggers, buffer areas around study plots to neutralize the effect of local movements outside study plots, and double banding and statistical models that account for band loss. We also present a variation on the robust capture-recapture design and a corresponding statistical model that minimizes disturbance to individuals. For the albatross case study, this less invasive robust design was more time efficient and, when used in combination with a traditional robust design, reduced the standard error of detection probability by 14% with only two hours of additional effort in the field.

Nearly half of the American white pelican population breeds at four colonies in the northern plains: Chase Lake National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in North Dakota, Bitter Lake (Waubay NWR) in South Dakota, Medicine Lake NWR in Montana, and Marsh Lake in Minnesota. Thus, sustained productivity at these colonies is crucial to the health of the entire species. During the latter half of the 2002 and 2003 breeding seasons, unusually high mortality of pelican chicks was observed at these colonies. West Nile virus (WNv) was identified as one source of these losses. In 2004-2007 we monitored three major colonies in the northern plains to assess mortality of chicks during the late breeding season. We documented severe weather events, disturbance, and WNv as factors contributing to chick mortality. Before WNv arrived in the region in 2002, chick mortality after mid-July was <= 4%, and then jumped to as high as 44% in the years since WNv arrived. WNv kills older chicks that are no longer vulnerable to other common mortality factors (e.g., severe weather, gull predation) and typically would have survived to fledge; thus WNv appears to be an additive mortality factor. Persistence of lower productivity at American white pelican colonies in the northern plains might reduce the adult breeding population of this species in the region.

Colonial species have been proposed to be more vulnerable than dispersed, solitary species to disturbance and perceived risk from hunting. However, empirical comparisons of density dependence vs. risk disturbance in hunted species are few. To compare density dependence with risk-disturbance effects of hunting on individuals and populations of a colonial species, we tested the response of black-tailed prairie dogs Cynomys ludovicianus to shooting in a before-after, treatment-control experiment. We subjected five colonies to a pulse of shooting, and compared individual and colony attributes to those of five control colonies, protected from shooting. Surviving prairie dogs increased alert behaviours eightfold and reduced both above-ground activity and time spent foraging by 66%. Changes in behaviour lowered the body condition of surviving adults by 35%. Survivors of shooting, especially juveniles, exhibited elevated stress levels; faecal corticosterone concentrations increased by 80% among juveniles. Unexpectedly, overwinter survival rates did not increase in response to reduced prairie dog density. Colonies subjected to shooting experienced reproductive near-collapse the summer after shooting; pregnancy rates declined by 50% and reproductive output fell by 82%. Risk-disturbance overwhelmed any possible density-dependent effects of shooting in prairie dogs, which exhibited additive mortality in response to hunting, and reproductive failure 1 year after shooting. Risk-disturbance was the predominant mechanism whereby individuals and colonies were affected by hunting. Synthesis and applications. Because of their coloniality, prairie dogs possess certain life-history traits that predisposed them to be particularly susceptible to hunting-associated disturbances, which had cascading effects on population-level processes. Our findings contradict the general belief that small-bodied mammals quickly rebound from hunting exploitation via compensatory mortality and reproduction. Managers should consider measures to reduce recreational shooting intensity and duration in regions where black-tailed prairie dog colony growth and persistence is desired, yet allow shooting in areas where colonies conflict with landowner interests.",18,2007,44,6,1219,1230"Aiba, S; Hanya, G; Tsujino, R; Takyu, M; Seino, T; Kimura, K; Kitayama, K",Comparative study of additive basal area of conifers in forest ecosystems along elevational gradients,ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH,Article; Proceedings Paper,"We examined the basal area of two life forms (conifers vs. broadleaf trees) along elevational gradients on Yakushima Island, Japan and on two series of geological substrate on Mount Kinabalu, Borneo. On Yakushima, total stand basal area abruptly increased from 700 to 1,050 m in accordance with the high dominance of conifers, indicating the presence of additive basal area of conifers in conifer-broadleaf mixed forests at higher elevations (1,050-1,300 m). Along two substrate series on Kinabalu, some forests at higher elevations (1,860-3,080 m) showed relatively high dominance of conifers, but conifer basal area did not appear to be additive. Conifers were emergents above the canopy of broadleaf trees in mixed forests on Yakushima, but two life forms usually coexisted in the single-story canopy in mixed forests on Kinabalu. Litterfall rate as a surrogate of productivity decreased with decreasing temperature along elevation on both the sites, but the rate of decrease was slower on Yakushima, where mixed forests at higher elevations showed relatively high rates. Thus, we suggest that additive basal area of conifers was linked to their emergent status, and that it enhanced productivity by complementary use of light by two life forms that occupy different stories. On Yakushima, typhoons are a major disturbance, but do not severely limit the height growth of conifers, allowing the development of two-story mixed forests. On Kinabalu, a major disturbance is El Nino-driven drought, and hydraulic limitation to tree height may explain the non-additive and non-emergent nature of conifers.",18,2007,22,3,439,450"Roy, PS; Padalia, H; Chauhan, N; Porwal, MC; Gupta, S; Biswas, S; Jagdale, R","Validation of geospatial model for biodiversity characterization at landscape level - a study in Andaman & Nicobar Islands, India",ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,Article,"The present paper deals with Biodiversity Characterization at Landscape Level, preparing thematic maps for spatial representation of landscape parameters and then validation of the geospatial model using a three-tier approach, viz., landscape analysis, field data extrapolation and geospatial analysis, for two groups of islands in Indian subcontinent. On-screen visual interpretation approach based on IRS LISS-III and Landsat TM data sets was used to delineate the vegetation communities. Field survey attributes on species diversity, economical/medicinal uses and endemism were suitably linked with satellite image-derived landscape attributes in a geospatial domain. The landscape parameters, viz., fragmentation and disturbance index, clearly indicate that Nicobar Islands are less disturbed compared to Andaman. The phytosociological data of different vegetation types collected from 544 stratified sample points was recorded with ground coordinates. The plant communities of Andaman show high plant diversity in terms of number of species (523 species) and more heterogeneity compared to those of Nicobar (347 species). Biological richness was estimated as a function of six biodiversity attributes (i.e., spatial, phytosociological, social, physical, economical and ecological) to stratify forest vegetation in two phytogeographically distinct groups of tropical islands, viz., Andaman and Nicobar, using a customized software, SPLAM. Validation of ecological indices had always been a major challenge for ecologist. Here, we discuss a validation technique using field-driven species regression equations for fragmentation (FR), disturbance (DI) and biological richness (BR) indices and propose improvements in the biological richness methodology. The research question of establishment of linkages between expressions of diversity at different scales is sought and thereby validating the existing model outputs has been proposed. The sensitivity of in-field measurements with landscape parameters has been explicitly analyzed. During validation, the species richness, diversity and mean basal area have shown slow decrease with sudden rise in intermediate levels followed by a steep decline at increasing levels of fragmentation and disturbance. The empirically derived regression coefficient has significant correspondence (p < 0.05) in terms of community response in both island's groups. The vegetation communities in the forested landscape possess significant linkages with landscape scale processes, viz., FR and DI, as evident by the degree of correlation. The heterogeneity measured as diversity in habit group shows community dimensions in different spatial zones. The generation of baseline data on community ecology allows prioritization of planning process and evolves specific management practices. It may be concluded that the improved biodiversity assessment model and the designed validation techniques have enhanced the reliability of model thus widened the scope for its application in the rapid biodiversity assessment.

In the beginning of the experiment, all experimental trees were 7 years old and during the experiment the trees were growing in sandy field soil and fertilized regularly. In general, elevated O-3 caused soil CO2 efflux stimulation during most measurement days and this stimulation enhanced towards the end of the experiment. The overall soil respiration response to CO2 was dependent on the genotype, as the soil CO2 efflux below clone 80 trees was enhanced and below clone 4 trees was decreased under elevated CO2 treatments. Like the O-3 impact, this clonal difference in soil respiration response to CO2 increased as the experiment progressed. Although the O-3 impact did not differ significantly between clones, a significant time x clone x CO(2)x O-3 interaction revealed that the O-3-induced stimulation of soil respiration was counteracted by elevated CO2 in clone 4 on most measurement days, whereas in clone 80, the effect of elevated CO2 and O-3 in combination was almost constantly additive during the 3-year experiment. Altogether, the root or above-ground biomass results were only partly parallel with the observed soil CO2 efflux responses. In conclusion, our data show that O-3 impacts may appear first in the below-ground processes and that relatively long-term O-3 exposure had a cumulative effect on soil CO2 efflux. Although the soil respiration response to elevated CO2 depended on the tree genotype as a result of which the O-3 stress response might vary considerably within a single tree species under elevated CO2, the present experiment nonetheless indicates that O-3 stress is a significant factor affecting the carbon cycling in northern forest ecosystems.",18,2004,10,10,1654,1665"Kennington, WJ; Gilchrist, AS; Goldstein, DB; Partridge, L",The genetic bases of divergence in desiccation and starvation resistance among tropical and temperate populations of Drosophila melanogaster,HEREDITY,Article,"Desiccation and starvation resistance are two stress-related traits which vary geographically with climate in Drosophila melanogaster. To investigate the contribution of epistasis to population divergence for these traits, we crossed tropical and temperate populations from two different geographical regions to produce F(1), F(2) and first backcross generations. Line-cross analysis of generation means revealed that genetic bases of divergence for both traits were complex and remarkably similar in a number of respects. Strong additive and dominance effects were present in most of the models, whereas epistatic and maternal effects were less common. The presence of epistatic effects in approximately half of the models presented in this study is consistent with line-cross studies of diverged traits in other animals, and does not support the view that epistasis is the predominant means by which populations diverge. In addition, evidence of maternal effects in both traits adds to a growing body of recent evidence that suggests maternal contributions to population differentiation are more widespread than previously thought. This finding undermines the accuracy of studies inferring epistasis directly from the magnitude of F(2) breakdown. More line-cross analysis studies of naturally diverged populations that take into account maternal effects will shed further light on the true incidence of epistasis and its importance in the evolutionary process.",18,2001,87,,363,372"Pahkala, M; Laurila, A; Bjorn, LO; Merila, J",Effects of ultraviolet-B radiation and pH on early development of the moor frog Rana arvalis,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,Article,"1. Although the potential negative effects of increased ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation on early life stages of aquatic organisms are widely recognized, possible synergistic effects with other stressors have seldom been studied outside the laboratory. We investigated the effects of UV-B radiation and pH on hatchability and early development of moor frog Rana arvalis eggs in the field and in laboratory experiments conducted during April 1998 and April 2000 in central Sweden. 2. In the field experiments, no evidence was found for reduced hatchability or increased frequency of developmental anomalies of embryos exposed to ambient levels of UV-B compared with embryos shielded from UV-B radiation. 3. Hatchlings shielded from ambient UV-B radiation did not grow larger than their exposed full-sibs, giving no support to the hypotheses that (i) the repair of cellular UV-B damage might be energetically costly nor (ii) that UV-B-induced photoproducts directly reduce growth. 4. Although low pH (5.0) reduced hatchability, increased frequency of developmental anomalies and reduced early embryonic growth in R. arvalis, there was no evidence for synergistic effects of pH and UV-B on any of these traits. 5. The lack of UV-B radiation effects on the development of R. arvalis embryos cannot be ascribed to relatively low effective daily doses of radiation (c. 0.43 kJ m(-2)) during the field experiments, as in the laboratory even higher doses at UV-B 1.25 kJ m(-2) and 1.58 kJ m(-2) (all DNA weighed) had no negative effects. 6.

For Beringia, patterns of benthic diversity are best understood in a manner that matches the multiscale, integrated dynamics of weather, ice, marine mammal feeding, and community structure. In the case of US East Coast estuaries, oyster reefs may be keystone elements, with important effects on functional diversity. Large-scale coastal systems depend upon the connectivity of fresh and marine waters in the coastal zone, having implications for the apparent stochasticity of coastal fisheries. And, for a coastal barrier-lagoon site, a state change may be described in terms of a combination of succession, the attainment of a quasi-equilibrium state, and disturbance.

One of the mechanisms of sex chromosome turnover involves fusions between sex chromosomes and autosomes. Sexual antagonism, heterozygote advantage, and genetic drift have been proposed as the drivers for the fixation of this evolutionary event. However, all empirical patterns of the prevalence of multiple sex chromosome systems across different taxa cannot be simply explained by these three mechanisms. In this study, we propose that female meiotic drive may contribute to the evolution of neo-sex chromosomes. The results of this study showed that in mammals, the XY1Y2 sex chromosome system is more prevalent in species with karyotypes of more biarmed chromosomes, whereas the X1X2Y sex chromosome system is more prevalent in species with predominantly acrocentric chromosomes. In species where biarmed chromosomes are favored by female meiotic drive, X-autosome fusions (XY1Y2 sex chromosome system) will be also favored by female meiotic drive. In contrast, in species with more acrocentric chromosomes, Y-autosome fusions (X1X2Y sex chromosome system) will be favored just because of the biased mutation rate toward chromosomal fusions. Further consideration should be given to female meiotic drive as a mechanism in the fixation of neo-sex chromosomes.",17,2012,66,10,3198,3208"Runcie, DE; Garfield, DA; Babbitt, CC; Wygoda, JA; Mukherjee, S; Wray, GA",Genetics of gene expression responses to temperature stress in a sea urchin gene network,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,Article,"Stress responses play an important role in shaping species distributions and robustness to climate change. We investigated how stress responses alter the contribution of additive genetic variation to gene expression during development of the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, under increased temperatures that model realistic climate change scenarios. We first measured gene expression responses in the embryos by RNA-seq to characterize molecular signatures of mild, chronic temperature stress in an unbiased manner. We found that an increase from 12 to 18 degrees C caused widespread alterations in gene expression including in genes involved in protein folding, RNA processing and development. To understand the quantitative genetic architecture of this response, we then focused on a well-characterized gene network involved in endomesoderm and ectoderm specification. Using a breeding design with wild-caught individuals, we measured genetic and geneenvironment interaction effects on 72 genes within this network. We found genetic or maternal effects in 33 of these genes and that the genetic effects were correlated in the network. Fourteen network genes also responded to higher temperatures, but we found no significant genotypeenvironment interactions in any of the genes. This absence may be owing to an effective buffering of the temperature perturbations within the network. In support of this hypothesis, perturbations to regulatory genes did not affect the expression of the genes that they regulate.

In this study, we set up a manipulation experiment including three levels of genotypic diversity to test whether genotypic diversity can enhance the invasive ability of alien species, in our case the invasive Spartina alterniflora in China, and to infer the underlying mechanisms. There was no significant relationship between genotypic diversity and parameters of performance in the first year; however, from the summer of the second year onwards, genotypic diversity enhanced four of the six parameters of performance.

Moreover, abundance of the native dominant species Scirpus mariqueter was marginally significantly decreased with genotypic diversity of S. alterniflora, suggesting that enhanced invasive ability of S. alterniflora may have depressed the growth of the native species. There was no significant difference in most measures of performance among six genotypes, but we observed a transgressive over performance in four measures in multiple-genotype patches.

It is important to understand how such variations affect epidemiological dynamics in host-parasite systems. We explored effects of temporal variation in temperature on experimental microcosm populations of the ciliate Paramecium caudatum and its bacterial parasite Holospora undulata. Infected and uninfected populations of two P. caudatum genotypes were created and four constant temperature treatments (26 degrees C, 28 degrees C, 30 degrees C and 32 degrees C) compared with four variable treatments with the same mean temperatures. Variable temperature treatments were achieved by alternating populations between permissive (23 degrees C) and restrictive (35 degrees C) conditions daily over 30 days. Variable conditions and high temperatures caused greater declines in Paramecium populations, greater fluctuations in population size and higher incidence of extinction. The additional effect of parasite infection was additive and enhanced the negative effects of the variable environment and higher temperatures by up to 50 per cent. The variable environment and high temperatures also caused a decrease in parasite prevalence (up to 40%) and an increase in extinction (absence of detection) (up to 30%). The host genotypes responded similarly to the different environmental stresses and their effect on parasite traits were generally in the same direction.

What are the species-specific habitat requirements? Are predictions in accordance with expert knowledge? Location: Bavarian Alps (Southern Germany). Methods: To describe tree species-environment relationships, we established species distribution models for the 14 most common tree species of the region. We combined tree species occurrence data from forest inventories and a vegetation database with environmental data from a digital elevation model, climate maps and soil maps. For modelling, we used generalized additive models (GAM) combined with techniques to account for spatial autocorrelation and uneven coverage of environmental gradients. We developed parsimonious models to judge whether statistical models correspond to models based on expert knowledge. Results: Conceptual models were generally in accordance with expectations. Variables based on average temperatures were the most important predictors in most models. Proxies for soil properties such as water and nutrient availability were statistically significant and generally plausible, but appeared largely redundant for model performance. Altitudinal limits of tree species were generally well represented by models. Most species responded differently to summer and January temperatures, indicating that temperature variables are proxies not only for energy balance, but also for frost damage and drought. Although model building benefits considerably from collation with expert knowledge, there are limitations. Conclusions: Meaningful species distribution models can be obtained from noisy data sets covering only a small fraction of species ranges. Models calibrated with such data sets benefit from hypothesis-driven model building rather than strict data-driven model building. Hence, misleading explanations and predictions can be avoided and uncertainties identified. Nevertheless, projections based on climate scenarios can be substantially improved only with models calibrated on a wider data set.

Population dynamics of small pelagic fish may therefore be regulated neither strictly bottom-up nor top-down, but rather through multiple external and internal drivers. While in many studies single drivers have been identified, potential synergies of multiple factors, as well as their relative importance in regulating population dynamics of small pelagic fish, is a largely unresolved issue. Using a statistical, age-structured modeling approach, we demonstrate the relative importance and influence of bottom-up (e.g., climate, zooplankton availability) and top-down (i.e., fishing and predation) factors on the population dynamics of Bothnian Sea herring (Clupea harengus) throughout its life cycle. Our results indicate significant bottom-up effects of zooplankton and interspecific competition from sprat (Sprattus sprattus), particularly on younger age classes of herring. Although top-down forcing through fishing and predation by grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) also was evident, these factors were less important than resource availability and interspecific competition.

Given their demonstrated resistance to environmental stress, it might be expected that the role of sponges in reef systems under modern regimes of frequent and severe disturbance may become even more substantial. Disturbances have recently reshaped the community structure of many Caribbean coral reefs shifting them towards a state of persistent low coral cover and often a dominance of macroalgae. Using competition and growth rates recorded from Glover's Atoll in Belize, we parameterise a mathematical model used to simulate the three-way competition between sponges, macroalgae and coral. We use the model to determine the range of parameters in which each of the three species might be expected to dominate. Emergent properties arise from our simple model of this complex system, and these include a special case in which heightened competitive ability of macroalgae versus coral may counter-intuitively prove to be advantageous to the persistence of corals. Importantly, we show that even under scenarios whereby sponges fail to invade the system, inclusion of this third antagonist can qualitatively affect the likelihood of alternative stable states - generally in favour of macroalgal dominance. The interplay between multi-species competition and predation is complex, but our efforts highlight a key process that has, until now, remained unexplored: the extent to which sponges dissipate algal grazing pressure by providing generalist fish with an alternative food source. We highlight the necessity of identifying the extent by which this process takes place in tropical systems in order to improve projections of alternative stable states for Caribbean coral reefs.

It has been recently proposed that fast growth leads to the accumulation of cellular damages due to oxidative stress, influencing subsequent performances and life span. Therefore, the trade-off between fast growth and oxidative stress may potentially function as an important constraint in the evolution of growth trajectories. We test this by examining a potential antagonistic pleiotropy between growth and blood resistance to controlled free radical attack in a wild bird using a cross-fostering design and robust quantitative genetic analyses. In the yellow-legged gull Larus michahellis, decreased resistance to oxidative stress at age 8 days was associated with faster growth in mass, across the first 8 days of life, suggesting a trade-off between mass growth and oxidative-stress-related somatic maintenance. We found a negative genetic correlation between chick growth and resistance to oxidative stress, supporting the presence of the genetic trade-off between the two traits. Therefore, investment of somatic resources in growth could be constrained by resistance to oxidative stress in phenotypic and genetic levels. Our results provide first evidence for a potential genetic trade-off between life-history and underlying physiological traits in a wild vertebrate.

Here, we focus on forest commons in human-dominated landscapes and their role in biodiversity conservation at the same time as they provide livelihood benefits to users. Using a dataset of 59 forest commons located in Bhutan, India, and Nepal, we estimated tree species richness from plot vegetation data collected in each forest, and drew on interview data to calculate a livelihoods index indicating the overall contribution of each forest to villager livelihoods for firewood, fodder, and timber. We found that tree species richness and livelihoods were positively and significantly correlated (rho = .41, p < 0.001, N = 59). This relationship held regardless of forest type or country, though significance varied somewhat across these two factors. Further, both benefits were similarly associated with several drivers of social-ecological change (e.g., occupational diversity of forest users, total number of users, and forest size), suggesting identification of potential synergies and complexes of causal mechanisms for future attention. Our analysis shows that forest commons in South Asia, explicitly managed to provide livelihoods for local populations, also provide biodiversity benefits.

Nutrients (inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus) and the polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) pyrene were added singly and in combination, to study the combined effects of nutrients and toxicants on the base of the food web of a shallow-water illuminated sediment. The microbenthic community of natural sieved, sediment was used in a in a flow-through laboratory experiment lasting 28 days. Variables measured included benthic microalgal and meiofaunal biomass and composition, and meiofaunal grazing rates. The hypotheses were that (i) pyrene exposure affects meiofauna and their grazing rate, resulting in increased benthic microalgal biomass, and that (ii) pyrene effects depend on nutrient status, as found in previous mesocosm experiments. Our results showed that exposure to a low, environmentally realistic concentration of pyrene had a general negative effect on meiofauna and their grazing rates, although major taxonomical groups differed in response. A concomitant increase in benthic microalgal biomass suggested a cascading effect on the primary producers. Whether there was a significant interaction between pyrene and nutrient status depended on the variable measured. While toxicant effects on total meiofaunal grazing rate, chlorophyll a content of the sediment and microalgal composition depended on nutrient status, the effects on meiofaunal and algal biomass (based on cell counts) did not. We found only partial support for our specific hypothesis that pyrene effects were greater when nutrient concentrations were high. The mode of nutrient-toxicant interaction appeared to vary with variable: non-additive effects (antagonistic or synergistic) were more common than additive effects, but some effects could also be interpreted according to a comparative model. This apparent variation in interaction mode highlights the complexity of nutrient-toxicant interactions - and of multiple stressors in general - in the marine benthic environment, emphasizing the need to consider both structural and functional variables when assessing effects of stressor interactions. Moreover, the presence of potential indirect, food web-mediated effects underlines the need to test multiple-stressor effects using multitrophic communities. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Juvenile fish developed spinal malformations when exposed either to infections alone or to infections and glyphosate, with a trend towards greater severity of spinal malformation after exposure to both stressors. 5. All snails exposed to the highest glyphosate concentration (36 mg a.i. L-1) died within 24 h. Snails exposed to a moderate concentration (3 center dot 6 mg a.i. L-1) produced significantly more T. opisthorchis cercariae than snails in the control group or the low concentration group (0 center dot 36 mg a.i. L-1; the same concentration as in the fish experiment). 6. Synthesis and applications. This is the first study to show that parasites and glyphosate can act synergistically on aquatic vertebrates at environmentally relevant concentrations, and that glyphosate might increase the risk of disease in fish. Our results have important implications when identifying risks to aquatic communities and suggest that threshold levels of glyphosate currently set by regulatory authorities do not adequately protect freshwater systems.",17,2010,47,2,498,504"Alton, LA; Wilson, RS; Franklin, CE",Risk of predation enhances the lethal effects of UV-B in amphibians,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Article,"Amphibian declines are a prominent part of the global biodiversity crisis and have received special consideration because they have occurred relatively recently, on a global scale, and in seemingly pristine habitats where no obvious anthropogenic cause is apparent. Although several causes for declines have been implicated, the isolation of a singular cause has proven elusive. Consequently, it has been hypothesized that complex interactions between multiple environmental stressors, particularly those associated with global change, may be responsible. Increasing ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B) associated with stratospheric ozone depletion is one such stressor that has received considerable attention. UV-B causes enhanced lethal effects when combined with other factors such as aquatic pH, contaminants, temperature and pathogens, but little is known of how UV-B interacts with pervasive biological stressors, such as risk of predation. We exposed Limnodynastes peronii tadpoles to UV-B and predatory chemical cues in a controlled laboratory experiment to determine their independent and interactive effects on survival and morphology. We show that UV-B and risk of predation interact synergistically to enhance mortality above the additive effects of the independent stressors, and that exposure to UV-B affects the ability of tadpoles to morphologically respond to predatory chemical cues (i.e. predator-induced phenotypic plasticity), which has implications for their survival in an environment with predators.

This requires understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of human pressures and their impacts. Quantifying seabed recovery rates from 2 significant pressures in European waters, benthic fishing and aggregate extraction, is a significant step towards assessing sensitivity and cumulative impacts. Vessel monitoring system data were used to estimate the distribution and intensity of benthic fishing in UK (England and Wales) marine waters (2006 to 2007). Data were separated by towed bottom-fishing gears (scallop dredges, beam and otter trawls) and linked to habitat in a geographic information system. Recovery periods of seabed habitats were estimated by literature review, for gear types and fishing intensity. Recovery rates generally increased with sediment hardness, and habitats required longer periods of recovery from scallop dredging than from otter or beam trawling. Fishing pressure across the habitat-gear combinations was such that 80% of the bottom-fished area was estimated to be able to recover completely before repeat trawling, based on mean annual trawl frequencies. However, in 19% of the UK's bottom-fished seabed, scallop dredging in sand and gravel and otter trawling in muddy sand and reef habitats occurred at frequencies that prevented full habitat recovery. In 2007, benthic fishing and aggregate extraction occurred together in an estimated 40 km(2) (<0.02%) of the UK seabed. Cumulative impacts were estimated as total recovery time under 4 scenarios: greatest, additive, antagonistic and synergistic impacts. Recovery from aggregate extraction required much greater periods than from benthic fishing, and gravel was identified as a more sensitive habitat than sand.",17,2010,411,,259,270"Hendrickx, F; Maelfait, JP; Lens, L",Effect of metal stress on life history divergence and quantitative genetic architecture in a wolf spider,JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,Article,"Effects and consequences of stress exposure on life history strategies and quantitative genetic variation in wild populations remain poorly understood. We here study whether long-term exposure to heavy metal pollution may result in alternative life history strategies and alter quantitative genetic properties in natural populations of the wolf spider Pirata piraticus. Offspring originating from a reference and a metal contaminated population and their reciprocal hybrid cross were bred in a half-sib mating scheme and subsequently reared in cadmium contaminated vs. clean environment. Results from this experiment provided evidence for a genetically based reduced growth rate and increased egg size in the contaminated population. Growth rate reduction in response to cadmium contamination was only observed for the reference population. Animal model analysis revealed that heritability for growth rate was large for the reference population under reference conditions, but much lower under metal stressed conditions, caused by a strong decrease in additive genetic variance. Heritability for growth of the metal contaminated population was very low, even under reference conditions. Initial size of the offspring was primarily determined by maternal effects, whereas egg size produced by the offspring was determined by both sire and dam effects, indicating that egg size determination is under control of the female genotype.

Wildfires are predicted to increase in many ecosystems in relation to globally increasing temperatures but future patterns of post-fire vegetation change are largely unknown, particularly when there are synergistic effects from introduced biota. In the late 1990s northern Patagonia, Argentina, experienced extreme droughts which led to severe wildfires affecting a range of Andean ecosystems. 2. We experimentally examined how variations in moisture, temperature and herbivory by livestock affect post-1999 fire patterns of the three main tree species. Over two years we monitored, in three forest types, the survival and growth of tree seedlings in a factorial warming (+2 degrees C)/livestock exclosure/watering experiment. 3. Seedling survival in the warmed treatments and in the controls was nil for the evergreen Nothofagus dombeyi and the conifer Austrocedrus chilensis at the two low-elevation experimental sites. Survival of the subalpine Nothofagus pumilio in the warmed treatments at high elevation tended to be lower than in the control; for all treatments of warming alone there were no significant differences compared with the controls. 4. In all three forest types, increased water availability was essential for higher rates of tree seedling survival. Doubling water availability during the growing season resulted in up to fourfold increases in seedling survival and up to threefold increases in seedling biomass. 5. In the subalpine forest, livestock reduced seedling survival by c. 30% in non-watered treatments compared with watered treatments, probably due mainly to soil desiccation and to consumption of or damage to facilitating plants. In contrast, at lower elevation, where livestock pressure was lower, seedling survival of N. dombeyi and A. chilensis tended to be higher in unfenced sites, possibly due to reduced competition from highly palatable shrub species. 6. General circulation models predict a warming-drying trend in northern Patagonia during the twenty-first century. The resulting increase in wildfire is likely to be followed by inadequate tree regeneration and conversion from forest to shrubland cover types. This and similar studies suggest that under relatively slight changes in regional climate, increased fire occurrence interacting synergistically with moisture limitations will result in long-lasting displacements of forest by more xeric vegetation shrublands.",17,2007,95,4,771,779"Havens, KE; Gawlik, DE",Lake Okeechobee conceptual ecological model,WETLANDS,Review,"With a surface area of nearly 1,800 square kilometers, Lake Okeechobee is a prominent central feature of the South Florida aquatic ecosystem. The lake provides regional flood protection, supports a prized recreational fishery, provides habitat for migratory waterfowl and regional wading bird populations, and is a source of fresh water for irrigation, drinking, and restoration of downstream ecosystems. The main stressors on Lake Okeechobee are (1) large inputs of phosphorus from agricultural and other anthropogenic land uses in the watershed, (2) unnatural variation in water levels due to channelization of inflows and dike containment, and (3) rapid expansion of non-native plants. Ecological effects are complicated due to three distinct in-lake zones with different water chemistry, physical properties, and biota. A central pelagic zone has turbid, nutrient-rich water and phytoplankton dominance; a shallow south and western near-shore zone has submerged plant or phytoplankton dominance (at low vs. high water levels, respectively); and a western littoral zone is dominated by emergent wetland plants. Changes in water level influence the flow of nutrients between zones, thereby creating a synergistic effect between stressors. Under high water conditions, there is considerable advective transport of nutrients from the pelagic zone into the littoral zone. Under low water conditions, the littoral zone is cut off hydrologically and is a rainfall-driven oligotrophic wetland. Low water also facilitates drying and wildfires in the littoral zone, which in turn has an influence on expansion of non-native plants and recovery of native plants from buried seed banks. All of these factors influence fish, wading birds, and other animals, which depend on littoral and near-shore plant communities for nesting and foraging habitat.

Sensory modalities that allow tadpoles to assess their environment, and subsequently mediate their development, are not well understood. 2. By putting clay model tadpoles into the tanks with live tadpoles we have enhanced tactile and visual stimuli for tadpoles of three species (Rana sylvatica, Bufo americanus and Xenopus laevis) in a controlled fashion. The goal was to determine whether visual and tactile cues in the absence of chemical signals influenced tadpole growth and development. 3. The response to enhanced visual and tactile stimuli was strong in Rana, intermediate in Xenopus, but absent in Bufo tadpoles. Rana tadpoles that experienced both stimuli enhanced developed the fastest and metamorphosed at the smallest body size. Development was slower in the treatments with only one stimulus enhanced, and slowest in the controls. 4. Our results suggest that tadpoles use both vision and mechanoreception for environment assessment, and that they are able to modify their growth and developmental rates in response to sensory enrichment. 5. Tadpoles exposed to the combination of visual and tactile stimulation showed the highest whole-body content of the stress hormone corticosterone, suggesting that the enhanced stimuli were experienced as stressful.

Edge environments are a dominant feature in these highly fragmented landscapes, and may directly influence the capacity of the vegetation to ameliorate microclimate conditions and support the successful regeneration of disturbed habitat. In this study, microclimate variables (surface soil moisture, photosynthetically active radiation and ground, surface and air temperatures) were assessed across edge gradients occurring between forest remnants and openings of different sizes (<0.1 and >1 ha) in both a highly fragmented landscape and a relatively undisturbed adjacent landscape over a 2-year period. Surface soil moistures increased progressively from the open areas (10.8-40.1 g m(-3)) into the forest understory (16.8-54.7 g m(-3)). The steepness of the edge gradient was less pronounced in the highly fragmented landscape (23.02 g m(-3)) compared to the reference landscape (29.34 g m(-3)). These results suggest that microsite variability across edges was reduced in this landscape in response to fragmentation. Further, the occurrence of an extreme drought event during the second year diminished differences between the fragmented and reference landscapes, thereby leading to greater homogeneity of the microclimate across the edge environments. Structural differences in forest patches within the fragmented landscape were also found to interact synergistically with habitat fragmentation to influence patterns in microclimate across edge environments. The capacity of oak forests to ameliorate the availability and flux of surface soil moisture in seasonally dry tropical ecosystems through their effect on evaporative moisture loss, and the reduction of this buffering capacity in response to habitat fragmentation documented in this study, suggests that fragmentation has significantly altered the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of microclimate conditions in these landscapes.

Insight into the capacity of natural enemies to control pests may lead to wiser pest management, including a reduction in the use of pesticides. The presence of polyphagous predators may contribute to the control of aphid populations and thereby prevent outbreaks. Many arthropod generalist predators have a limited tolerance to the consumption of aphids. However, differences exist between and within species in the ability to cope with an aphid diet; some within-species variation could be due to genetic differences between individuals. 2. In order to demonstrate additive genetic variation in aphid tolerance, a breeding programme was carried out where offspring of field-collected females of the linyphiid spider Lepthyphantes tenuis were selected for survival on a pure diet of the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi through the first juvenile instar. Aphid tolerance was estimated as the survival in proportion to survival of a control line, fed mixed collembola. Development and reproduction were recorded in order to detect possible selection effects. 3. After only one generation of selection, survival to the first moult on an aphid diet was significantly improved. The aphid tolerance of the first instar spiderlings increased by 63% and a high heritability for the trait was found. An F-2 control group derived from selected parents had significantly reduced survival compared with an F-2 control group derived from control parents. 4. Developmental rate and reproduction were lower in the selected group than in the control line, demonstrating a cost of tolerance to aphids. 5. The background of the genetic variation and its possible implications for the natural limitation of aphid populations in agricultural systems is discussed. Consideration of the control potential of polyphagous predators must include their genetic variation in aphid tolerance. Management practices aimed at augmenting specialist aphid predators, e.g. by erecting banks or cover crops containing non-pest aphids, may provide selection pressure for increased aphid tolerance in polyphagous predators.",17,2000,37,4,547,556"Brandt, AJ; de Kroon, H; Reynolds, HL; Burns, JH",Soil heterogeneity generated by plant-soil feedbacks has implications for species recruitment and coexistence,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Article,"1. Most studies of soil heterogeneity have focused on underlying abiotic factors such as soil nutrients. However, increasing recognition of plant-soil feedback (PSF) effects on plant growth, combined with the observation that PSFs operate at small spatial scales, suggests that heterogeneity due to PSF could affect plant population and community dynamics. The consequences of PSF-generated heterogeneity for coexistence depend on heterogeneity's effects on vital rates and how those vital rates influence population-level recruitment dynamics. 2. We measured vital rates and recruitment dynamics of three congeneric pairs of introduced perennial plants grown as monocultures in experimental PSF-generated soil environments. Field soils collected from conspecifics and congeners were alternated in patches or mixed together to produce heterogeneous and homogeneous soils, respectively. 3. We quantified the effects of PSF-generated heterogeneity on germination and establishment and determined how these vital rates affected recruitment. We calculated net pairwise interaction coefficients to predict whether PSFs could mediate coexistence between congeners. 4. Soil heterogeneity altered the relationship of vital rates to recruitment dynamics for some species. For example, Solanum dulcamara recruited later into heterogeneous than homogeneous soils, and germination was a stronger predictor of the timing of recruitment in heterogeneous soil, while mortality was a stronger predictor in homogeneous soil. Contrasts between soils of different origin suggest that mixing soils had non-additive effects on vital rates (e. g. Rumex crispus mortality was higher in homogeneous than in conspecific or congener soil). Interaction coefficients predicted that PSFs in heterogeneous soils might mediate stable coexistence only of Rumex congeners. 5. Synthesis. Heterogeneity generated by PSFs had species-specific effects on vital rates, with consequences for recruitment dynamics. Mixing soils of different origin often resulted in non-additive effects, which may indicate an interaction between soil abiotic and/or biotic properties and could predict non-additive responses to soil disturbance. Finally, quantifying the reciprocal effects of PSFs on congeners suggests that PSF-generated heterogeneity may promote coexistence of certain species, which was not evident from individual PSF responses. Future studies should determine whether such mechanisms might operate for more distantly related species.",16,2013,101,2,277,286"Luo, GJ; Kiese, R; Wolf, B; Butterbach-Bahl, K",Effects of soil temperature and moisture on methane uptake and nitrous oxide emissions across three different ecosystem types,BIOGEOSCIENCES,Article,"In this paper, we investigate similarities of effects of soil environmental drivers on year-round daily soil fluxes of nitrous oxide and methane for three distinct semi-natural or natural ecosystems: temperate spruce forest, Germany; tropical rain forest, Queensland, Australia; and ungrazed semi-arid steppe, Inner Mongolia, China. Annual cumulative fluxes of nitrous oxide and methane varied markedly among ecosystems, with nitrous oxide fluxes being highest for the tropical forest site (tropical forest: 0.96 kgN ha(-1) yr(-1); temperate forest: 0.67 kgN ha(-1) yr(-1); steppe: 0.22 kgN ha(-1) yr(-1)), while rates of soil methane uptake were approximately equal for the temperate forest (-3.45 kgC ha(-1) yr(-1)) and the steppe (-3.39 kgC ha(-1) yr(-1)), but lower for the tropical forest site (-2.38 kgC ha(-1) yr(-1)). In order to allow for cross-site comparison of effects of changes in soil moisture and soil temperature on fluxes of methane and nitrous oxide, we used a normalization approach. Data analysis with normalized data revealed that, across sites, optimum rates of methane uptake are found at environmental conditions representing approximately average site environmental conditions. This might have rather important implications for understanding effects of climate change on soil methane uptake potential, since any shift in environmental conditions is likely to result in a reduction of soil methane uptake ability. For nitrous oxide, our analysis revealed expected patterns: highest nitrous oxide emissions under moist and warm conditions and large nitrous oxide fluxes if soils are exposed to freeze-thawing effects at sufficiently high soil moisture contents. However, the explanatory power of relationships of soil moisture or soil temperature to nitrous oxide fluxes remained rather poor (R-2 <= 0.36). When combined effects of changes in soil moisture and soil temperature were considered, the explanatory power of our empirical relationships with regard to temporal variations in nitrous oxide fluxes were at maximum about 50 %. This indicates that other controlling factors such as N and C availability or microbial community dynamics might exert a significant control on the temporal dynamic of nitrous oxide fluxes. Though underlying microbial processes such as nitrification and denitrification are sensitive to changes in the environmental regulating factors, important regulating factors like moisture and temperature seem to have both synergistic and antagonistic effects on the status of other regulating factors. Thus we cannot expect a simple relationship between them and the pattern in the rate of emissions, associated with denitrification or nitrification in the soils. In conclusion, we hypothesize that our approach of data generalization may prove beneficial for the development of environmental response models, which can be used across sites, and which are needed to help achieve a better understanding of climate change feedbacks on biospheric sinks or sources of nitrous oxide and methane.",16,2013,10,5,3205,3219"Nimmo, DG; Kelly, LT; Spence-Bailey, LM; Watson, SJ; Haslem, A; White, JG; Clarke, MF; Bennett, AF",Predicting the century-long post-fire responses of reptiles,GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,Article,"Aim We examined the century-long post-fire responses of reptiles to (1) determine the time-scales over which fauna fire relationships occur, (2) assess the capacity of a conceptual model to predict faunal response to fire, and (3) investigate the degree to which models of fauna fire relationships can predict species occurrence and are transferable across space. Location A 104,000 km2 area in the semi-arid Murray Mallee region of south-eastern Australia. Methods We surveyed reptiles at 280 sites across a century-long post-fire chronosequence. We developed generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) of the relationship between time since fire and the occurrence of 17 species in two subregions, and compared modelled responses with predictions derived from the conceptual model. The predictive capacity of GAMMs was then assessed (1) within the subregion the model was developed and (2) when transferred into a novel subregion. Results Eleven species displayed a significant relationship with time-since-fire, with changes in species probability of occurrence continuing up to 100 years post-fire. Predictions of the timing of species post-fire peak in occurrence were accurate for 9 of 13 species models for which a significant fire response was detected, but little success was achieved in predicting the shape of a species' response. GAMMs predicted species occurrence more accurately when applied within the subregion in which they were developed than when transferred into a novel subregion, primarily due to some species responding to fire more strongly in one part of their geographic range. Main conclusions Fire influences the occurrence of reptiles in semi-arid ecosystems over century-long time frames. Habitat-use conceptual models have value in predicting the peak occurrence of species following fire, particularly for species with distributions strongly shaped by fire. Species relationships with fire can differ across their geographic range, probably associated with variation in climatic influences on post-fire succession and the consequent provision of habitat resources.",16,2012,21,11,1062,1073"Wikner, J; Andersson, A",Increased freshwater discharge shifts the trophic balance in the coastal zone of the northern Baltic Sea,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Article,"Increased precipitation is one projected outcome of climate change that may enhance the discharge of freshwater to the coastal zone. The resulting lower salinity, and associated discharge of both nutrients and dissolved organic carbon, may influence food web functioning. The scope of this study was to determine the net outcome of increased freshwater discharge on the balance between auto- and heterotrophic processes in the coastal zone. By using long-term ecological time series data covering 13 similar to years, we show that increased river discharge suppresses phytoplankton biomass production and shifts the carbon flow towards microbial heterotrophy. A 76% increase in freshwater discharge resulted in a 2.2 times higher ratio of bacterio- to phytoplankton production (Pb:Pp). The level of Pb:Pp is a function of riverine total organic carbon supply to the coastal zone. This is mainly due to the negative effect of freshwater and total organic carbon discharge on phytoplankton growth, despite a concomitant increase in discharge of nitrogen and phosphorus. With a time lag of 2 similar to years the bacterial production recovered after an initial decline, further synergistically elevating the microbial heterotrophy. Current climate change projections suggesting increased precipitation may therefore lead to increased microbial heterotrophy, thereby decreasing the transfer efficiency of biomass to higher trophic levels. This prognosis would suggest reduced fish production and lower sedimentation rates of phytoplankton, a factor of detriment to benthic fauna. Our findings show that discharge of freshwater and total organic carbon significantly contributes to the balance of coastal processes at large spatial and temporal scales, and that model's would be greatly augmented by the inclusion of these environmental drivers as regulators of coastal productivity.",16,2012,18,8,2509,2519"Egea-Serrano, A; Relyea, RA; Tejedo, M; Torralva, M",Understanding of the impact of chemicals on amphibians: a meta-analytic review,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Review,"Many studies have assessed the impact of different pollutants on amphibians across a variety of experimental venues (laboratory, mesocosm, and enclosure conditions). Past reviews, using vote-counting methods, have described pollution as one of the major threats faced by amphibians. However, vote-counting methods lack strong statistical power, do not permit one to determine the magnitudes of effects, and do not compare responses among predefined groups. To address these challenges, we conducted a meta-analysis of experimental studies that measured the effects of different chemical pollutants (nitrogenous and phosphorous compounds, pesticides, road deicers, heavy metals, and other wastewater contaminants) at environmentally relevant concentrations on amphibian survival, mass, time to hatching, time to metamorphosis, and frequency of abnormalities. The overall effect size of pollutant exposure was a medium decrease in amphibian survival and mass and a large increase in abnormality frequency. This translates to a 14.3% decrease in survival, a 7.5% decrease in mass, and a 535% increase in abnormality frequency across all studies. In contrast, we found no overall effect of pollutants on time to hatching and time to metamorphosis. We also found that effect sizes differed among experimental venues and among types of pollutants, but we only detected weak differences among amphibian families. These results suggest that variation in sensitivity to contaminants is generally independent of phylogeny. Some publication bias (i.e., selective reporting) was detected, but only for mass and the interaction effect size among stressors. We conclude that the overall impact of pollution on amphibians is moderately to largely negative.

We explore the relative importance of static and dynamic drivers in explaining the patterns of mortality of large trees in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Data on large trees were collected from 22 transects in April 2006, and these transects were re-sampled in November 2008. Of the 2546 individually-identified trees that were re-sampled, 290 (11.4%) died in the interim. We tested several competing hypotheses with varying levels of complexity, and found that mortality of large trees was affected mainly by both static (geophysical and landscape characteristics) and dynamic (elephant damage and fire) factors that were either additive or interactive in their effects. Elephant damage was the main predictor of tree mortality, but fire also played an important role depending on the landscape type. Other static variables such as position-on-slope, height below canopy, and altitude had weak effects in explaining tree mortality. These results indicate that keystone features such as large trees, show differential vulnerability to mortality that is landscape-specific. For conservation managers, this implies that the dynamic drivers (elephant and fire) of tree mortality have to be managed at the specific landscape-level. We suggest that this emergent biocomplexity in the spatial and temporal patterns of large tree mortality is not unique to the African savannas, but is likely widespread across heterogeneous landscapes.",16,2012,35,4,315,321"Li, ZH; Lu, GH; Yang, XF; Wang, C",Single and combined effects of selected pharmaceuticals at sublethal concentrations on multiple biomarkers in Carassius auratus,ECOTOXICOLOGY,Article,"In this study, the sublethal effects of caffeine, sulfamethoxazole and their mixture on goldfish (Carassius auratus) were investigated, the biomarkers including acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in brain, 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in liver and vitellogenin (VTG) in serum were determined after 1, 2, 4, and 7 days of exposure.

In agreement with expectations we found that rates of respiration and light saturated photosynthesis of summer acclimated plants peaked at higher temperatures (5 degrees C and 2 degrees C higher, respectively), and were lower than of winter acclimated plants, both at sub- and supra-optimal temperatures. Moreover respiration rates were generally more sensitive to increasing temperatures than photosynthetic rates, especially so for cold acclimated plants in February (36% higher Q(10)-values). These changes were accompanied by a reduction in chlorophyll a and nitrogen concentrations in leaves by 35% and 60% respectively from February to August. The critical light requirement (E(C)) of Z. marina to maintain a positive carbon balance increased exponentially with increasing temperature but less so for summer-acclimated than for winter-acclimated plants. However, combining E(C) vs temperature models for whole-plants with data on daily light availability showed that seasonal acclimation in metabolism increased the annual period, when light requirements were meet at the 2-5 m depth interval, by 32-66 days. Hence, acclimation is an important mechanism allowing eelgrass to grow faster and penetrate to deeper waters. Critical depth limits estimated for different combinations of summer temperatures and water clarity in a future climate scenario, suggested that expected increases in temperature and nutrient run-off have synergistic negative effects, especially in clear waters, stressing the importance of continued efforts to improve water clarity of coastal waters.

In the face of multiple stressors, diverse ecosystems may be more stable if species respond differently to stressors or if functionally similar species can compensate for stressor effects on focal species. Many habitats around the globe are threatened by multiple stressors, including highly productive seagrass habitats. For example, in Chesapeake Bay, USA, regional climate change predictions suggest that elevated temperature and freshwater inputs are likely to be increasingly important stressors. Using seagrass mesocosms as a model system, we tested whether species richness of crustacean grazers buffers ecosystem properties against the impacts of elevated temperature and freshwater pulse stressors in a fully factorial experiment. Grazer species responded to pulsed salinity changes differently; abundance of Elasmopus levis responded negatively to freshwater pulses, whereas abundance of Gammarus mucronatus and Erichsonella attenuata responded positively or neutrally. Consistent with the hypothesis that biodiversity provides resistance stability, biomass of epiphytic algae that form the base of the food web was less affected by stressors in species-rich grazer treatments than in single-species grazer treatments. Stochastic (among-replicate) variation of sessile invertebrate biomass within treatments was also reduced in more diverse grazer treatments. Therefore, grazer species richness tended to increase the resistance stability of both major components of the seagrass fouling community, algae and invertebrates, in the face of environmental stressors. Finally, in our model system, multi-stressor impacts suggested a pattern of antagonism contrary to previous assumptions of synergistic stressor effects. Overall, our results confirm that invertebrate grazer species are functionally diverse in their response to environmental stressors, but are largely functionally redundant in their grazing effects leading to greater resistance stability of certain ecosystem properties in diverse grazer assemblages even when influenced by multiple environmental stressors.",16,2010,119,10,1625,1635"Ochoa-Hueso, R; Manrique, E",Nitrogen fertilization and water supply affect germination and plant establishment of the soil seed bank present in a semi-arid Mediterranean scrubland,PLANT ECOLOGY,Article,"Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) inputs in terrestrial ecosystems are higher than those that occur naturally and have been related to global biodiversity loss and altered ecosystem functioning. However, its effects on Mediterranean-type ecosystems, where production is water-limited and N regulated, remain unclear. We conducted a green-house experiment where we evaluated the effects of four simulated scenarios of N pollution (0, 10, 20 and 50 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) and two differential water supply regimes on the germination (experiment 1) and early plant establishment (experiment 2) of a seed bank from a semi-arid Mediterranean ecosystem of central Spain. Seed bank density was estimated as 62,374 +/- A 3,279 seeds m(-2). Approximately 99.5% of emerged seeds corresponded to only 14 species of a total of 52, the majority of which were the annual forb Sagina apetala. The responses for N treatments were species-specific, mainly positive or unimodal, with watering treatments having some interactive effects. N and water supply also affected total and specific productivity; the responses found for N treatments were mainly humpback-shaped and an increased water supply had additive effects on community establishment in terms of total plant biomass. This response was linked to forb responsiveness. Contrary to predictions, grass biomass did not change with N supply; however, grass to forb ratio was affected because of changes in the latter. Overall, these experiments suggest a critical load for plant biomass production and conclude that N and water availability and supply can modify germination and plant establishment. This should be taken into account when analysing the effects of global change on the dynamics of plant communities where annuals are dominant or vegetation must establish from seed following a natural or anthropogenic disturbance regime.",16,2010,210,2,263,273"Saona, NM; Albrectsen, BR; Ericson, L; Bazely, DR",Environmental stresses mediate endophyte-grass interactions in a boreal archipelago,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Article,"1. Both evolutionary theory and empirical evidence from agricultural research support the view that asexual, vertically transmitted fungal endophytes are typically plant mutualists that develop high infection frequencies within host grass populations. In contrast, endophyte-grass interactions in natural ecosystems are more variable, spanning the range from mutualism to antagonism and comparatively little is known about their range of response to environmental stress. 2. We examined patterns in endophyte prevalence and endophyte-grass interactions across nutrient and grazing (from Greylag and Canada geese) gradients in 15 sites with different soil moisture levels in 13 island populations of the widespread grass Festuca rubra in a boreal archipelago in Sweden. 3. In the field, endophyte prevalence levels were generally low (range = 10-53%) compared with those reported from agricultural systems. Under mesic-moist conditions endophyte prevalence was constantly low (mean prevalence = 15%) and was not affected by grazing pressure or nutrient availability. In contrast, under conditions of drought, endophyte prevalence increased from 10% to 53% with increasing nutrient availability and increasing grazing pressure. 4. In the field, we measured the production of flowering culms, as a proxy for host fitness, to determine how endophyte-infected plants differed from uninfected plants. At dry sites, endophyte infection did not affect flowering culm production. In contrast, at mesic-moist sites production of flowering culms in endophyte-infected plants increased with the covarying effects of increasing nutrient availability and grazing pressure, indicating that the interaction switched from antagonistic to mutualistic. 5. A concurrent glasshouse experiment showed that in most situations, the host appears to incur some costs for harbouring endophytes. Uninfected grasses generally outperformed infected grasses (antagonistic interaction), while infected grasses outperformed uninfected grasses (mutualistic interaction) only in dry, nutrient-rich conditions. Nutrient and water addition affected tiller production, leaf number and leaf length differently, suggesting that tillers responded with different strategies. This emphasizes that several response variables are needed to evaluate the interaction. 6. Synthesis. This study found complex patterns in endophyte prevalence that were not always correlated with culm production. These contrasting patterns suggest that the direction and strength of selection on infected plants is highly variable and depends upon a suite of interacting environmental variables that may fluctuate in the intensity of their impact, during the course of the host life cycle.",16,2010,98,2,470,479"Meinke, CW; Knick, ST; Pyke, DA",A Spatial Model to Prioritize Sagebrush Landscapes in the Intermountain West (USA) for Restoration,RESTORATION ECOLOGY,Article,"The ecological integrity of Sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) ecosystems in the Intermountain West (U.S.A.) has been diminished by synergistic relationships among human activities, spread of invasive plants, and altered disturbance regimes. An aggressive effort to restore Sagebrush habitats is necessary if we are to stabilize or improve current habitat trajectories and reverse declining population trends of dependent wildlife. Existing economic resources, technical impediments, and logistic difficulties limit our efforts to a fraction of the extensive area undergoing fragmentation, degradation, and loss. We prioritized landscapes for restoring Sagebrush habitats within the intermountain western region of the United States using geographic information system (GIS) modeling techniques to identify areas meeting a set of conditions based on (1) optimum abiotic and biotic conditions favorable for revegetation of Sagebrush; (2) potential to increase connectivity of Sagebrush habitats in the landscape to benefit wildlife; (3) location of population strongholds for Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus, a species of conservation concern); and (4) potential impediments to successful restoration created by Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum, an invasive exotic annual grass).

Correlational evidence supports this, but evidence of causality is lacking. We reduced parasite loads in eight meerkat Suricata suricatta groups, generating a substantial decrease in grooming. Contrary to the predictions, overall antagonism did not increase. However, within group networks, grooming increased towards individuals who increased their antagonism. This was restricted to antagonism focused on social position, rather than access to physical resources. The treatment also increased an alternative placatory behaviour: unprompted submissions. Following treatment, individuals performed higher rates of guarding and marking behaviours, suggesting that they were stressed. A reduction in opportunity to mediate stress through grooming may explain local rises in antagonism and corresponding increases in placatory behaviours. We suggest that meerkats use allogrooming (and submissions) as a facultative response to antagonism, rather than a pre-emptive strategy to avert it by establishing a network of associations, as has been suggested for primates.",16,2009,276,1660,1263,1268"Gillson, L; Ekblom, A; Willis, KJ; Froyd, C","Holocene palaeo-invasions: the link between pattern, process and scale in invasion ecology?",LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,Review,"Invasion ecology has made rapid progress in recent years through synergies with landscape ecology, niche theory, evolutionary ecology and the ecology of climate change.

Consistent with previous studies, diversity was maximized at intermediate frequencies of disturbance in the absence of parasitic bacteriophages (phages). By contrast, no relationship was found between diversity and disturbance frequency in the presence of phage.

The inhibitory activity of trans-cinnamic acid was enhanced 17-fold when used in combination with 6.25 mug/ml (26.5 muM) of polygodial.

Although polygodial did not inhibit the activity of H+-ATPase in the plasma membrane fraction of roots in normally growing seedlings, a decrease in activity was found in the fraction obtained from seedlings incubated with 20 mug/ml of polygodial.

In the Himalaya it has mainly been explained by anthropogenic pressures. This study analyses the regeneration of two Quercus semecarpifolia Sm. forests (2-3000 m a.s.l.), where one forest has almost nil disturbance and the other has different degrees of canopy disturbance. The relationships between biotic and abiotic environmental variables and the number of Quercus semecarpifolia seedlings and saplings (i.e., recruits < 10 cm Diameter at Breast Height (DBH)) were analysed by means of Generalized Additive Models (GAM). The two forests were compared with respect to size-class distributions of mature trees (i.e., > 10 cm DBH), and the number of recruits. The size-class distributions indicate that regeneration is most reliable in the nearly undisturbed forest. Most recruits were found under high canopy cover and high potential radiation. Canopy disturbance has a negative effect on the number of seedlings. Seedlings seem to prefer a pH of around 6, Loss-on-Ignition between 20 and 30 %, and total nitrogen between 2 and 3 %. In general, there were very few plots with saplings, and there was not a clear relationship between the number of saplings and the soil variables.

The North Fork gaging station (NFC) was used as a control to evaluate the effects of logging in the South Fork, in the 1970's, on annual sediment loads. In the most conservative treatment of the data, suspended loans increased by 212 percent over the total predicted for a 6-yr period commencing with the onset of logging. When the roles of the watersheds were preserved and the same analysis repeated to evaluate harvesting in the North Fork under California Forest Practice Rules in the 1990's, no significant increase was found at NFC in either annual suspended or bed load With the am,ent of automatic pumping samplers, we were able to sample sediment concentration much more frequently in the 1980's. This allowed storm event loads from control watersheds in the North Fork to be used in a new regression analysis for NFC. According to this more sensitive analysis, for the 7-yr period commencing with the onset of logging, the sum of the suspended storm loads at NFC was 89 percent higher than that predicted for the undisturbed condition. The much greater increase after logging in the South Fork is too great to be Explained by differences in sampling methods and in water years, and appears to be the result of differences in roan alignment, yarding methods, and stream protection zones. Similar analyses of storm event loads for each of the treated subwatersheds in the North Fork suggested increased suspended loans in all but one of the tributaries, but effects were relatively small or absent at the main stern locations. Of watersheds with less than 50 percent cut, only one showed a highly significant increase. The greater increase in sediment at NFC, compared to other main-stem stations, is largely explained by a 3,600-m(3) landslide that occurred in 1995 in a subwatershed that drains into the main stem just above NFC. Differences among tributary responses can be explained in terms of channel conditions. Analysis of an aggregated model simultaneously fit to all of the data shows that sediment load increases are correlated with flow increases after lagging. Field evidence suggests that the increased flows, accompanied by soil disruption and intense burning, accelerated erosion of unbuffered stream banks and channel headward expansion. Windthrow along buffered streams also appears to be important as a source of both woody debris and sediment. All roads in the North Fork are located on upper slopes and do not appear to be a significant source of sediment reaching the channels. The aggregated model permitted evaluation of certain types of cumulative effects. Effects of multiple disturbances on suspended loans were approximately additive and, with one exception, downstream changes were no greater than would hare been expected from the proportion of area disturbed. A tendency for main-stem channels to yield higher unit-area suspended loads was also detected but after logging this was no longer the case in the North Fork of Caspar Creek.",16,1998,,,55,69"Fox, R; Oliver, TH; Harrower, C; Parsons, MS; Thomas, CD; Roy, DB",Long-term changes to the frequency of occurrence of British moths are consistent with opposing and synergistic effects of climate and land-use changes,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,Article,"1. Species' distributions are likely to be affected by a combination of environmental drivers. We used a data set of 11 million species occurrence records over the period 1970-2010 to assess changes in the frequency of occurrence of 673 macro-moth species in Great Britain. Groups of species with different predicted sensitivities showed divergent trends, which we interpret in the context of land-use and climatic changes. 2. A diversity of responses was revealed: 260 moth species declined significantly, whereas 160 increased significantly. Overall, frequencies of occurrence declined, mirroring trends in less species-rich, yet more intensively studied taxa. 3. Geographically widespread species, which were predicted to be more sensitive to land use than to climate change, declined significantly in southern Britain, where the cover of urban and arable land has increased. 4. Moths associated with low nitrogen and open environments (based on their larval host plant characteristics) declined most strongly, which is also consistent with a land-use change explanation. 5. Some moths that reach their northern (leading edge) range limit in southern Britain increased, whereas species restricted to northern Britain (trailing edge) declined significantly, consistent with a climate change explanation. 6. Not all species of a given type behaved similarly, suggesting that complex interactions between species' attributes and different combinations of environmental drivers determine frequency of occurrence changes. 7. Synthesis and applications. Our findings are consistent with large-scale responses to climatic and land-use changes, with some species increasing and others decreasing. We suggest that landuse change (e. g. habitat loss, nitrogen deposition) and climate change are both major drivers of moth biodiversity change, acting independently and in combination. Importantly, the diverse responses revealed in this species-rich taxon show that multifaceted conservation strategies are needed to minimize negative biodiversity impacts of multiple environmental changes. We suggest that habitat protection, management and ecological restoration can mitigate combined impacts of land-use change and climate change by providing environments that are suitable for existing populations and also enable species to shift their ranges.",15,2014,51,4,949,957"Byrne, M; Ho, MA; Koleits, L; Price, C; King, CK; Virtue, P; Tilbrook, B; Lamarek, M",Vulnerability of the calcifying larval stage of the Antarctic sea urchin Sterechinus neumayeri to near-future ocean acidification and warming,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Article,"Stenothermal polar benthic marine invertebrates are highly sensitive to environmental perturbations but little is known about potential synergistic effects of concurrent ocean warming and acidification on development of their embryos and larvae. We examined the effects of these stressors on development to the calcifying larval stage in the Antarctic sea urchin Sterechinus neumayeri in embryos reared in present and future (2100+) ocean conditions from fertilization. Embryos were reared in 2 temperature (ambient: -1.0 degrees C, + 2 degrees C:1.0 degrees C) and 3 pH (ambient: pH 8.0, -0.2-0.4 pH units: 7.8,7.6) levels. Principle coordinates analysis on five larval metrics showed a significant effect of temperature and pH on the pattern of growth. Within each temperature, larvae were separated by pH treatment, a pattern primarily influenced by larval arm and body length. Growth was accelerated by temperature with a 20-28% increase in postoral (PO) length at +2 degrees C across all pH levels. Growth was strongly depressed by reduced pH with a 8-19% decrease in PO length at pH 7.6-7.8 at both temperatures. The boost in growth caused by warming resulted in larvae that were larger than would be observed if acidification was examined in the absence of warming. However, there was no significant interaction between these stressors. The increase in left-right asymmetry and altered body allometry indicated that decreased pH disrupted developmental patterning and acted as a teratogen (agent causing developmental malformation). Decreased developmental success with just a 2 degrees C warming indicates that development in S. neumayeri is particularly sensitive to increased temperature. Increased temperature also altered larval allometry. Altered body shape impairs swimming and feeding in echinoplutei. In the absence of adaptation, it appears that the larval phase may be a bottleneck for survivorship of S. neumayeri in a changing ocean in a location where poleward migration to escape inhospitable conditions is not possible.",15,2013,19,7,2264,2275"Benson, JF; Patterson, BR; Wheeldon, TJ",Spatial genetic and morphologic structure of wolves and coyotes in relation to environmental heterogeneity in a Canis hybrid zone,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,Article,"Eastern wolves have hybridized extensively with coyotes and gray wolves and are listed as a species of special concern in Canada.

Accordingly, we studied resident wolves and coyotes in and adjacent to APP to identify distinct Canis types, clarify the extent of the APP eastern wolf population beyond the park boundaries and investigate fine-scale spatial genetic structure and landscapegenotype associations in the hybrid zone. We documented three genetically distinct Canis types within the APP region that also differed morphologically, corresponding to putative gray wolves, eastern wolves and coyotes. We also documented a substantial number of hybrid individuals (36%) that were admixed between 2 or 3 of the Canis types. Breeding eastern wolves were less common outside of APP, but occurred in some unprotected areas where they were sympatric with a diverse combination of coyotes, gray wolves and hybrids. We found significant spatial genetic structure and identified a steep cline extending west from APP where the dominant genotype shifted abruptly from eastern wolves to coyotes and hybrids. The genotypic pattern to the south and northwest was a more complex mosaic of alternating genotypes.

We evaluated the association of MPAs, herbivorous fish biomass, substrate type, postdisturbance coral cover, and change in macroalgal cover with coral recovery on the fringing reefs of the inner Seychelle islands, where coral mortality after a 1998 bleaching event was extensive. We visually estimated benthic cover and fish biomass at 9 sites in MPAs where fishing is banned and at 12 sites where fishing is permitted in 1994, 2005, 2008, and 2011. We used analysis of variance to examine spatial and temporal variations in coral cover and generalized additive models to identify relations between coral recovery and the aforementioned factors that may promote recovery. Coral recovery occurred on all substrate types, but it was highly variable among sites and times. Between 2005 and 2011 the increase in coral cover averaged 1%/year across 21 sites, and the maximum increase was 4%/year. However, mean coral cover across the study area (14%) remained at half of 1994 levels (28%). Sites within MPAs had faster rates of coral recovery than sites in fished areas only where cover of macroalgae was low and had not increased over time. In MPAs where macroalgae cover expanded since 1998 there was no recovery. Where coral was recovering on granite reefs there was a shift in relative prevalence of colony life-form from branching to encrusting species.

However, we know little about the overall trends of such responses, the GC drivers involved and the plant attributes affected. We synthesized literature to answer the question: Does soil heterogeneity significantly affect plant responses to main GC drivers, such as elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (CO2), nitrogen (N) enrichment and changes in rainfall regime? Overall, most studies have addressed short-term effects of N enrichment on the performance of model plant communities using experiments conducted under controlled conditions. The role of soil heterogeneity as a modulator of plant responses to elevated CO2 may depend on the plasticity in nutrient uptake patterns. Soil heterogeneity does interact with N enrichment to determine plant growth and nutrient status, but the outcome of this interaction has been found to be both synergistic and inhibitory. The very few studies published on interactive effects of soil heterogeneity and changes in rainfall regime prevented us from identifying any general pattern. We identify the long-term consequences of soil heterogeneity on plant community dynamics in the field, and the ecosystem-level responses of the soil heterogeneity x GC driver interaction, as the main knowledge gaps in this area of research. To fill these gaps and take soil heterogeneity and GC research a step forward, we propose the following research guidelines: (i) combining morphological and physiological plant responses to soil heterogeneity with field observations of community composition and predictions from simulation models and (ii) incorporating soil heterogeneity into a trait-based response-effect framework, where plant-resource-use traits are used as both response variables to this heterogeneity and GC, and predictors of ecosystem functioning.

Does grazing favour plants with arid affinity over those with less arid affinity? Does the grazing-induced transformation constitute a switch to the equivalent of a shrub-dominated biome? Location: Central South Africa. Methods: Using systematic scanning of SPOT 5 imagery and ground-truthing, a grazing treatment area was selected that met criteria of intensity of grazing, sampling requirements, and biogeographical position within a broad ecotonal zone. Differential vegetation responses to heavy grazing were tested for significant differences in plant traits, vegetation structure, and species diversity, richness and evenness. Gamma diversity was calculated for the whole study site, whereas, independent beta diversity was calculated across the treatments assuming the additive partitioning of diversity. In addition, the biogeographical association of grazing-induced species shifts was determined using a range of available databases. Results: Canopy cover and height of woody shrubs increased significantly with heavy grazing whereas that of graminoid plants declined. The resultant species turnover was modest, apparent extinctions of local species were minimal, species richness was maintained and species diversity was significantly enhanced. There was a significant increase in species evenness, through possible suppression of dominant species. Significant increases in species cover were those associated with mainly the Nama-Karoo biome indicating that species from more arid areas are more resistant to grazing as would be expected by the convergence model of aridity and grazing resistance. Conclusions: The significant increase in shrub cover in heavily grazed semi-arid grassland followed general global expectations. The study confirmed that the supposed former large shift of grassland to shrubby Nama-Karoo in the eastern upper Karoo can indeed be readily affected by heavy grazing. The negative connotations for biodiversity that have often been associated with intense grazing seem, in terms of the positive responses of plant species diversity in this study, to perhaps be exaggerated.

Better understanding of the mechanisms affecting demographic variation in ungulate populations is needed to support sustainable management of harvested populations. While studies of moose Alces alces L. populations have previously explored temporal variation in demographic processes, managers responsible for populations that span large heterogeneous landscapes would benefit from an understanding of how demography varies across biogeographical gradients in climate and other population drivers. Evidence of thresholds in population response to manageable and un-manageable drivers could aid resource managers in identifying limits to the magnitude of sustainable change. 2. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to evaluate the relative importance of population density, habitat abundance, summer and winter climatic conditions, primary production, and harvest intensity in explaining spatial variation in moose vital rates in Ontario, Canada. Tree regression was used to test for thresholds in the magnitudes of environmental predictor variables that significantly affected population vital rates. 3. Moose population growth rate was negatively related to moose density and positively related to the abundance of mixed deciduous habitat abundant in forage. Calf recruitment was negatively related to a later start of the growing season and calf harvest. The ratio of bulls to cows was related to male harvest and hunter access, and thresholds were evident in predictor variables for all vital rate models. 4. Findings indicate that the contributions of density-dependent and independent factors can vary depending on the scale of population process. The importance of density dependence and habitat supply to low-density ungulate populations was evident, and management strategies for ungulates may be improved by explicitly linking forest management and harvest. Findings emphasize the importance of considering summer climatic influences to ungulate populations, as recruitment in moose was more sensitive to the timing of vegetation green-up than winter severity. The efficacy of management decisions for harvested ungulates may require regional shifts in targets where populations span bioclimatic gradients. The use of GAMs in combination with recursive partitioning was demonstrated to be an informative analytical framework that captured nonlinear relationships common in natural processes and thresholds that are relevant to population management in diverse systems.",15,2011,80,6,1288,1298"Freese, HM; Schink, B",Composition and Stability of the Microbial Community inside the Digestive Tract of the Aquatic Crustacean Daphnia magna,MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,Article,"Small filter-feeding zooplankton organisms like the cladoceran Daphnia spp. are key members of freshwater food webs.

In addition, the diversity and stability of the intestinal microbial community were investigated over time, with different food sources as well as under starvation stress and death, and were compared to the community in the cultivation water. The diversity of the Daphnia gut microbiota was low. The bacterial community consisted mainly of Betaproteobacteria (e.g. Limnohabitans sp.), few Gammaproteobacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas sp.) and Bacteroidetes that were related to facultatively anaerobic bacteria, but did not contain typical fermentative or obligately anaerobic gut bacteria. Rather, the microbiota was constantly dominated by Limnohabitans sp. which belongs to the Lhab-A1 tribe (previously called R-BT065 cluster) that is abundant in various freshwaters. Other bacterial groups varied distinctly even under constant cultivation conditions. Overall, the intestinal microbial community did not reflect the community in the surrounding cultivation water and clustered separately when analysed via the Additive Main Effects and Multiplicative Interaction model. In addition, the microbiota proved to be stable also when Daphnia were exposed to bacteria associated with a different food alga. After starvation, the community in the digestive tract was reduced to stable members.

We used different spatial regression techniques to evaluate processes determining the invasion of the red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii. We evaluated four a priori hypotheses on processes that may determine crayfish invasion: landscape alteration, connectivity, wetland suitability for abiotic and biotic features. We assessed the distribution of P. clarkii in 119 waterbodies in a recently invaded area. We used spatially explicit statistical techniques (spatial eigen-vector mapping, generalized additive models, Bayesian intrinsic conditional autoregressive models) within an information-theoretic framework to assess the support of hypotheses; we also analyzed the pattern of spatial autocorrelation of data, model residuals, and eigenvectors. We found strong agreement between the results of spatial eigenvector mapping and Bayesian autoregressive models. Procambarus clarkii was significantly associated with the largest, permanent wetlands. Additive models suggested also association with human-dominated landscapes, but tended to overfit data. The results indicate that abiotic wetlands features and landscape alteration are major drivers of the species' distribution. Species distribution data, residuals of ordinary least squares regression, and spatial eigenvectors all showed positive and significant spatial autocorrelation at distances up to 2,500 m; this may be caused by the dispersal ability of the species. Our analyses help to understand the processes determining the invasion and to identify the areas most at risk where screening and early management efforts can be focused.

Evaluating the effectiveness of stream restoration is often challenging because of the lack of pre-treatment data, narrow focus on physicochemical measures and insufficient post-restoration monitoring. Even when these fundamental elements are present, quantifying restoration success is difficult because of the challenges associated with distinguishing treatment effects from seasonal variation, episodic events and long-term climatic changes. 2. We report results of one of the most comprehensive and continuous records of physical, chemical and biological data available to assess restoration success for a stream ecosystem in North America. Over a 17 year period we measured seasonal and annual changes in metal concentrations, physicochemical characteristics, macroinvertebrate communities, and brown trout Salmo trutta populations in the Arkansas River, a metal-contaminated stream in Colorado, USA. 3. Although we observed significant improvements in water quality after treatment, the effectiveness of restoration varied temporally, spatially and among biological response variables. The fastest recovery was observed at stations where restoration eliminated point sources of metal contamination. Recovery of macroinvertebrates was significantly delayed at some stations because of residual sediment contamination and because extreme seasonal and episodic variation in metal concentrations prevented recolonization by sensitive species. 4. Synthesis and applications. Because recovery trajectories after the removal of a stressor are often complex or nonlinear, long-term studies are necessary to assess restoration success within the context of episodic events and changes in regional climate. The observed variation in recovery among chemical and biological endpoints highlights the importance of developing objective criteria to assess restoration success. Although the rapid response of macroinvertebrates to reduced metal concentrations is encouraging, we have previously demonstrated that benthic communities from the Arkansas River remained susceptible to other novel anthropogenic stressors. We suggest that the resistance or resilience of benthic macroinvertebrate communities to novel stressors may be effective indicators of restoration success that can account for the non-additive (e.g. synergistic) nature of compound perturbations.",15,2010,47,4,899,910"Dmitriew, C; Blows, MW; Rowe, L",Ontogenetic Change in Genetic Variance in Size Depends on Growth Environment,AMERICAN NATURALIST,Article,"Within populations, the amount of environmental and genetic variation present may differ greatly among traits measured at multiple times over ontogeny. Brief periods of food deprivation are often followed by a period of accelerated (compensatory) growth. Early laboratory studies likewise reported a contraction of genetic variance in size as maturation approached. However, studies of wild populations often contradict these laboratory results. One possibility is that environmentally imposed stress is exposing genetic variance not seen in the laboratory. We tested the effect of rearing environment (high or low food) on genetic variance in size traits measured at two ages in the ladybird beetle Harmonia axyridis. A substantial amount of genetic variance was present in all combinations of rearing environment by ontogenetic stage among males. The pattern of change in male variance in mass over ontogeny was of opposite sign in the two food treatments, which may reflect cryptic genetic variance that is apparent only under stress. The proportion of overall variance that was due to additive genetic effects was much lower in females than in males, which suggests that the underlying genetics of female growth trajectories differs from that males.

However, although such impacts are expected to be scale-dependent in ecosystems with wide-roaming ungulates, scaling issues rarely enter empirical assessments. We here test the hypothesis that the impact of increased reindeer abundance on plant diversity in alpine tundra is scale-dependent. Based on potentially high productivity of the focal habitat units and hence the possibility of positive grazer impacts on plant diversity we predicted higher alpha and beta diversity at the habitat scale where reindeer densities are high. We also explored whether there were differences in diversity patterns at larger scales, including the scale of reindeer management districts. We estimated grazing disturbance as high versus low reindeer density in selected districts (a total extent of 7421 km(2)) of Northern Norway where reindeer-induced vegetation shifts are debated. We focus on dominance patterns because they can quantify the vegetation state and thus performed additive partitioning of Simpson diversity on multiple scales assessing also species' contributions to diversity. Contrary to our predictions, we found only weak scale-dependent effects of reindeer grazing on plant diversity. Under high reindeer densities there was evidence for a landscape-scale homogenization of the vegetation, but the predicted alpha and beta diversity increases at the habitat scale were not found. Consistently through all scales considered, four shrub species contributed the most to plant diversity. These results contradict the idea that reindeer at high stocking densities induce shifts in plant species dominance in productive habitats.

Using Drosophila melanogaster, we measure how selection on 20 mutant alleles is affected by direct and indirect genetic factors across two environments. We find that environmental stress increases selection against individual mutations but reduces selection against combinations of mutations (i.e., epistasis becomes more positive).

Chao Jaccard indices revealed high species turnover, and a consistently higher similarity within the sites at the lowest and within the highest elevation sites. Ordination identified altitude, aspect, slope, water proximity, cattle and trails as significant explanatory variables of species patterns, and showed that sites at lower elevations were clearly separated from the other sites. Environmental heterogeneity alone did not control species diversity distribution, but species were affected by environmental filters at different stages in their life cycle, e.g., water proximity was significant for saplings and seedlings but not for adults. Anthropogenic disturbances act synergistically, e.g., trails played a key role in determining structure and tree diversity patterns.

The extent and configuration of native vegetation is typically mapped using remote sensing, and plant species and communities are typically mapped using statistical models built with explanatory variables derived from GIS layers. Such research has paid limited attention to the 'condition' of native vegetation and rarely are explanatory variables derived from satellite remote sensing and GIS layers used together to spatially predict vegetation characteristics. We calculated two independent metrics of vegetation condition using field data measured at each of 239 0.1 ha plots. These metrics of vegetation condition were used to develop two continuous maps of vegetation condition across an area of 260,000 ha using statistical models (generalised additive models, GAMs) built with explanatory variables derived from a range of sources including digital elevation models (DEMs), metrics of landscape connective, land use mapping and satellite remote sensing.

Methods: Using a new method for the quantification of developmental instability, we compare homozygous strains of Drosophila mereatorum (either parthenogenetic or highly inbred) and of their F1 progeny for the analysis of a symmetrical meristic trait (sternopleural bristle number). The method also implies the choice of samples in which the left-right correlation is close to zero. Conclusions: In the parthenogenetic strain, developmental instability was seven times greater than in the F1 progeny. In the highly inbred strain, developmental instability was only 2.6 times greater than in the F1 progeny. The greater developmental instability in the parthenogenetic strain may be accounted for by the immediate fixation of a large number of deleterious alleles. In the inbred strain, on the other hand, progressive inbreeding is likely to have purged the genome of some of its genetic load and its most deleterious variants. The greater developmental instability in the parthenogenetic and inbred strains implies a non-linear relationship between heritability (h(2)) and additive genetic variance (sigma(2)(a)) (which are both related to evolutionary potential), which is discussed in an evolutionary context. A linear relationship between the sigma(2)(a) of a trait and its h(2) is expected if developmental instability is constant and independent of the sigma(2)(a) of that trait. If the relationship between the sigma(2)(a) of a trait and its developmental instability is negative, an increased sigma(2)(a), which is in the numerator of the h equation, will imply a reduced phenotypic variability (sigma(2)(p)), which is in the denominator of the heritability equation. Consequently, the concomitant increase in sigma(2)(s) and reduction in sigma(2)(s) both contribute to an increase in sigma(2)(p) and therefore an increase in evolutionary potential.",15,2006,8,8,1487,1498"Vermeulen, CJ; Bijlsma, R",Changes in genetic architecture during relaxation in Drosophila melanogaster selected on divergent virgin life span,JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,Article,"Artificial selection experiments often confer important information on the genetic correlations constraining the evolution of life history.

Here, we reinvestigate direct and correlated responses in a set of lines of Drosophila melanogaster that were selected on virgin life span and for which selection has been relaxed for 10 years. The decrease in progeny production in long-lived lines, a strong indication of antagonistic pleiotropy, had disappeared during relaxation. This was associated with a higher cost of reproduction to long-lived flies in mated, but not in virgin life span. These data strongly suggest that genetic mechanisms of mated and virgin life span determination are partly independent. Furthermore, data on body weight, developmental time and viability indicated deleterious effects of longevity selection in either direction, giving rise to a nonlinear relationship with life span for these characters. In order to reclaim original patterns, we founded a new set of derived lines by resuming selection in mixed replicate lines of the original set.

The assumption is that C dynamics can be modeled within homogenous ( i. e., even- aged ) patches and then summed to predict broad- scale dynamics ( an additive approach ). The goal of this paper is to elucidate the scales over which this additive approach is sufficient to explain observed C dynamics at broad scales. We define emergent "" behaviors"" ( vs. emergent "" properties"" ) as those behaviors that cannot be predicted solely from the additive properties of units at a finer scale. We used a forest process model to check for possible emergent behaviors due to pattern-process interactions at multiple levels, from the patch to the landscape. Specifically, using artificial forest landscapes with various spatial structures, we estimated the relative effects of edge- induced, tree mortality ( mainly due to wind ) and light limitations on C dynamics. Emergent behaviors were observed at all levels examined, indicating that emergent behaviors did not cease as one proceeded from the patch to the landscape level, as we had expected. However, the magnitude of the emergent behaviors depended on the level of spatial interaction considered as well as the type and intensity of the processes included. In all simulations, interactions of light and wind processes resulted in significant emergent behaviors only when parameters controlling wind mortality were set to the highest levels observed in the literature. In one simulation, the magnitude of emergent behaviors differed among the landscapes, indicating that interactions among patches may not be accounted for by an additive correction for edge effects unless spatial interactions are addressed. The implication is that some C dynamics in fragmented landscapes may not be captured at broad- scales using an additive approach, whereas in other cases spatial interactions are small enough to be ignored.",15,2003,18,7,701,721"Gergel, SE",Assessing cumulative impacts of levees and dams on floodplain ponds: A neutral-terrain model approach,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,Article,"Nearly all large rivers and their floodplains in the Northern Hemisphere are subject to multiple disturbances such as levees, impoundments, channelization, dams, and chances in land use. Isolating the relative impact of different disturbances is difficult when the combined effects are nonadditive. I developed a ""neutral-terrain model"" to examine the cumulative impacts of levees and dams on the hydroperiod of ponds and wetlands that form throughout floodplains after flood events. Using simulated floods of different magnitude, I address two major questions: (1) What is the relative influence of levees vs. dams on the duration and abundance of temporary ponds and wetlands? (2) Are the cumulative effects of levees and dams additive, synergistic, or antagonistic? Levees decreased the area occupied by temporary ponds (as compared to the natural scenario), until the levee was breached by large-magnitude events. When the levee was breached, no differences were found between the natural- and levee-floodplain scenarios. A simulated upstream dam decreased, increased, or had no effect on the area occupied by temporary ponds, depending on flood magnitude. Synergistic interactions between levees and dams were apparent for larger floods, where the reduction in flood stage caused by an upstream dam prevented levee breaching. Lastly, I introduce a qualitative framework for understanding the impacts of levees and dams on the duration of floodplain ponds.

In addition, interactions between genetic and environmental factors may affect the predictions of such models. Individuals of unknown genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana, ecotype Marburg, were-exposed to five levels of chemical (EMS) mutagenesis and three levels of Pseudomonas syringae infection. Survival, growth and flowering characteristics of each individual were measured. The logarithm of fitness is expected to be a linear function of mutation number if mutations act independently. Furthermore, the expected number of mutations should be approximately a linear function of time of exposure to mutagen. Therefore, nonlinear effects of mutagen exposure on the logarithm of fitness characters would suggest epistasis between mutations. Similarly, if pathogen infection and mutation act independently of each other, their effects should be additive on a log scale. Statistical interactions between these factors would suggest they do not act independently; particularly, if highly mutated individuals suffer more when infected than do less mutated individuals, this, suggests that pathogens and mutations act synergistically. Pseudomonas-infected individuals were shown to have an increased probability of flowering under-conditions of short day length, but to ultimately produce fewer flowers than uninfected individuals. This suggests a plastic response to stress and, despite that response, an ultimately deleterious effect of infection on fitness. Leaf rosette growth was negatively and linearly related to the expected number of mutations, and the effects of mutation on different life-cycle stages appeared to be uncorrelated. No significant interactions between pathogen and mutation main effects were found.

Tissues from canopy microsites which are regularly exposed to a greater range of irradiance, temperature and osmotic stresses than tissues from understory microsites had greater capacity to recover from these stresses alone or in combination compared to tissues from understory microsites. This, the first multifactorial analysis of physiological recovery from emersion stresses for any macroalgae, revealed the synergistic effects of high irradiance and temperature stresses while suggesting that enhanced temperature tolerance upon desiccation is not a universal feature of macroalgae at high tidal elevations. Net photosynthesis was enhanced by 20% water loss or exposure to 2150 mosM.kg(-1) media compared to values for tissues that were in a fully immersed state. Osmolarities in the range 200-3500 mosM.kg(-1) had a minimal negative impact on net photosynthesis. The temperature optimum for net photosynthesis was 33 degrees C while the upper performance threshold was 40 degrees C. Highly responsive stress acclimation capacity coupled with microclimate benefits of a turf form may substantially contribute to the ecological success of this species as an ecological dominant at high tidal elevations in the Hawaiian archipelago. Additionally, this diminutive physiological gradient emphasizes the differences in environmental pressures between high tidal amplitude, low-irradiance temperate regions and low tidal amplitude, high-irradiance tropical regions.

The tested climatic conditions were between the critical maxima and minima of streamside salamanders; thus, this experiment quantified the long-term effects of climate change within the noncritical range of this species. Despite a suite of behavioral adaptations to warm and dry conditions (e.g., burrowing, refuge use, huddling with conspecifics, and a reduction in activity), streamside salamanders exhibited significant loss of mass and significant mortality in all but the cool and moist conditions, which were closest to the climatic conditions in which they are most active in nature. A temperature of 27 degrees C represented a greater mortality risk than dry conditions; death occurred rapidly at this temperature and more gradually under cool and dry conditions. Foraging decreased under dry conditions, which suggests there were opportunity costs to water conservation. Exposure to the herbicide atrazine additively decreased water-conserving behaviors, foraging efficiency, mass, and time to death. Hence, the hypothesis that moderate climate change can cause population declines is even more plausible under scenarios with multiple stressors.

Water-retention additives have the potential to increase substrate water availability leading to greater plant growth and survival, expanding the range of plant species suitable for green roofs. We determined whether two different water-retention additives (silicate granules and hydrogel) increased substrate WHC, plant available water (PAW), days until permanent wilting and growth of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L) and white lupin (Lupinus albus L) grown in green roof substrates. Two substrates were compared; one based on scoria, the other based on crushed terracotta roof-tiles. Without additives both substrates had similar WHC (40-43%) but PAW was lower in scoria than in roof-tile due to greater air-filled porosity (AFP) and lower bulk density in scoria. Silicates increased WHC in both scoria and roof-tile substrates, but hydrogel only improved scoria WHC. The effects of additives on PAW differed between plant species, with additives increasing PAW in both substrates for wheat but only in roof-tile for lupins. PAW was not significantly different between hydrogel and silicates. Although hydrogels increased substrate WHC and PAW there was no increase in time until wilting in either substrate.

It would be particularly useful to understand whether the synergistic effects of global and local stressors could be alleviated, leading to slower change or faster recovery, if conditions under the control of local management alone were managed (i.e. nutrient pollution). We utilized field-based mesocosms to manipulate CO2 (i.e. forecasted global concentrations) and nutrients (i.e. local pollution) to test the hypothesis that, where synergies exist, reducing one contributing stressor would limit the effect of the other. In testing this hypothesis, we considered the response of turfing algae, which can displace kelp forests on urbanized coastlines. Initial manipulations of CO2 and nutrient enrichment produced an anticipated synergistic effect on the biomass of turfing algae. Following exposure of algal turfs to a combination of enriched nutrients and CO2, a subsequent reduction in nutrients was able to substantially slow further increases in turf growth. Despite this substantial effect, the historical legacy of previous nutrient enrichment was evident as greater turf was maintained relative to ambient conditions (i.e. ambient CO2 and nutrients). Such legacies of past stressors may be stubborn (e.g. persist as intergenerational change) where the alternative state (i.e. turf algae) has substantial resilience to restorative actions. Synthesis and applications. As stressors accumulate across global to local scales, some combine to produce synergistic effects which cause changes of disproportionate ecological magnitude. While strong synergies attract heavy scrutiny, there remains substantial merit in assessing whether their influence can be ameliorated by managing a contributing stressor. Of note, we show that by reducing a locally determined stressor (nutrients), its synergistic effects with a globally determined stressor (CO2 enrichment) on a key taxon (turf algae) may be substantially reduced.

Fertilization using gametes from multiple parents, to represent populations of spawners, was resilient to both stressors, as were cleavage stage embryos. Warming increased developmental rate across all pH levels. For blastulae, there was a complex interaction between stressors, with +4 degrees C/pH 7.6 lethal to many embryos. A 4 degrees C warming increased mortality by the gastrulation stage by 13 to 25% across all pH levels. In conjunction with warming, pH 7.6 increased mortality by 25 to 27% across all temperatures. For embryos that reached the 3 d bipinnaria stage, warming reduced the percentage of normal larvae and larval size, with no effect of acidification. These results highlight the importance of considering both warming and acidification, and effects on early embryos, in assessing life history responses to ocean change.

The compositional species turnover (0.36-0.94 SD) is relatively low in comparison to the species reorganizations known from the periods during the mid-and early-Holocene (0.64-1.61 SD) on the SE Plateau, and also in comparison to turnover rates of sediment records from climate-sensitive regions in the circum arctic. Our results indicate that climatically induced ecological thresholds are not yet crossed, but that human activity has an increasing influence, particularly on the terrestrial ecosystem in our study area. Synergistic processes of post-Little Ice Age warming, 20th century climate warming and extensive reforestations since the 19th century have initiated a change from natural oak-pine forests to seminatural, likely less resilient pine-oak forests. Further warming and anthropogenic disturbances would possibly exceed the ecological threshold of these ecosystems and lead to severe ecological consequences.",14,2011,17,11,3376,3391"Ernoult, A; Alard, D",Species richness of hedgerow habitats in changing agricultural landscapes: are alpha and gamma diversity shaped by the same factors?,LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,Article,"Understanding the determinants of hedgerow plant diversity in agricultural landscapes remains a difficult task, because the potential drivers affect the complete range of biodiversity components (alpha to gamma diversity). We surveyed herbaceous plant communities (of a height < 1.5 m) in 84 hedgerows in the Seine river floodplain of France. Two types of potential drivers for species richness, accounting for landscape mosaic and hedgerow network, were recorded at both hedgerow and site scale. The distribution of species richness through the components of alpha hedgerow diversity (i.e. the average diversity within a habitat) and gamma hedgerow diversity (i.e. the total diversity across habitats) were assessed using additive partitioning methods, while the relationship between species diversity and its potential landscape drivers at both scales was modeled using Generalized Additive Models. Our results indicated that gamma hedgerow diversity is explained by the heterogeneity of the landscape structure, which is correlated with the mosaic of agricultural land use. At this scale, intrinsic properties of the configuration of the hedgerow networks have a weak influence on species richness. Alpha hedgerow diversity is also explained by landscape variables, accounting for both the configuration of agricultural mosaics and hedgerow networks, but to a lesser extent. Time lags for species responses are shown at both scales, and for the two types of drivers. Extinction or colonization debt may be indicated at both scales, while the remnant effects of former practices may also be responsible for such patterns at a local scale. We suggest that hedgerow management should take the specific parameters of both scales into account. At a local scale, management actions should aim to decrease the influence of adjacent land use when the impact is negative, through the implementation of extended buffer zones, while at the landscape and farm scales, agri-environmental schemes should be dedicated to the conservation of specific agricultural land uses.",14,2011,26,5,683,696"Zhang, QG; Buckling, A",Antagonistic coevolution limits population persistence of a virus in a thermally deteriorating environment,ECOLOGY LETTERS,Letter,"P>Understanding the conditions under which rapid evolutionary adaptation can prevent population extinction in deteriorating environments (i.e. evolutionary rescue) is a crucial aim in the face of global climate change. Despite a rapidly growing body of work in this area, little attention has been paid to the importance of interspecific coevolutionary interactions. Antagonistic coevolution commonly observed between hosts and parasites is likely to retard evolutionary rescue because it often reduces population sizes, and results in the evolution of costly host defence and parasite counter-defence. We used experimental populations of a bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 and a bacteriophage virus (SBW25 Theta 2), to study how host-parasite coevolution impacts viral population persistence in the face of gradually increasing temperature, an environmental stress for the virus but not the bacterium. The virus persisted much longer when it evolved in the presence of an evolutionarily constant host genotype (i.e. in the absence of coevolution) than when the bacterium and virus coevolved. Further experiments suggest that both a reduction in population size and costly infectivity strategies contributed to viral extinction as a result of coevolution.

The imminent onset of climate change will exacerbate these impacts, placing even greater pressure on already stressed resources and regions. A plethora of national climate change policies have been adopted that emphasize structural adjustment in the energy sector and increasing carbon sinks. To date, most public debate on water has focused on the direct impacts of climate change on hydrology. However, there is growing evidence that climate change policies themselves may have substantial additional and negative impacts on freshwater resources and ecosystems and may thus result in maladaptation. To avoid such maladaptation, integrated, coordinated policy making is required. In this paper, national climate change policies from Australia, Brazil, China, the European Union (EU), India, Mexico, South Africa, Tanzania, and the United Kingdom are compared to: (i) identify where negative trade-offs exist between climate change policies and freshwater resources, (ii) analyze where institutions and structures exist to optimize integration among climate, water, and biodiversity policies, and (iii) provide a much needed overview from a broad selection of countries with a view to identifying further opportunities for theoretical exploration and testing. The synergies and conflicts among climate, energy, water, and environmental policies create additional challenges for governments to develop integrated policies to deliver multiple benefits. Success factors for better policy development identified in this assessment and synthesis include engagement of senior political leaders, cyclical policy development, multi-agency and stakeholder processes, and stronger accountability and enforcement measures.",14,2011,16,2,,"Bradbury, RB; Stoate, C; Tallowin, JRB",Lowland farmland bird conservation in the context of wider ecosystem service delivery,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,Letter,"P>1.

We explore the extent to which land management for farmland bird conservation provides 'cultural' ES, before assessing the potential consistency between management for bird species conservation and for a suite of ES that relate to the regulation of ecosystem processes. 3. We discuss the potential for co-delivery and trade-offs between farmland bird conservation and regulating ES, at a range of locations and spatial scales. 4. Potentially, action to enhance regulating services could provide some co-benefits for farmland bird conservation. However, more targeted management will still be required for certain species. 5.

Although the exact mechanisms by which global change will affect these systems are not known, models that simulate component drivers, particularly at a broad spatial scale, can nevertheless allow for more informed conservation decision making. Such general inference is particularly needed for wetlands across the tropics, where less knowledge and fewer resources are available to mitigate the impacts on important conservation sites. Here we develop a case study of wetland loss to sea level rise across tropical north Australia (including Ramsar-listed sites), and link these to a metapopulation model for a keystone endemic waterbird, the magpie goose Anseranas semipalmata. We projected published models on sea level rise through to the year 2400, and found a non-linear trajectory of inundation up to 20 m above present levels. Digital elevation models were used to simulate sea level rise and the spatially differentiated loss of wetland habitat used by geese. Range retraction was linked to decline in ecological carrying capacity, and we coupled wetland-specific habitat loss projections to a spatially explicit demographic metapopulation model. Additionally, we included alternate harvest strategies based on present-day estimates of indigenous and non-indigenous offtake of geese, and examined the synergy between wetland loss and hunting on extinction risk. Our results suggest that Australia's once-abundant and widespread magpie goose will be reduced to a fragmented population of just a few thousand individuals within the next 200-300 yr. Harvest could continue for some time, up to a ""tipping point'' at around 5% loss of current wetland habitat, after which the decline of geese is rapid. Given the inexorable nature of sea level rise, short-to medium-term conservation of waterbirds across Ramsar wetlands must prepare for adaptive wetland management, such as through buffer-placement, and ongoing monitoring of harvest.",14,2010,33,5,818,825"Relva, MA; Westerholm, CL; Kitzberger, T",Effects of introduced ungulates on forest understory communities in northern Patagonia are modified by timing and severity of stand mortality,PLANT ECOLOGY,Article,"Natural disturbances such as fires, windstorms, floods, and herbivory often act on plant communities, affecting their structure and the abundance and composition of their species. Most research has focused on the effects of single disturbances on plant communities whereas the synergistic effects of several disturbances have received less attention. In this study, we evaluated how timing and severity of tree mortality modified plant use by introduced deer and early post-mortality successional trajectories in northern Patagonian conifer forests. We sampled understory composition and deer use in Austrocedrus chilensis (cipr,s de la cordillera) forest stands undergoing varying timing and severity of forest mortality as reconstructed using dendroecological techniques. In addition, we evaluated the effect of fallen logs on plant composition and deer use of plants by monitoring areas of massive dieback where fallen logs had been removed for fire hazard reduction, and nearby control areas not subjected to such removal. Stepwise regression analyses showed that history and severity of tree mortality strongly influence plant composition and deer use of plants. For deer use (with pellet counts and browsing index as response variables), results showed a positive relationship with degree of stand mortality and a negative relationship with cover of fallen logs. Similarly, cover of unpalatable shrub species was explained by canopy mortality history, whereas cover of palatable shrub species was positively associated with severity of canopy mortality. In areas where fallen logs had been removed, pellet counts were six times higher than those in control areas. Though total shrub species cover was similar between log removal and control areas, proportion of unpalatable shrubs increased in areas where fallen logs had been removed. In conclusion, deer use of plants was strongly limited by tall fallen logs, allowing palatable species to establish and grow. Fallen log removal accelerated deer entrance and changed understory composition toward more browse-resistant and unpalatable species. These results underscore the importance of considering the dynamics (timing, severity, and extent) of fallen woody debris influencing understory herbivory and post-disturbance succession. In addition, experimental results underpin the importance of maintaining snags and large woody debris in disturbed landscapes where salvage logging is a routine procedure.",14,2009,201,1,11,22"Garcia-Fayos, P; Bochet, E",Indication of antagonistic interaction between climate change and erosion on plant species richness and soil properties in semiarid Mediterranean ecosystems,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Article,"We analyzed the consequences of climate change and the increase in soil erosion, as well as their interaction on plant and soil properties in semiarid Mediterranean shrublands in Eastern Spain. Current models on drivers of biodiversity change predict an additive or synergistic interaction between drivers that will increase the negative effects of each one. We used a climatic gradient that reproduces the predicted climate changes in temperature and precipitation for the next 40 years of the wettest and coldest end of the gradient; we also compared flat areas with 20 degrees steep hillslopes. We found that plant species richness and plant cover are negatively affected by climate change and soil erosion, which in turn negatively affects soil resistance to erosion, nutrient content and water holding capacity. We also found that plant species diversity correlates weakly with plant cover but strongly with soil properties related to fertility, water holding capacity and resistance to erosion. Conversely, these soil properties correlate weaker with plant species cover. The joint effect of climate change and soil erosion on plant species richness and soil characteristics is antagonistic. That is, the absolute magnitude of change is smaller than the sum of both effects. However, there is no interaction between climate change and soil erosion on plant cover and their effects fit the additive model. The differences in the interaction model between plant cover and species richness supports the view that several soil properties are more linked to the effect that particular plant species have on soil processes than to the quantity and quality of the plant cover and biomass they support. Our findings suggest that plant species richness is a better indicator than plant cover of ecosystems services related with soil development and protection to erosion in semiarid Mediterranean climates.",14,2009,15,2,306,318"Martone, RG; Wasson, K",Impacts and interactions of multiple human perturbations in a California salt marsh,OECOLOGIA,Article,"Multiple disturbances to ecosystems can influence community structure by modifying resistance to and recovery from invasion by non-native species. Predicting how invasibility responds to multiple anthropogenic impacts is particularly challenging due to the variety of potential stressors and complex responses. Using manipulative field experiments, we examined the relative impact of perturbations that primarily change abiotic or biotic factors to promote invasion in coastal salt marsh plant communities. Specifically we test the hypotheses that nitrogen enrichment and human trampling facilitate invasion of upland weeds into salt marsh, and that the ability of salt marsh communities to resist and/or recover from invasion is modified by hydrological conditions. Nitrogen enrichment affected invasion of non-native upland plants at only one of six sites, and increased aboveground native marsh biomass at only two sites. Percent cover of native marsh plants declined with trampling at all sites, but recovered earlier at tidally flushed sites than at tidally restricted sites. Synergistic interactions between trampling and restricting tidal flow resulted in significantly higher cover of non-native upland plants in trampled plots at tidally restricted sites. Percent cover of non-native plants recovered to pre-trampling levels in fully tidal sites, but remained higher in tidally restricted sites after 22 months. Thus, perturbations that reduce biotic resistance interact with perturbations that alter abiotic conditions to promote invasion. This suggests that to effectively conserve or restore native biodiversity in altered systems, one must consider impacts of multiple human disturbances, and the interactions between them.",14,2008,158,1,151,163"Donner, DM; Probst, JR; Ribic, CA","Influence of habitat amount, arrangement, and use on population trend estimates of male Kirtland's warblers",LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,Article,"Kirtland's warblers (Dendroica kirtlandii) persist in a naturally patchy environment of young, regenerating jack pine forests (i.e., 5-23 years old) created after wildfires and human logging activities. We examined how changing landscape structure from 26 years of forest management and wildfire disturbances influenced population size and spatial dispersion of male Kirtland's warblers within their restricted breeding range in northern Lower Michigan, USA. The male Kirtland's warbler population was six times larger in 2004 (1,322) compared to 1979 (205); the change was nonlinear with 1987 and 1994 identified as significant points of change. In 1987, the population trend began increasing after a slowly declining trend prior to 1987, and the rate of increase appeared to slow after 1994. Total amount of suitable habitat and the relative area of wildfire-regenerated habitat were the most important factors explaining population trend. Suitable habitat increased 149% primarily due to increasing plantations from forest management. The relative amount and location of wildfire-regenerated habitat modified the distribution of males among various habitat types, and the spatial variation in their abundance across the primary breeding range. These findings indicate that the Kirtland's warbler male population shifted its use of habitat types temporally and spatially as the population increased and as the relative availability of habitats changed through time. We demonstrate that researchers and managers need to consider not only habitat quality, but the temporal and the spatial context of habitat availability and population levels when making habitat restoration decisions.",14,2008,23,4,467,480"Trusilova, K; Churkina, G","The response of the terrestrial biosphere to urbanization: land cover conversion, climate, and urban pollution",BIOGEOSCIENCES,Article,"Although urban areas occupy a relatively small fraction of land, they produce major disturbances of the carbon cycle through land use change, climate modification, and atmospheric pollution.

Among urbanization-driven environmental changes, which influence carbon sequestration in the terrestrial biosphere, we account for: (1) proportion of land covered by impervious materials, (2) local urban meteorological conditions, (3) urban high CO(2) concentrations, and (4) elevated atmospheric nitrogen deposition. We use the terrestrial ecosystem model BIOME-BGC to estimate fluxes of carbon exchange between the biosphere and the atmosphere in response to these urban factors. We analysed four urbanization-driven changes individually, setting up our model in such a way that only one of the four was active at a time. From these model simulations we found that fertilization effects from the elevated CO(2) and the atmospheric nitrogen deposition made the strongest positive contributions to the carbon uptake (0.023 Pg C year(-1) and 0.039 Pg C year(-1), respectively), whereas, the impervious urban land and local urban meteorological conditions resulted in a reduction of carbon uptake (-0.005 Pg C year(-1) and -0.007 Pg C year(-1), respectively).

We asked whether (1) early successional stages were the most susceptible to C. selloana invasion; (2) soil microdisturbances increased invasion at any point of succession, and (3) C. selloana invasion of later successional stages was modulated by vegetation type Location: Delta del Llobregat (Catalonia, NE Spain). Methods: We monitored survival and growth of transplanted C. selloana seedlings in disturbed and non-disturbed plots throughout a successional gradient with an age range of < 1 to > 10 years in different vegetation types and within the area of influence of coexisting species with similar growth form. Results: Although seedling survival was extremely low in all treatments, our results revealed that early successional stages were not the most easily invaded since we found no significant differences in the percentage survival of C. selloana along the successional gradient. However, survival and seedling biomass were enhanced by soil disturbance at any seral stage. This result suggested that inhibition ruled C. selloana invasion. Invasibility neither depended on the invaded vegetation type nor on the co-existing species with similar growth form. Finally, C. selloana invasion was not enhanced by decreasing competition with Phragntites australis, a native coexisting species because survival rates after a year were not significantly different. However, Phragmites increased C. selloana leaf length probably due to shading.

We reared larval wood frogs from these populations and exposed experimental groups of eggs and larvae to one of three treatments: unfiltered sunlight, sunlight filtered through a UV-B-blocking filter (Mylar), and sunlight filtered through a UV-B-transmitting filter (acetate).

Furthermore, the interaction between UV-B treatment and genetic diversity significantly affected larval mortality. Populations with low genetic diversity experienced higher larval mortality rates when exposed to UV-B than did populations with high genetic diversity.

Little is known about the relationship between fire and an emerging disease epidemic called Sudden Oak Death, which is caused by a new pathogen, Phytophthora ramorum. This disease has spread across a large, fire-prone portion of California, killing great numbers of oaks and tanoaks and infecting most associated woody plants. Suitable hosts cover a much broader geographic range, raising concern over where the disease may spread. To understand the strength and potential sensitivities of a fire-disease relationship, we examined geographic patterns of confirmed P. ramorum infections in relation to past fire history. We found these infections to be extremely rare within the perimeter of any area burned since 1950. This finding is not caused by spatial bias in sampling for the disease, and is robust to variation in host abundance scenarios and to aggregation of closely spaced sampling locations. We therefore investigated known fire-related factors that could result in significantly lower incidence of the disease in relatively recently burned landscapes. Chemical trends in post-fire environments can influence the success of pathogens like P. ramorum, either by increasing plant nutrient stress or by reducing the occurrence of chemicals antagonistic to Phytophthoras. Succession in the absence of fire leads to greater abundance of host species, which will provide increased habitat for P. ramorum; this will also increase intraspecific competition where these trees are abundant, and other density-dependent effects (e.g. shading) can reduce resource allocation to defenses. Despite these findings about a fire-disease relationship, a much deeper understanding is necessary before fire can be actively used as a tool in slowing the epidemic.",14,2005,144,1,106,114"Prato, FS; Kavaliers, M; Thomas, AW; Ossenkopp, KP",Modulatory actions of light on the behavioural responses to magnetic fields by land snails probably occur at the magnetic field detection stage,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,Article,"The attenuation of opioid peptide-mediated antinociception or analgaesia is a well-established effect of extremely low frequency (ELF) magnetic fields.

Here, we investigated whether this modulatory effect of light occurs at either the magnetic field detection stage or is associated with a post-detection mechanism. We compared the effects of the presence and absence of light on the attenuation of opioid-induced analgaesia in the land snail, Cepaea nemoralis, by (i) an ELF magnetic field (15 min, 60 Hz, 141 mu T peak), and (ii) the prototypic opiate antagonist, naloxone.

The inhibitory effects of the ELF magnetic fields and naloxone on opioid-induced analgaesia were similar in the presence of light; whereas in the absence of light the inhibitory effects of the ELF magnetic fields as a percentage of sham were markedly reduced, while those of naloxone were unaffected.

Numerical simulations indicate rapid extinction due to synergistic interaction between inbreeding depression and declining population size for realistic ranges of per-locus mutation rate, equilibrium population size, intrinsic rate of population growth, and strength of demographic disturbances. Large populations at equilibrium are more liable to extinction when disturbed due to inbreeding depression than small populations.

We tracked changes in relative biomass within a coupled dynamic whole-ecosystem modeling framework that included the biophysical system, human effects, socioeconomics, and management evaluation. We estimated the individual, additive, and interactive effects on the ecosystem and for five community groups (top predators, fishes, benthic invertebrates, plankton, and primary producers). We calculated the size and direction of interaction effects with an additive null model and interpreted results as synergistic (amplified stress), additive (no additional stress), or antagonistic (reduced stress). Individually, only ocean acidification had a negative effect on total biomass. Fishing and ocean warming and ocean warming with ocean acidification had an additive effect on biomass. Adding fishing to ocean warming and ocean acidification significantly changed the direction and magnitude of the interaction effect to a synergistic response on biomass. The interaction effect depended on the response level examined (ecosystem vs. community). For communities, the size, direction, and type of interaction effect varied depending on the combination of stressors.

We assessed how climate change and forest management affect forest development and FGS for a diverse case-study landscape in Central Europe. Using a process-based forest model (LandClim) we simulated forest dynamics and FGS under a range of climate change and management scenarios in the Black Forest, Germany, which is shaped by various management practices. We focused on the interdependencies between timber production and forest diversity, the most valued FGS in this region. We found that the conversion to more drought-adapted forest types is required to prevent climate change-induced forest dieback and that this conversion must be the target of any adaptive management, especially in areas where monocultures of drought-sensitive Norway spruce (Picea abies) were promoted in the past. Forest conversion takes up to 120 years, however, with past and future adaptive management being the key drivers of timber and forest diversity provision. The conversion of drought-sensitive conifer monocultures maintains timber production in the short term and enhances a range of forest diversity indices. Using uneven-aged forest management that targets a drought-adapted, diverse, and resilient species mixture, high species diversity can be combined with timber production in the long term. Yet, the promotion of mature-stand attributes requires management restrictions. Selecting future adaptive management options thus implies the consideration of trade-offs between forest resource use and environmental objectives, but also the exploitation of synergies between FGS that occur during forest conversion. Lastly, the large impact of past management practices on the spatial heterogeneity of forest dynamics underpins the need to assess FGS provisioning at the landscape scale.",13,2012,22,8,2065,2077"Stabili, L; Cardone, F; Alifano, P; Tredici, SM; Piraino, S; Corriero, G; Gaino, E","Epidemic Mortality of the Sponge Ircinia variabilis (Schmidt, 1862) Associated to Proliferation of a Vibrio Bacterium",MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,Article,"In recent years, several episodes of mass mortality of sessile epibenthic invertebrates, including sponges, have been recorded worldwide.

The injured sponges showed wide necrotic areas on the surface or disruption of the body in several portions. Necrotic areas were whitish and often were covered with a thin mucous coat formed by bacteria. In the most affected specimens, sponge organisation resulted partial or complete loss, with the final exposure of the dense skeletal network of spongine fibres to the environment. The results of microbiological cultural analysis using in parallel Marine Agar 2216 and thiosulphate/citrate/bile salts/sucrose agar demonstrated that, in affected specimens, vibrios represented 15.8 % of the total I. variabilis surface culturable bacteria. Moreover, all the isolated vibrios, grown from the wide whitish areas that characterize the surface of the diseased sponges, were identified, and their assignment to the Vibrio rotiferianus was consistent with phylogenetic analysis and data of morphological, cultural and biochemical tests. Studies on V. rotiferianus have shown that its pathogenicity, with respect to various aquatic organisms, is higher than that of Vibrio harveyi. The factors triggering the disease outbreak in Ircinia variabilis populations remain unclear. At present, we can hypothesize the involvement in the disease of a synergetic mechanism that, under stressful physiological conditions (high temperature, elevated nutrients and reduced water flow), induces sponge pathogens, in our case V. rotiferanius, to become virulent, making sponges unable to control their proliferation. Additional studies are needed to understand the etiological processes as well as the factors involved in sponges recovering from this epidemic event allowing them to face mass mortality.

The seasonal timing and magnitude of temperature increases are important for seasonal biomass fluctuations of Daphnia and similarly influence the potential synchrony of daphnids and phytoplankton succession (the timing hypothesis). In light of the most recent studies on this topic, even a minor warming during short but critical seasonal periods can cause factors that disturb Daphnia population dynamics to coincide, which may destabilize lake food webs by decoupling trophic interactions. Both winter and spring are important critical periods for determining future seasonal fluxes of Daphnia spp. and, consequently, the time of the clear-water phase and the occurrence and duration of Daphnia midsummer decline. Winter conditions may also affect the impact of fish predation on daphnids during summer months. However, the effects of global warming on Daphnia population dynamics and on ecosystem functioning are often difficult to predict due to their complexity and the presence of both antagonistic and synergistic drivers. Thus, the diverse responses of daphnids to climate anomalies depend on both biotic (predator abundance and seasonal phytoplankton succession) and abiotic factors (e.g. hydrodynamics, intensity and duration of thermal stratification, trophic state or geomorphology) of lakes, which are directly influenced by weather changes. The analysis and quantification of such complex interactions require the involvement of different kinds of specialists and the development of accurate research approaches, such as molecular genetic methods or mathematical modelling.",13,2012,46,1,37,53"Shannon, G; Thaker, M; Vanak, AT; Page, BR; Grant, R; Slotow, R",Relative Impacts of Elephant and Fire on Large Trees in a Savanna Ecosystem,ECOSYSTEMS,Article,"Elephant and fire are considered to be among the most important agents that can modify the African savanna ecosystem. Although the synergistic relationship between these two key ecological drivers is well documented, it has proved much more difficult to establish the relative effects they have on savanna vegetation structure at a fine-scale over time. In this study, we explore the comparative impacts of fire and elephant on 2,522 individually identified large trees (5 m in height) in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Data were collected from 21 transects first surveyed in April 2006 and resurveyed in November 2008, to determine the relative importance of past damage by these agents on subsequent impacts and mortality. The occurrence of fire or elephant damage in 2006 affected the amount of tree volume subsequently removed by both these agents; elephant removed more tree volume from previously burned trees and the impact of subsequent fire was higher on previously burned or elephant-utilized trees than on undamaged trees. Mortality was also affected by an interaction between previous and recent damage, as the probability of mortality was highest for trees that suffered from fire or elephant utilization after being pushed over. Subsequent fire damage, but not elephant utilization, on debarked trees also increased the probability of mortality. Mortality was twice (4.6% per annum) that of trees progressing into the 5 m height class, suggesting an overall decline in large tree density during the 30-month study period. The responses of large trees were species and landscape-specific in terms of sensitivity to elephant and fire impacts, as well as for levels of mortality and progression into the 5 m height class.

Climate anomalies can further increase levels of habitat disturbance and act synergistically to elevate invasion risk. Herein, we use a historical data set from the upper San Francisco Estuary to provide the first empirical evidence for facilitation of invasions by climate extremes. Invasive zooplankton species did not become established in this estuary until the 1970s when increasing propagule pressure from Asia coincided with extended drought periods. Hydrological management exacerbated the effects of post-1960 droughts and reduced freshwater inflow even further, increasing drought severity and allowing unusually extreme salinity intrusions. Native zooplankton experienced unprecedented conditions of high salinity and intensified benthic grazing, and life history attributes of invasive zooplankton were advantageous enough during droughts to outcompete native species and colonise the system.

There is a pressing need for robust predictions of potential futures of coral reef and associated human systems under alternative management scenarios. Understanding and predicting the dynamics of coral reef systems at regional scales of tens to hundreds of kilometers is imperative, because reef systems are connected by physical and socioeconomic processes across regions and often across international boundaries. We present a spatially explicit regional-scale model of ecological dynamics for a general coral reef system. In designing our model as a tool for decision support, we gave precedence to portability and accessibility; the model can be parameterized for dissimilar coral reef systems in different parts of the world, and the model components and outputs are understandable for nonexperts. The model simulates local-scale dynamics, which are coupled across regions through larval connectivity between reefs. We validate our model using an instantiation for the Meso-American Reef system. The model realistically captures local and regional ecological dynamics and responds to external forcings in the form of harvesting, pollution, and physical damage (e.g., hurricanes, coral bleaching) to produce trajectories that largely fall within limits observed in the real system. Moreover, the model demonstrates behaviors that have relevance for management considerations. In particular, differences in larval supply between reef localities drive spatial variability in modeled reef community structure. Reef tracts for which recruitment is low are more vulnerable to natural disturbance and synergistic effects of anthropogenic stressors. Our approach provides a framework for projecting the likelihood of different reef futures at local to regional scales, with important applications for the management of complex coral reef systems.",13,2011,21,4,1380,1398"Trebilco, R; Halpern, BS; Flemming, JM; Field, C; Blanchard, W; Worm, B",Mapping species richness and human impact drivers to inform global pelagic conservation prioritisation,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,Article,"Given the widely recognized need to better protect the oceans but limited resources to do so, methods for prioritizing potential protected area sites are important. This is particularly true for the open oceans, where few protected areas currently exist and data availability is limited. Here, we examine the relationship between the distributions of tuna and billfish species richness (an indicator of pelagic biodiversity), the human impact drivers of fishing pressure (quantified as cumulative removals) and sea surface temperature increase (quantified as the increase in large positive anomalies) in tropical to temperate oceans at the scale of a 5 degrees x 5 degrees grid. We investigate relationships using Generalised Additive Models and Regression Tree analysis, and identify the top 50 ""hotspot"" cells for species richness and each of the two impact drivers. We find that both impact drivers significantly overlap with high species richness, but relationships are complex, non-linear and ocean-basin specific. Higher fishing pressure is associated with higher species richness in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and this overlap is particularly prominent in the central Pacific, and in the Indian Ocean around Sri Lanka. In the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, species richness is generally higher in areas that have seen lower levels of change in sea surface temperature and only one cell, near Easter Island, is a hotspot for species richness and sea surface temperature increase. While species richness and impact drivers overlap in some areas, there are many areas with high species richness and limited apparent impact. This suggests that area-based conservation strategies that aim to protect areas of high pelagic biodiversity may be achievable with limited displacement of fishing effort. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Bird data collected using the line transect method along hiking trails and in undisturbed control areas were related to number of visits, area of tourism infrastructure, and habitat variables.

Open-cup nesters breeding on the ground showed strongest negative response to visitor pressure, whereas the open-cup nesters nesting in trees and shrubs were more tolerant. For cavity-nesting species, recreation had no significant impact. The contribution of the number of visits was generally low also in models in which it was selected, and the occurrence of birds was mainly determined by habitat characteristics of the area.

Outbreak of hemlock woolly adelgid, Adelgies tsugae - HWA, is causing selective removal of eastern hemlock Tsuga canadensis at a regional scale. Impacts of outbreak-caused canopy mortality and shifts in dominant species on litter decay were compared across sites that range in HWA-caused canopy damage and subsequent canopy dominance by black birch Betula lenta. Senescent litter from eastern hemlock, black birch, and equal litter mixes were decomposed in the field for 36 months within nine sites in Connecticut and Massachusetts USA. Mass loss and % N accumulation of black birch was 65% and 52% greater compared to eastern hemlock. In contrast, outbreak related canopy damage increased litter mass loss by 11.5% in high mortality stands relative to uninfested stands but canopy damage had no impact on % N dynamics. Non-additive effects of litter mixing influenced chemical dynamics of decaying litter; black birch accumulated less N and eastern hemlock accumulated more N compared to each species decaying alone. However, these changes offset and mixed litter bags overall showed no differences in N dynamics compared to values from each species decaying alone. In eastern hemlock stands invaded by hemlock woolly adelgid, canopy damage influences the rates and dynamics of decay but species differences between hemlock and black birch leaf litter are the dominant mechanisms of decomposition changes and a long-lasting driver of increased N cycling rates.

Physiological and evolutionary responses underlying thermal adaptation and acclimation are often investigated under controlled laboratory conditions. Such studies may fail to assess ecologically relevant parameters as they do not account for the complexity of the natural environment. 2. We investigated a population of Drosophila melanogaster for performance at low temperature conditions in the field using release recapture assays and in the laboratory using standard cold resistance assays. The aim of the study was to get a better understanding of the nature and underlying mechanisms of the trait measured in field recapture studies and the association between field performance and fitness measures estimated in the laboratory. 3. We performed one generation of selection on the ability to reach a resource at low temperature under field conditions. Flies that reached a resource ('mobile') and those that never left the release site ('stationary') were reared to the F1 and F2 generation in the laboratory. Subsequent field releases with these flies demonstrated a clear genetic differentiation between mobile and stationary flies in their ability to reach resources at low temperatures in the field. This indicates that mobility at low temperature is under additive genetic influence. In contrast mobile and stationary flies were generally indistinguishable when tested in standard laboratory tests of cold performance. The genetic differentiation between the two sub-populations was not linked to allelic variation in known candidate genes for cold adaptation. However, using transcriptomics we identified new candidate genes (transcripts) and pathways that differed between the mobile and stationary flies. 4. The current study reveals an irregular relationship between cold performance in the field and in the laboratory.

Current knowledge about the ecology of the meiofauna and use of this component in applied ecological studies, along with the availability of a standardised protocol for the analysis of meiofaunal assemblages, allows us to recommend formal acknowledgement of the need to integrate information derived from the analysis of macrofauna with information derived from the study of meiofauna.

A fully factorial design was used with light (low/high levels), ammonium supply and phosphate preculture conditions of the plants as the experimental variables. Both ammonium supply and low light caused negative and synergistic effects on net production, while ammonium toxicity was more severe at high light levels; in this case, it was independent of the non-structural carbohydrate (sucrose and starch) content. Preculturing of plant with added phosphate alleviated the ammonium toxicity, and also attenuated the negative production balance of plants grown at low light levels. The results indicated that phosphate preculture ameliorated the plant's short-term response against the assayed stressors (low light, high ammonium) significantly. An overall consumption of non-structural carbohydrates in response to environmental stressors was recorded throughout the experiment, indicating the importance of carbon and phosphorus reserves to cope with adverse conditions. ln addition, phosphate deficiency increased the vulnerability of plants, which could have negative ecological consequences for seagrass species thriving under phosphate deficiency conditions, or in developing seagrass transplantation programs.",13,2008,365,,67,75"Sargian, P; Mas, S; Pelletier, E; Demers, S",Multiple stressors on an Antarctic microplankton assemblage: water soluble crude oil and enhanced UVBR level at Ushuaia (Argentina),POLAR BIOLOGY,Article,"Changes in phytoplankton pigment content, in vivo fluorescence as well as in abundance and cell characteristics of phyto- and bacterioplankton were investigated on a field-collected microplankton assemblage from Ushuaia Bay (Southern Argentina). Effects of different experimental treatments were examined: natural and enhanced ultraviolet-B radiation (UVBR: 280-320 nm) exposures, and water soluble fraction (WSF) of crude oil contamination under both UVBR exposures. After a 5-day exposure to experimental treatments in microcosms, significant UVBR-induced deleterious effects were observed with afternoon depression of the photochemical yield followed by night-time recovery. A significant increase in photoprotective pigments (PPCs) was also observed. Due to their smaller size, picophytoplankton cells appeared to be more impacted than nanophytoplankton cells as revealed by their increasing mean cell size and decreasing growth rate implying a perturbation of the cell cycle. On the other hand, the differential response between the two bacterial sub-populations identified (i.e., as sub-populations 1 and 2 according to their cellular characteristics) suggests a higher vulnerability for only one of these sub-populations to UVBR stress. WSF alone was also shown to induce deleterious effects on phytoplankton assemblage. Nevertheless, bacteria were positively affected, and particularly bacterial sub-population 2. The combination of WSF and enhanced UVBR exposure resulted in an exacerbation of these individual effects, demonstrating a synergistic effect of both stresses.

Females prefer males that provide a direct benefit: greater resistance to desiccation stress. Mating preferences also appear to have indirect consequences: daughters of preferred males have lower reproductive success than daughters of unpreferred males, although additional experimentation will be needed to determine if the indirect consequences of female preferences actually arise from 'sexually antagonistic' variation.

Elevation is often used as an indirect predictor of temperature, but this limits the applicability of environmental models to other study areas and introduces errors in mountainous terrain where variations in slope, aspect, and radiation can significantly alter the relationship between elevation and temperature. Some studies have developed estimates for temperature that also consider factors such as radiation, but these usually estimate the temperature for each location without considering the surrounding environment. in this study, average summer maximum and minimum temperatures were recorded at various locations on the Illawarra Escarpment, near Sydney, Australia. It was hypothesised that wind and air movements would average out large differences in elevation and radiation in mountainous terrain and cause the temperatures to be more strongly correlated with local averages of elevation and radiation than they are with the actual elevation and radiation where the temperatures were recorded. The use of local averages improved the estimate of average summer maximum temperature from a regression r(2) of 0.185 using elevation alone, to an gamma(2) of 0.685 when using canopy cover, local average elevation and local average radiation. In contrast, average summer minimum temperatures were better predicted using the elevation of each location without averaging. The results were applied to vegetation modelling by comparing a generalised additive model using the predicted average temperatures with a model using elevation. The overall classification accuracy for vegetation communities in the study area was improved from 46.4% to 61.8%.

This decline is caused by an increase in both abiotic (autotoxicity, harvesting pressure) and biotic stresses [fungal infections, mainly Fusarium crown and root rot (FCRR)]. To gain insight into disease development and possible mitigation strategies, we studied the effects of harvesting, time in the growing season, and field age on FCRR development, Fusarium species composition, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) communities in both a controlled field experiment and an ecological survey of commercial fields. In one experiment, a 3-year-old asparagus field was subdivided into plots that were harvested or not and sampled throughout the growing season to assess short-term dominant Fusarium species shifts. In addition, diseased and healthy asparagus plants sampled from six commercial fields in the same geographical region were used to assess Fusarium and AMF communities in relation to different parameters. Fusarium and AMF communities were described by using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) approach, and results were analyzed by mainly correspondence analysis and canonical correspondence analysis. Results showed that dominant Fusarium taxa assemblages changed throughout the growing season. Harvested plots had significantly more FCRR symptomatic plants at the end of the growing season, but this effect was not related with any trend in Fusarium community structure. Sampling site and plant age significantly influenced AMF community structure, whereas only sampling site consistently influenced the Fusarium community. Diseased and healthy plants harbored similar Fusarium and AMF communities. Shifts in Fusarium community might not be responsible for different disease incidence because they are ubiquitous regardless of plant health status or harvesting regime.

However, so-called inter-kingdom competition has rarely been the focus of ecological and evolutionary studies. Thus, a relatively novel hypothesis has been proposed on the basis that saprophagous insects might intensively compete with filamentous fungi for ephemeral resources (e.g. decaying plant tissue). Consideration that life history traits (e.g. developmental time) are adaptive in determining developmental success in the presence of con- or hetero-specifics competitors implies that these traits have been progressively established by natural selection. Because a similar scenario may apply to antagonistic interactions between saprophagous insects and filamentous fungi, one can expect the existence of heritable variation in developmental success when insect larvae are forced to grow in the presence of noxious mould. Therefore, this study aimed at discovering whether a local population of Drosophila melanogaster indeed harbours genetic variation in developmental success in the presence of the mould Aspergillus niger. By using the isofemale line technique, single larvae forced to feed on fungal infected or uninfected substrate were analysed for variation in survival probability to the adult stage, developmental time and body size of emerged adults. I found genetic variation in survival probability in fungal infected substrates but not in uninfected larval food sources. Mean developmental time and body size varied significantly among isofemale lines in both types of larval environment. Survival was negatively correlated with developmental time on fungal infected substrate, but variation in developmental time on fungal-free substrates was not correlated with survival on fungal infected food patches. Within-trait correlation between fungal infected and uninfected substrates was surprisingly weak, and developmental time was not correlated with body size. The results of this study demonstrate (a) the existence of genetic variation for larval developmental success in the presence of A. niger in a Drosophila population, and (b) heritability of important insect life history traits differed as a function of the larval environment (fungal infected or uninfected feeding substrate).

We present the first complete map of this type using as our model Folsomia candida exposed to five different concentrations of the widespread anthelmintic veterinary medicine ivermectin in replicated microcosm experiments lasting 49 days. The concentrations of ivermectin in yeast were 0.0, 6.8 28.83 66.4 and 210.0 mg/L wet weight. Increasing density and chemical concentration both significantly reduced the population growth rate of Folsomia candida, in part through effects on food consumption and fecundity. The interaction between density and ivermectin concentration was ""less-than-additive,"" implying that at high density populations were able to compensate for the effects of the chemical.

The experiment was conducted in large containers (mesocosms) subjected to 1 of the following UVBR regimes: excluded UVBR (WUVB), natural UVBR (NUVB), and natural UVBR enhanced with either 2 lamps (LUVB) or 3 lamps (HUVB). incubations with fluorescently labeled bacteria were conducted daily as a tool to understand the interaction between the potential bacterivores (heterotrophic ciliates and nanoflagellates) and bacteria within the studied system. UVBR intensities had no significant effects on the estimated clearance and ingestion rates (CR and IR, respectively) until Day 5 of the experiment. During the following 2 d, characterized by low nutrient concentration, both CR and IR decreased with the increase of the daily UVBR (at 305 and 320 nm) doses received. The maximum difference between treatments was observed on Day 7, where both clearance and ingestion rate values in the NUVB, LUVB and HUVB treatments were significantly lower than the WUVB treatment. Our data suggest that over a 1 d period and under conditions of high nutrient concentrations, protozoan bacterivory is not affected by UVBR increases. When nutrient concentrations become low, bacterivores become more susceptible to damaging UVBR effects. We think that the deterioration of food quality, itself resulting from the synergistic action of nutrients and UVBR stresses, is responsible for the increased sensitivity of bacterivores to UVBR.

However, climate is anticipated to surpass land use as a factor later in the next century, particularly in the Arctic. Discussed here are the implications of land use and climate change on the Yamal Peninsula of north-west Siberia, homeland of the Yamal Nenets. Since the discovery of super-giant natural gas fields in the 1960s, extensive exploration has resulted in the direct withdrawal of large areas for infrastructure development and associated disturbance regimes have led to cumulative impacts on thousands of additional hectares of land. The land withdrawals have pushed a relatively consistent or increasing number of reindeer onto progressively smaller parcels of pasture. This has led to excessive grazing and trampling of lichens, bryophytes and shrubs and, in many areas, erosion of sandy soils via deflation. The low Arctic tundra lies entirely within the continuous permafrost zone and ice-rich substrates are widespread. One implication of this is that both anthropogenic and zoogenic disturbance regimes may easily initiate thermokarst and aeolian erosion, leading to significant further losses of pastures. Even without industrial disturbance, a slight change of the climate would result in massive thermokarst erosion. This would have negative consequences equal to or greater than the mechanical disturbances described above. The synergistic effects of land use coupled with climate change therefore have profound implications for the ecosystems of Yamal, as well as the future of the Nenets culture, society and economy.",13,1999,18,2,367,373"Leathwick, JR; Rogers, GM","Modelling relationships between environment and canopy composition in secondary vegetation in central North Island, New Zealand",NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Article,"Relationships between composition of secondary vegetation and environment were studied in central North Island, New Zealand.

A recent meta-analysis showed that empirically measured phage-bacteria infection networks are often significantly nested, on average, and not modular. A perfectly nested network is one in which phages can be ordered from specialist to generalist such that the host range of a given phage is a subset of the host range of the subsequent phage in the ordering. The same meta-analysis hypothesized that modularity, in which groups of phages specialize on distinct groups of hosts, should emerge at larger geographic and/or taxonomic scales. In this paper, we evaluate the largest known phage-bacteria interaction data set, representing the interaction of 215 phage types with 286 host types sampled from geographically separated sites in the Atlantic Ocean. We find that this interaction network is highly modular. In addition, some of the modules identified in this data set are nested or contain submodules, indicating the presence of multi-scale structure, as hypothesized in the earlier meta-analysis.

Firstly, rain-fed agriculture is becoming less dominant; future abandonment of rain-fed agriculture should be anticipated. Secondly, expansion of forested areas is evident in higher altitudes. The trend is still likely to continue given the possibility of further abandonment of rain-fed farming and existing subsidies for reforestation of arable land. Thirdly, intensification has been observed which has occurred mainly in lower parts of the landscape on flat to gentle slopes and near main roads. Further intensification is likely to be subject to market drivers, irrigation water availability, and future rural development and agricultural policy. Overall, the study shows that even within a given locality, contrasting land use trajectories can emerge as a result of local responses to multiple drivers of change and these need to be carefully taken into account in future policy development.

While global environmental change is transforming the ecology of tropical forests, a number of studies have also demonstrated that tropical forests are able to recover following disturbance. But are tropical forests resilient to environmental and anthropogenic disturbances over timescales of centuries or millennia? Here we examine the relationship between vegetation cover and variation in monsoon rainfall, soil erosion, and fire over 7500 years in an ancient tropical landscape in the Western Ghats of India. We collected two overlapping sediment sequences at one study site and analysed them with palaeoecological techniques to reconstruct vegetation cover. Results suggest that climate and land-use changes might have had synergistic effects on this forested landscape, although the relationship between these factors and vegetation cover has varied over time. Results also indicate that the weakening of monsoon around 5750 BP might have caused a threshold event altering this landscape to a low tree-cover state. Although anthropogenic fire has maintained this landscape in low tree cover state from 3500 BP, this degraded tree-grassland mosaic has remained relatively resilient to fluctuations in environmental and anthropogenic factors. Tree taxa present throughout the sequence have lighter seeds than those absent in parts of the sequence, suggesting that dispersal mode might be an important factor in their persistence. Despite maintaining a degraded and fragmented forest mosaic, however, this landscape has supported populations of heavy-seeded trees and a probable refuge to their dispersal agents. We suggest that retaining tree cover on this landscape, even if fragmented, is key to maintaining its ecological resilience to environmental and anthropogenic disturbance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Thermoregulation and pathogen resistance are two energetically demanding processes that co-occur during seasonal epidemics for many endothermic vertebrates. The ability of hosts to cope with these processes simultaneously may influence population-level disease dynamics. 2. In North American house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus), outbreaks of the bacterium Mycoplasma gallisepticum occur during fall and winter, when ambient temperatures across the hosts range are often below thermoneutrality. Here, we examined how ambient temperature influences host energetics and susceptibility to this naturally occurring seasonal pathogen by experimentally infecting wild-caught house finches with M. gallisepticum at either thermoneutral or subthermoneutral temperatures in the laboratory. We quantified the metabolic costs of infection, measures of body condition, two components of the acute-phase response, disease expression and pathogen loads under both temperature regimes. 3. The metabolic costs of simultaneous infection with M. gallisepticum and thermoregulation were additive and significant (combined costs of 4.71 kJ per night; within the range of the daily energy requirements of passerine moult). Contrary to our predictions, house finches at subthermoneutral temperatures had lower disease expression and higher circulating levels of the cytokine interleukin-6 in response to experimental infection with M. gallisepticum than finches at thermoneutral. However, pathogen loads did not differ between the two temperature treatments. Finches from both treatments expressed fever in response to infection, but the magnitude of fever did not vary with ambient temperature. 4. Despite the significant energy costs of infection and thermoregulation, house finches from both temperature treatments maintained body mass and pectoral muscle condition, suggesting that birds housed at subthermoneutral consumed more food to maintain energy balance. In the field, competition for finite resources would be expected to exacerbate the effects found here and force infected birds to spend more time at feeders where M. gallisepticum is transmitted. 5. Overall, our results indicate that moderate cold stress alters house finch immunity, energetics and disease pathology, but does not alter infectiousness as measured by pathogen load. The effects of ambient temperature on host response and energy demands could directly or indirectly contribute to seasonal and geographical variation in disease dynamics in free-living house finches. More broadly, our results suggest that even subtle changes in abiotic factors such as temperature can alter host disease expression, with broad implications for disease dynamics.",12,2012,26,3,701,710"Larsen, TH",Upslope Range Shifts of Andean Dung Beetles in Response to Deforestation: Compounding and Confounding Effects of Microclimatic Change,BIOTROPICA,Article,"Warmer, and sometimes drier, conditions associated with global climate change are driving many species to shift poleward and/or upslope. I hypothesized that microclimatic changes related to deforestation cause similar shifts for forest species persisting within degraded landscapes. This appears to be the first study to examine this novel hypothesis. I examined elevational distributions of dung beetle communities along parallel intact and disturbed elevational gradients from 290 to 3450 m asl in the Andes of southeastern Peru. Deforested sites were consistently warmer and drier than forested sites. To maintain the same ambient temperature as in forest, species in a deforested landscape would need to shift on average 489 +/- 59 m upslope. Dung beetle species showed a mean upslope range shift of 132 +/- 64 m (maximum=743 m) in the deforested landscape. Eight species occurred farther upslope in the degraded landscape, while none shifted downslope. In addition to upper range limit expansions, six species shifting upslope also showed range contractions or population declines at their lower range boundary. High elevation and disturbance-tolerant species did not show range shifts. These findings suggest that land-use change may both confound and compound the influence of global climate change on biodiversity. Synergies between habitat degradation and climate change could more than double previous range shift projections for this century, leading to unexpectedly rapid changes in biodiversity, especially for sensitive organisms such as tropical insects. On the other hand, range shifts caused by habitat degradation may be mistakenly attributed to global climate change.",12,2012,44,1,82,89"Muller, R; Seeland, A; Jagodzinski, LS; Diogo, JB; Nowak, C; Oehlmann, J",Simulated climate change conditions unveil the toxic potential of the fungicide pyrimethanil on the midge Chironomus riparius: a multigeneration experiment,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Article,"Although it has been suggested that temperature increase may alter the toxic potential of environmental pollutants, few studies have investigated the potential risk of chemical stressors for wildlife under Global Climate Change (GCC) impact. We applied a bifactorial multigeneration study in order to test if GCC conditions alter the effects of low pesticide concentrations on life history and genetic diversity of the aquatic model organism Chironomus riparius. Experimental populations of the species were chronically exposed to a low concentration of the fungicide pyrimethanil (half of the no-observed-adverse-effect concentration: NOAEC/2) under two dynamic present-day temperature simulations (11.0-22.7 degrees C; 14.0-25.2 degrees C) and one future scenario (16.5-28.1 degrees C). During the 140-day multigeneration study, survival, emergence, reproduction, population growth, and genetic diversity of C. riparius were analyzed. Our results reveal that high temperature and pyrimethanil act synergistically on the midge C. riparius. In simulated present-day scenarios, a NOAEC/2 of pyrimethanil as derived from a life-cycle toxicity test provoked only slight-to-moderate beneficial or adverse effects on C. riparius. In contrast, exposure to a NOAEC/2 concentration of pyrimethanil at a thermal situation likely for a summer under GCC conditions uncovered adverse effects on mortality and population growth rate. In addition, genetic diversity was considerably reduced by pyrimethanil in the future scenario, but only slightly under current climatic conditions. Our multigeneration study under near-natural (climatic) conditions indicates that not only the impact of climate change, but also low concentrations of pesticides may pose a reasonable risk for aquatic insects in future.",12,2012,2,1,196,210"Coutellec, MA; Caquet, T",Heterosis and inbreeding depression in bottlenecked populations: a test in the hermaphroditic freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis,JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,Article,"Small population size is expected to induce heterosis, due to the random fixation and accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations, whereas within-population inbreeding depression should decrease due to increased homozygosity. Population bottlenecks, although less effective, may have similar consequences. We tested this hypothesis in the self-fertile freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis, by subjecting experimental populations to a single bottleneck of varied magnitude. Although patterns were not strong, heterosis was significant in the most severely bottlenecked populations, under stressful conditions. This was mainly due to hatching rate, suggesting that early acting and highly deleterious alleles were involved. Although L. stagnalis is a preferential outcrosser, inbreeding depression was very low and showed no clear relationship with bottleneck size. In the less reduced populations, inbreeding depression for hatching success increased under high inbreeding. This may be consistent with the occurence of synergistic epistasis between fitness loci, which may contribute to favour outcrossing in L. stagnalis.",12,2011,24,10,2248,2257"Kiesecker, JM",Global stressors and the global decline of amphibians: tipping the stress immunocompetency axis,ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH,Article,"There is a widespread consensus that the earth is experiencing a mass extinction event and at the forefront are amphibians, the most threatened of all vertebrate taxa. A recent assessment found that nearly one-third (32%, 1,856 species) of the world's amphibian species are threatened. Amphibians have existed on the earth for over 300 million years, yet in just the last two decades there have been an alarming number of extinctions, nearly 168 species are believed to have gone extinct and at least 2,469 (43%) more have populations that are declining. Infectious diseases have been recognized as one major cause of worldwide amphibian population declines. This could be the result of the appearance of novel pathogens, or it could be that exposure to environmental stressors is increasing the susceptibility of amphibians to opportunistic pathogens. Here I review the potential effects of stressors on disease susceptibility in amphibians and relate this to disease emergence in human and other wildlife populations. I will present a series of case studies that illustrate the role of stress in disease outbreaks that have resulted in amphibian declines. First, I will examine how elevated sea-surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific since the mid-1970s have affected climate over much of the world and could be setting the stage for pathogen-mediated amphibian declines in many regions. Finally, I will discuss how the apparently rapid increase in the prevalence of amphibian limb deformities is linked to the synergistic effects of trematode infection and exposure to chemical contaminants.",12,2011,26,5,897,908"Torres, A; Palacin, C; Seoane, J; Alonso, JC",Assessing the effects of a highway on a threatened species using Before-During-After and Before-During-After-Control-Impact designs,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,Article,"Due to the growing awareness of potential impacts of roads, managers demand well-designed studies about the implications of linear infrastructures on ecosystems. We illustrate the application of Before-During-After and Before-During-After-Control-Impact designs (BOA and BDACI) to assess effects of highway construction and operation using a population of great bustards (Otis tarda) as a model. Based on a time series of demographic and distribution data (1997-2009), we developed generalized additive models and classification trees to test the effect of road distance on bustard distribution, identify road-effect distances and explore the seasonality of these effects. Two control zones were selected to test the changes between construction phases on productivity, and population trends using TRIM models. From the start of the road construction, great bustards tended to avoid close proximity to the highway (ca. 560-750 m threshold distance). The exclusion band was narrower during the breeding season. In addition, family groups were less tolerant to highway operation disturbances, as shown by their higher distance effect (ca. 1300 m). Population trends did not differ between impact and control zones during the construction. However, once the highway was in operation, bustard numbers declined gradually up to 50% in the impact zone, remained stable in the closest control zone, and increased in the zone located at the greatest distance from the highway. The effects on density of family groups were less evident. Our approach provides information relevant to great bustard conservation and suggests methods for obtaining information of interest to road managers, that could be applied to linear infrastructures with others species.

Inadequate livestock management, including keeping sheep numbers above carrying capacity, has led to a degradation of the Patagonian steppe. Recently, interest has grown towards a reduction in sheep density and diversification of extractive activities. Guanaco populations could be potentially amenable to a number of sustainable uses. Our aim was to investigate the factors that determine guanaco distribution in southern Argentine Patagonia and to generate a predictive cartography at the regional scale. We hypothesized that guanaco distribution could be determined by primary productivity, terrain ruggedness, human disturbance and poaching, and competition with livestock. Guanaco surveys were performed from vehicles using a road survey method. To analyze the relationship between guanaco occurrence and potential predictors we built Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) using a binomial error and a logistic link. We found that guanaco occurrence increased in the less productive and remote areas, far from cities and oil camps, and decreased in regions with high sheep density. These results suggest that guanacos tend to occur where human pressure is lower. One way to promote guanaco conservation would be to highlight the economic value of guanacos under the regulations imposed by a sustainable exploitation of their populations.

Yet the role of disturbance in plant invasions may be less predictable than often assumed, due to the influence of environmental stochasticity and interactions between disturbance regimes. We evaluated the single and interactive effects of prescribed burning (large-scale, infrequent event) and animal diggings (small-scale, frequent events) on the invasion success of Gleditsia triacanthos L. in a tussock grassland relict of the Inland Pampa, Argentina. Tree seedling emergence and survival were monitored over 4 years, after adjusting for propagule pressure through copious seed addition to all disturbance treatments. Burning altered community structure by suppressing tussock grasses and promoting exotic forbs, whereas simulated, armadillo-like diggings had little impact on herbaceous composition. Overall, seedling emergence rather than survival represented the main demographic bottleneck for tree invasion. Tree establishment success varied among seedling cohorts emerged in different climatic years. In a dry year, emergence was only slightly affected by disturbances. In contrast, for two consecutive wet years, initial burning and armadillo-like diggings exerted strong, antagonistic effects on tree recruitment. Whereas fire alone increased recruitment, the simulated burrowing regime prevented seedling emergence in both burned and unburned plots. The latter effect might be explained by reduced soil moisture, and increased seed burial and predation in excavated patches. Thus, the impact of a single, large-scale perturbation promoting woody plant invasion was overridden by a regime of small-scale, frequent disturbances. Our results show that grassland invasibility was contingent on inter-annual climatic variation as well as unexpected interactions between natural and anthropogenic disturbance agents.",12,2010,12,9,3109,3122"Kotowski, W; Beauchard, O; Opdekamp, W; Meire, P; van Diggelen, R",Waterlogging and canopy interact to control species recruitment in floodplains,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,Article,"P>1. The extent to which seedling recruitment contributes to local functional diversity depends on the environmental filters operating in a plant community. Classical community assembly models assume that habitat constraints and competition act like hierarchical filters with habitat filtering as the dominant one. Alternative models assume a synergic interaction since responses to environmental stress and competition may impose physiological trade-offs in plants. 2. River floodplains are an ideal system to test the relationship between habitat and competition filtering in community (re)assembly, as flooding causes changes in both habitat stress (waterlogging, resulting in anoxia and toxicity) and competition (dieback of vegetation) on one hand and acts as an effective seed dispersal vector on the other hand. 3. We conducted a mesocosm experiment on early community assembly from a pool of 34 floodplain species covering a wetness gradient. Seed mixtures were sown in a full factorial design with water level, canopy and mowing as controlling factors. We measured the biomass of all species after one growing season and determined germination and seedling growth traits, both outside (response to waterlogging/no waterlogging) and in a growth-chamber (response to light/darkness). 4. Species recruitment was analysed in relation to the controlling factors and measured functional traits using co-inertia analysis. Furthermore we analysed the effects of the controlling factors on several aspects of functional diversity. 5. There was no establishment in grass sward, unless mowing was applied. Species-rich communities only developed when germination and early establishment phases occurred on waterlogged bare soil. High water level did not suppress establishment but reduced the total biomass and lowered inter-specific competition. The effect of mowing on species richness depended upon the interplay between waterlogging and canopy. 6. Establishment success under canopy required seedling strategies to tolerate shade. The elimination of typical wetland specialists from oxic mesocosms was clearly an effect of their poorer and/or slower germination and lower competitive abilities in comparison to non-wetland plants, leading to their disappearance in this low-stress environment. 7. Our results indicate that single stress factors can enhance species richness and functional diversity through limiting competition but a synergic interaction of different stresses can lead to reduced richness.",12,2010,24,4,918,926"Westley, PAH; Schindler, DE; Quinn, TP; Ruggerone, GT; Hilborn, R","Natural habitat change, commercial fishing, climate, and dispersal interact to restructure an Alaskan fish metacommunity",OECOLOGIA,Article,"The metacommunity concept has recently been described to account for the roles of dispersal in regulating community structure. Despite its strong theoretical basis, there exist few large-scale and long-term examples of its applicability in aquatic ecosystems. In this study we used a long-term dataset (1961-2007) on the relative abundances of the dominant limnetic fishes from two interconnected lakes to investigate the synergistic effects of naturally declining lake volume (approximately 50% in 50 years), climate variation, fishery management, and dispersal on community composition. We found a marked shift in fish community composition and variability during a period of rapid natural habitat change; however, the change was most apparent in the downstream, more stable lake of the system rather than at the site of disturbance. Multivariate analysis suggested significant shifts in community composition and variability in the downstream lake. Results indicated that the community composition in both lakes was best explained by habitat loss in the upper watershed and the number of spawning adult sockeye salmon the previous year (reflecting both natural processes and commercial fishing). Furthermore, communities exhibited site-specific responses to climatic conditions (e.g., index of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation), whereby the upper lake responded to climate within a given year and with a 1-year time lag, whereas the downstream community responded only with a 1-year lag. We attribute this difference largely to downstream dispersal and recruitment of fish from the upper lake. Thus, we suggest that the interconnected nature of the communities in this system provides a useful and large-scale example of the metacommunity concept, whereby the effects of environmental disturbance on community structure ultimately depend on the effects of these disturbances on dispersal among ecosystems.",12,2010,163,2,471,484"Ahmed, MZ; Khan, MA","Tolerance and recovery responses of playa halophytes to light, salinity and temperature stresses during seed germination",FLORA,Article,"Halogeton glomeratus (M.

Seeds were germinated under various salinity (0-500 mM NaCl), light (12 h-light: 12 h-dark and 24 h-dark) and temperature (5/15, 10/20, 15/25, 20/30, and 25/35 degrees C, dark/light) regimes for 20 days to determine the optimal conditions for germination and recovery of seeds from these factors when exposed to less than optimal conditions. Seeds that failed to germinate in dark were transferred successively to 12 h-photoperiod, salinity to distilled water and from various temperature regimes to 20/30 degrees C. to determine the effect of these stresses and the ability of these seeds to recover respectively. Highest seed germination (H. glomeratus and L latifolium: 100%; P. harmala: 80%) was obtained in non-saline control at 20/30 degrees C in 12 h-photoperiod, however, increase in salinity progressively inhibited seed germination. Seed germination of H. glomeratus and P. harmala was substantially inhibited and that of L. latifolium was prevented in dark. Salinity and dark treatments have a synergistic effect in inhibiting seed germination of all species. No seed of any species germinated at 5/15 degrees C; germination was substantially inhibited at 25/35 degrees C both for H. glomeratus and P. harmala while L latifolium failed to germinate at 25/35 degrees C. Rate of germination also decreased with an increase in salinity at all temperature regimes but this effect was minimal at optimal temperature regime of 20/30 degrees C. After successive elimination of light, salinity and temperature stresses, final seed germination was identical to respective controls. The results indicate that seeds of these temperate halophytes could endure environmental stresses without losing viability and germinate readily when these stresses are removed. Under the extremely variable conditions of the playa habitat these species are highly opportunistic exploiting the windows of opportunity available during spring or early summer.

Grazing-induced heterogeneity is often evoked as an explanation for this influence. However, the relative importance of plant community heterogeneity induced by herbivores compared to other mechanisms linked to grazing remains unclear. We investigated this question by looking at 3 plant communities found in wet grasslands situated along the French Atlantic coast and traditionally grazed by horses and cattle. An experimental design set up in 1995 allowed us to compare the consequences of cattle-grazing, horse-grazing, and grazing abandonment on plant community diversity and heterogeneity. Floristic measurements made in 2007 showed that cattle and horses both had a positive impact on species richness and Shannon diversity index and that patchiness only occurred in grazed situations. The relative importance of grazing-induced patchiness within the overall positive effect of grazing on plant diversity was assessed by partitioning the diversity gain due to grazing into its additive within-and among-patch components. Grazing-induced patchiness entirely explained the increase in plant richness, whereas it accounted for only a small part of Shannon diversity. Grazing-related processes operating at the patch scale explained the main part of the increase in Shannon diversity.

Such stress may be reflected in demographical or morphological changes in the individuals inhabiting those landscapes. This Study evaluates the effects of fragmentation of the Maulino forest on population density, sex ratio, body size, and fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of the endemic carabid Ceroglossus chilensis. Individuals of C chilensis were collected during 2006 in five locations at Los Queules National Reserve (continuous forest), in five forest fragments and in five areas of surrounding pine plantations (matrix). In each location, once a season, 40 pitfall traps (20 in the centre, 20 in the edge), were opened for 72 h. Population density of C. chilensis was higher in the small fragments than in the pine matrix, with intermediate densities in the continuous forest; sex ratio did not differ significantly from 1: 1 in the three habitats. Individuals from the centre of fragments were smaller than those from the centre of continuous forest, and FA did not vary significantly among habitats. These results suggest that small forest fragments maintain dense populations of C chilensis and therefore they must be considered in conservation strategies. Although the decrease of the body size suggests that small remnants should be connected by managing the structure of the surrounding matrix, facilitating the dispersion of this carabid across the landscape and avoiding possible antagonistic interactions inside small fragments.

The spatial configuration of sites allowed us to test if the effects of a cyclone and those from fragmentation interact.

Beetle species composition was significantly different pre-and post-cyclone although the magnitude of faunal change was not large with 205 species, representing 96% of all individuals, present in both sampling events. Sites with the greatest changes to structure had the greatest changes in species composition. At the site level, increases in woody debris and wood-feeding beetle (Scolytinae) counts were significantly correlated but changes in the percent of ground vegetation were not mirrored by changes in the abundance of foliage-feeding beetles (Chrysomelidae). The overall direction of beetle assemblage change was consistent with increasing aridity, presumably caused by the loss of canopy cover. Sites with the greatest canopy loss had the strongest changes in the proportion of species previously identified in the pre-cyclone study as preferring arid or moist rainforest environments.

We experimentally investigated parasite-mediated coexistence of two genotypes of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens, where one genotype underwent coevolution with a parasite (a virulent bacteriophage), whereas the other genotype was resistant to the evolving phages at all time points, but a poorer competitor. In the absence of phages, the resistant genotype was rapidly driven extinct in all populations. In the presence of the phages, the resistant genotype persisted in four of six populations and eventually reached higher frequencies than the sensitive genotype. The coevolving genotype showed a reduction in the growth rate, consistent with a cost of resistance, which may be responsible for a decline in its relative fitness.

Research in this area has, however, been largely restricted to considerations of how detrital species mixing affects litter decay processes. The consequences of changing detrital resources for whole assemblages of sediment-dwelling invertebrates remain largely unknown. We manipulated the availability of three detrital sources, Avicennia marina leaves, Posidonia australis blades and Sargassum sp. thalli, on an Australian mudflat to test hypotheses about how changes in the type and number of macrophytes contributing to detrital resources might impact benthic invertebrate assemblages of estuarine soft-sediments. By controlling for changes in total detrital biomass and ensuring that each detrital source was present in two- and three-species mixes as well as monocultures, our experimental design was able to distinguish among effects of mixing, identity and biomass. Three months after detrital manipulation, macroinvertebrate abundance and species richness differed among treatments according to the biomass of detritus added and non-additive effects of detrital species mixing. Whereas the mixing of two detrital species generally had an antagonistic effect on macroinvertebrate abundance and richness, faunal assemblages did not appreciably differ between three-species mixes and monocultures. Generally negative effects of two-species mixes on macroinvertebrates were opposed by positive effects on microphytobenthos, an important food-source for many of the animals. Non-additive effects on sediment communities were particularly apparent when Sargassum sp., the most labile of the three detrital sources considered, was included in two-species mixes.

We reared larvae of the damselfly Coenagrion puella under the threat of predators and cannibals. We then examined sex-specific patterns in two life-history traits as well as two immune traits and tested for independency of the plastic responses among life-history and immune traits. Results revealed immune traits to be partly decoupled from life-history traits. Moreover, the sexes differed in the plasticity of life-history as well as immune traits. Our results give strong evidence that sex-specific translation of larval condition into adult fitness may be linked to immune traits as well as age and size at transition.",12,2008,22,1,114,120"Wayne, AF; Cowling, A; Lindenmayer, DB; Ward, CG; Vellios, CV; Donnelly, CF; Calvey, MC",The abundance of a threatened arboreal marsupial in relation to anthropogenic disturbances at local and landscape scales in Mediterranean-type forests in south-western Australia,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,Review,"This study investigated associations between the relative abundance of the threatened ngwayir (western ringtail possum, Pseudocheirus occidentalis) and anthropogenic disturbances at local and landscape scales within the publicly-managed jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forests of south-western Australia. Logging, fire, fox (Vulpes vulpes) control and forest fragmentation were investigated in relation to the relative abundance of ngwayir at 90 sites within an area of 285,000 ha east of Manjimup; the location of the last remaining substantial population of ngwayir in jarrah forest. Overall, ngwayir abundance was greatest in areas with limited anthropogenic disturbance. At the local-scale, ngwayir abundance was negatively associated with greater fire intensity. At the landscape-scale, it was positively associated with fox control and negatively associated with forest fragmentation and distance from non-remnant vegetation (i.e., agriculture and tree plantations). Abundance was also greatest in predominantly unlogged landscapes and in forests that had been regrowing for an average of 40 years since the landscape was most recently logged, in other words, where logging was historically least intense. Interactions between fox control efforts and forest fragmentation were also important. This study emphasises the importance of conducting research at appropriate spatial scales and to account for the synergistic effects of the causes of decline. An adaptive management approach to the mitigation of the agents of decline is recommended. Indirect evidence indicates that high value habitat for ngwayir has in all likelihood been selectively cleared for agriculture, owing to its fertile and productive nature. Habitat loss is, therefore, also likely to be a major cause of the modern decline of the species. While many jarrah forest areas that support remaining high abundances of the ngwayir have been incorporated into reserves, conservation of ngwayir habitat and populations outside reserves also will be essential for the recovery and long-term viability of the species.

This is relevant particularly for islands with high degrees of endemism. In the present paper the role of fragmentation and possible effects of introduced Rattus rattus on endemic rodents (Macrotarsomys bastardi and Eliurus spp.) and the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) were assessed for dry deciduous forests in Madagascar. Capture rates of endemic rodents declined significantly with declining fragment size. Macrotarsomys bastardi was never caught in primary forest fragments < 600 ha or outside the primary forest but captures of M. bastardi were correlated to changes in vegetation structure associated with fragmentation rather than to fragment size per se. Eliurus spp. were also found in small primary-forest fragments and in secondary forests close to primary forests, suggesting that secondary forests can serve as buffer zones or corridors for this species. The lemur M. murinus was caught in all types of primary and secondary forest. This species did not seem to respond to fragmentation of primary forests. Even though it was found in most secondary-forests, capture rates declined as these secondary forest formations increased in size. This indicates that secondary forests are suboptimal habitats for M. murinus. Rattus rattus were caught in all vegetation formations except for the open savanna. Their capture rates increased as forest fragments became smaller, indicating that mosaics of different habitat types are beneficial for introduced rats. There was no significant relation between capture rates of R. rattus and the endemic species. In conclusion, these results suggest that (1) native Malagasy rodents of the dry deciduous forest are more sensitive towards forest disturbance than M. murinus: (2) there is no indication for negative interactions between introduced rats and the native small-mammal fauna.",12,2003,6,,147,157"Fuller, RC; Houle, D",Detecting genetic variation in developmental instability by artificial selection on fluctuating asymmetry,JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,Article,"Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is frequently used as a measure of developmental instability (DI). Assuming a genetic basis to DI, many have argued that FA may be a good indicator of genetic quality to potential mates and to human managers of populations. Unfortunately FA is a poor indicator of DI, making it very difficult to verify this assertion. A recent review of the literature suggests that previous studies of the inheritance of FA and DI using half-sib covariances and parent-offspring regression have been unable to put meaningful limits on the heritability of FA and DI because of the extremely low power of the experiments performed. In this study, we consider the power of artificial selection on FA as an alternative approach to studying the inheritance of FA and DI. Using simulations, we investigate the efficacy of selection for both increased and decreased FA for detecting genetic variation. We find that selection for increased FA has much more power to detect the presence of genetic variation than does selection for decreased FA. These results hold when realistic sample sizes are employed. Artificial selection for increased FA is currently the most powerful approach for the detection of genetic variation in DI.",12,2002,15,6,954,960"Hansen, LJ; Whitehead, JA; Anderson, SL",Solar UV radiation enhances the toxicity of arsenic in Ceriodaphnia dubia,ECOTOXICOLOGY,Article,"Extensive research exists regarding the toxicity of metals (including arsenic) to aquatic invertebrates. However, there has been little consideration of potential synergies between metals and ultraviolet (UV) radiation-despite considerable debate on this topic in human health research. Ultraviolet radiation is nearly ubiquitous in the natural environment, but it is generally overlooked as a confounding variable in toxicological assessments. We evaluate synergies between arsenic and solar UV radiation using the crustacean, Ceriodaphnia dubia. Both laboratory (with simulated solar radiation) and outdoor (with natural solar radiation) factorial experiments were performed with two intensities of UV (low and high) and four arsenic concentrations (0, 1, 1.25 and 1.5mg/l). The laboratory experiment was multigenerational, examining survival and fecundity effects. The combination of high UV+1.5mg/l As adversely impacted survival; whereas, High UV+0mg/l As and Low UV+1.5mg/l As treatments did not. These results suggest synergism. This pattern was consistent for all three generations. Fecundity effects were not consistent across generations, and arsenic was demonstrated to have a greater impact than UV. Outdoor experiments were limited to assessing survival. Exposures in September 1999 resulted in a pattern similar to that in the laboratory exposure. High UV+1.5mg/l As treatment elicited diminished survival as compared to high UV+0mg/l As and low UV+1.5mg/l As. These results indicate that a synergistic effect between arsenic and UV exposure is possible under ambient conditions and within a relatively narrow dose range. The mechanism of this effect is unknown but could include synergistic genotoxic or oxidative stress. These findings point to the importance of using realistic UV exposures when determining criteria for protection of aquatic life.",12,2002,11,4,279,287"Benchimol, M; Peres, CA",Anthropogenic modulators of species-area relationships in Neotropical primates: a continental-scale analysis of fragmented forest landscapes,DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,Review,"AimWe conducted the first comprehensive quantitative review on the effects of habitat fragmentation on Neotropical primates to examine how both patch disturbance and landscape variables modulate species-area relationships (SARs) and species persistence in fragmented forest landscapes. LocationNeotropical forests, from Mexico to Argentina. MethodsWe use species occupancy data from 705 forest fragments and 55 adjacent continuous forests nested within 61 landscapes, which we compiled from 96 studies reporting data on patch-scale species composition and patch size/location. Presence-absence data on 19 species functional groups and an index of hunting pressure and matrix type were assigned to each forest patch. We adopted a multilevel analysis, examining SARs and patterns of species retention coupled with the additive effects of hunting pressure and landscape connectivity both across all forest patches and 728 sites nested within 38 landscapes containing four or more sites. ResultsWe uncovered a consistent effect of patch area in explaining primate species richness. Over and above area effects, however, SARs were strongly modulated by levels of hunting pressure at the landscape scale in predicting species occurrence and aggregate assemblage biomass. Matrix type was also a good predictor of both extant species richness and aggregate biomass when only non-hunted sites were considered, with patches in more permeable matrices containing more species. Main conclusionsAlthough the importance of patch area in predicting species persistence is undeniable, we found that SARs were clearly affected by within-patch human exploitation of increasingly isolated primate populations. Both expanding the number of forest reserves and enforcing protection within nominal protected areas are therefore required to ensure the long-term persistence of full primate assemblages. We highlight the importance of considering multiple anthropogenic effects in assessing the synergistic effects of land use to explain patterns of species persistence in fragmented tropical forest landscapes.",11,2013,19,11,1339,1352"Vos, VCA; van Ruijven, J; Berg, MP; Peeters, ETHM; Berendse, F",Leaf litter quality drives litter mixing effects through complementary resource use among detritivores,OECOLOGIA,Article,"To comprehend the potential consequences of biodiversity loss on the leaf litter decomposition process, a better understanding of its underlying mechanisms is necessary. Here, we hypothesize that positive litter mixture effects occur via complementary resource use, when litter species complement each other in terms of resource quality for detritivores. To investigate this, monocultures and mixtures of two leaf litter species varying in quality were allowed to decompose with and without a single macro-detritivore species (the terrestrial woodlice Oniscus asellus). Resource quality of the mixture was assessed by the mean concentration, the dissimilarity in absolute and relative concentrations, and the covariance between nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and calcium (Ca) supply. Our results clearly show that litter mixing effects were driven by differences in their resource quality for detritivores. In particular, complementary supply of N and P was a major driver of litter mixing effects. Interestingly, litter mixing effects caused by the addition of woodlice were predominantly driven by N dissimilarity, whereas in their absence, increased P concentration was the main driver of litter mixing effects. These results show that ultimately, litter diversity effects on decomposition may be driven by complementary resource use of the whole decomposer community (i.e., microbes and macro-detritivores).",11,2013,173,1,269,280"Rodrigo, MA; Rojo, C; Alonso-Guillen, JL; Vera, P",Restoration of two small Mediterranean lagoons: The dynamics of submerged macrophytes and factors that affect the success of revegetation,ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,Article,"Two small, shallow lagoons newly created from former rice fields in the Mediterranean coast (Albufera de Valencia Natural Park, Spain) were restored by planting several species of submerged macrophytes (Myriophyllum spicatum, Ceratophyllum demersum, Potamogeton spp., Zannichellia peltata and Ranunculus peltatus) in 2008. Charophytes also appeared spontaneously. M. spicatum was the species that dominated both lagoons and almost completely covered their surface. M. spicatum reached a high biomass and displayed a seasonal pattern, declining during the cold season and reappearing in the spring. No submerged vegetation was observed in the lagoons from 2011 onward. The major purpose of the present study was to elucidate the factors that caused the total disappearance and prevented the regeneration of submerged vegetation cover in both lagoons. Such factors may include negative biotic relationships such as those related to the presence of fish and crayfish, waterfowl grazing, phytoplankton and epiphytic development that causes shading and abiotic factors such as water nutrient concentration. Three different types (treatments) of 1-m(2). exclosures were set up and planted with macrophyte cultures that formed 3 different assemblages: Chara hispida alone, a mixture of C vulgaris, C baltica and Nitella hyalina and a mixture of higher plants (M. spicatum, C demersum and Potamogeton pectinatus). The ""Open"" type of exclosure permitted the entrance of fish, crayfish, and birds. The ""Lateral"" exclosure prevented the entry of fish. The ""Closed"" exclosure also prevented bird grazing. To determine the potential of the seed sediment bank to regenerate submerged vegetation, we investigated lagoon sediments (i) to quantify seeds and (ii) to examine seed germination. The results indicate that there is not a sufficiently large reservoir of phanerogam seeds in the lagoon sediments to recover vegetation by germination. The ""Closed"" exclosures allowed the growth of all species in spite of the intense development of periphyton on macrophyte tissues and filamentous algae, which reduced light availability by up to 45%. The ""Lateral"" exclosures had a lower development of macrophytes. In the ""Open"" exclosures, almost no macrophytes were detected 3 weeks after planting. Water chemistry (P and N content) did not limit the development of the tested macrophyte species but did appear to negatively affect charophytes in one of the lagoons. The deleterious effect of exotic fauna (particularly carps and crayfish) in combination with the high herbivory pressure by waterfowl, primarily during the periods when the rice fields surrounding the lagoons were dry, were the major factors that acted in a negative synergistic manner to prevent the recolonisation of the vegetation currently in the lagoons. A procedure to eradicate exotic fish and crayfish is required prior to any type of restoration effort involving the plantation of submerged macrophytes. More areas with permanent submerged vegetation in the Natural Park are required to decrease herbivory pressure. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We have limited understanding of the relative influence of carnivores, harvest, weather and forage availability on elk Cervus elaphus demography, despite the ecological and economic importance of this species. We assessed adult female survival, a key vital rate for population dynamics, from 2746 radio-collared elk in 45 populations across western North America that experience wide variation in carnivore assemblage, harvest, weather and habitat conditions. Proportional hazard analysis revealed that baseline' (i.e. not related to human factors) mortality was higher with very high winter precipitation, particularly in populations sympatric with wolves Canis lupus. Mortality may increase via nutritional stress and heightened vulnerability to predation in snowy winters. Baseline mortality was unrelated to puma Puma concolor presence, forest cover or summer forage productivity. Cause-specific mortality analyses showed that wolves and all carnivore species combined had additive effects on baseline elk mortality, but only reduced survival by <2%. When human factors were included, total' adult mortality was solely related to harvest; the influence of native carnivores was compensatory. Annual total mortality rates were lowest in populations sympatric with both pumas and wolves because managers reduced female harvest in areas with abundant or diverse carnivores. Mortality from native carnivores peaked in late winter and early spring, while harvest-induced mortality peaked in autumn. The strong peak in harvest-induced mortality during the autumn hunting season decreased as the number of native carnivore species increased. Synthesis and applications. Elevated baseline adult female elk mortality from wolves in years with high winter precipitation could affect elk abundance as winters across the western US become drier and wolves recolonize portions of the region. In the absence of human harvest, wolves had additive, although limited, effects on mortality. However, human harvest, and its apparent use by managers to offset predation, primarily controls overall variation in adult female mortality. Altering harvest quotas is thus a strong tool for offsetting impacts of carnivore recolonization and shifting weather patterns on elk across western North America.",11,2013,50,2,295,305"Larimer, AL; Bever, JD; Clay, K",Consequences of simultaneous interactions of fungal endophytes and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi with a shared host grass,OIKOS,Article,"Plants simultaneously associate with multiple microbial symbionts throughout their lifetimes. To address the question of whether the effects of simultaneous symbionts are contingent on the specific identities, we conducted a greenhouse experiment manipulating the presence and identities of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and fungal endophytes on the shared host grass Elymus hystrix. Each plant host was inoculated with one of two AMF species having varying effects on host growth, or a sterile soil control. Further, we used naturally occurring endophyte-infected (E+) and uninfected (E) individuals from two populations of the endophyte Epichloe elymi that varied in their interaction with E. hystrix. We then measured responses of plants, AMF, and fungal endophytes. Overall, we found that the combined effects of AMF and fungal endophytes on plant growth were additive, reflecting the mutualistic quality of each symbiont independently interacting with host plants. However, fungal endophyte infection differentially altered hyphal colonization of the two AMF species and the identity of the coinfecting AMF species affected fungal endophyte fitness traits. The results of this study demonstrate that the outcome of interspecific symbiotic interactions varies with partner identity such that the effects of simultaneous symbioses can not be generalized.",11,2012,121,12,2090,2096"Doropoulos, C; Ward, S; Marshell, A; Diaz-Pulido, G; Mumby, PJ",Interactions among chronic and acute impacts on coral recruits: the importance of size-escape thresholds,ECOLOGY,Article,"Newly settled recruits typically suffer high mortality from disturbances, but rapid growth reduces their mortality once size-escape thresholds are attained. Ocean acidification (OA) reduces the growth of recruiting benthic invertebrates, yet no direct effects on survivorship have been demonstrated. We tested whether the reduced growth of coral recruits caused by OA would increase their mortality by prolonging their vulnerability to an acute disturbance: fish herbivory on surrounding algal turf. After two months' growth in ambient or elevated CO2 levels, the linear extension and calcification of coral (Acropora millepora) recruits decreased as CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) increased. When recruits were subjected to incidental fish grazing, their mortality was inversely size dependent. However, we also found an additive effect of pCO(2) such that recruit mortality was higher under elevated pCO(2) irrespective of size. Compared to ambient conditions, coral recruits needed to double their size at the highest pCO(2) to escape incidental grazing mortality. This general trend was observed with three groups of predators (blenny, surgeonfish, and parrotfish), although the magnitude of the fish treatment varied among species. Our study demonstrates the importance of size-escape thresholds in early recruit survival and how OA can shift these thresholds, potentially intensifying population bottlenecks in benthic invertebrate recruitment.",11,2012,93,10,2131,2138"Suykerbuyk, W; Bouma, TJ; van der Heide, T; Faust, C; Govers, LL; Giesen, WBJT; de Jong, DJ; van Katwijk, MM",Suppressing antagonistic bioengineering feedbacks doubles restoration success,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,Article,"In a seagrass restoration project, we explored the potential for enhancing the restoration process by excluding antagonistic engineering interactions (i.e., biomechanical warfare) between two ecosystem engineers: the bioturbating lugworm Arenicola marina and the sediment-stabilizing seagrass Zostera noltii Hornem. Applying a shell layer underneath half of our seagrass transplants successfully reduced adult lugworm density by over 80% and reduced lugworm-induced microtopography (a proxy for lugworm disturbance) at the wave-sheltered site. At the wave-exposed site adult lugworm densities and microtopography were already lower than at the sheltered site but were further reduced in the shell-treated units. Excluding lugworms and their bioengineering effects corresponded well with a strongly enhanced seagrass growth at the wave-sheltered site, which was absent at the exposed site. Enhanced seagrass growth in the present study was fully assigned to the removal of lugworms' negative engineering effects and not to any (indirect) evolving effects such as an altered biogeochemistry or sediment-stabilizing effects by the shell layer. The context-dependency implies that seagrass establishment at the exposed site is not constrained by negative ecosystem-engineering interactions only, but also by overriding physical stresses causing poor growth conditions. Present findings underline that, in addition to recent emphasis on considering positive (facilitating) interactions in ecological theory and practice, it is equally important to consider negative engineering interactions between ecosystem-engineering species. Removal of such negative interactions between ecosystem-engineering species can give a head start to the target species at the initial establishment phase, when positive engineering feedbacks by the target species on itself are still lacking. Though our study was carried out in a marine environment with variable levels of wave disturbance, similar principles may be expected to apply to other ecosystems that are inhabited by ecosystem engineers.",11,2012,22,4,1224,1231"Alton, LA; White, CR; Wilson, RS; Franklin, CE",The energetic cost of exposure to UV radiation for tadpoles is greater when they live with predators,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,Article,"1. Global increases in ultraviolet-B radiation (UVBR) associated with stratospheric ozone depletion are thought to be contributing to the rapid disappearance of amphibian populations from pristine habitats around the world. Much research has been dedicated to understanding the effects of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) alone and in combination with other environmental stressors on the early life stages of amphibians. Little is known, however, of how UVR affects amphibian metabolism, or how amphibian metabolism may change in response to exposure to other stressors in addition to UVR. 2. Using a controlled laboratory experiment, we examined the independent and interactive effects of UVR and non-lethal predatory chemical cues (PCC) on the tissue and whole-animal metabolic rate (MR) and activity of striped marsh frog Limnodynastes peronii tadpoles. PCC signal risk of predation, which is a natural stressor that can cause tadpoles to alter their behaviour, morphology, and life history, and for which the metabolic cost remains little explored. 3. We found that exposure to UVR caused tissue MR to increase by 36%, but whole-animal MR to decrease by 14%, which is most likely due to tadpoles reducing their activity levels by 56%. Exposure to PCC had no significant effect on tissue or whole-animal MR, but caused tadpoles to reduce their activity levels by 36%, indicating that the whole-animal MR of tadpoles exposed to PCC is elevated relative to their activity levels. Compared with tadpoles exposed to neither stressor, tadpoles exposed simultaneously to UVR and PCC showed no change in whole-animal MR despite reducing their activity levels by 62%. 4. This research shows that, for tadpoles, there is an energetic cost associated with being exposed to UVR and PCC independently, and that this cost is greater when they are exposed to both stressors simultaneously. Our previous research has shown that exposure of tadpoles to PCC enhances the lethal effects of UVR, and the present study suggests that this synergistic interaction may arise as a consequence of the effect of these combined stressors on MR. Global increases in UVBR may therefore be contributing to amphibian population declines by compromising energy allocation towards growth and development as well as energy allocation towards coping with additional environmental stressors.",11,2012,26,1,94,103"Bassler, C; Muller, J; Svoboda, M; Lepsova, A; Hahn, C; Holzer, H; Pouska, V",Diversity of wood-decaying fungi under different disturbance regimes-a case study from spruce mountain forests,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,Article,"Rapid destruction of forest habitats has led to the establishment of protected areas in formerly managed forests with the aim of restoring biodiversity. Conservation in spruce-dominated reserves is often contradicted by salvage logging after insect outbreaks. Here we study the community characteristics of wood decaying fungi in a high montane Norway Spruce forest with three different management types: (1) a formerly managed area disturbed by a large-scale bark beetle outbreak, (2) an area with continuous salvage logging, and (3) an old-growth forest. Bark beetle activity in the disturbed area resulted in downed wood amounts comparable to those of the old-growth forest. However, species accumulation curves for the disturbed forest were more similar to those of the logged forest than to those of the old-growth forest. This arose because of differences in the diversity of wood decay classes; wood decay in the disturbed forest was more homogeneous. Logs in the disturbed forest originated almost exclusively from bark-beetle-infested trees, but the causes of tree mortality in the old-growth forest were manifold. Although most red-listed species were clearly confined to old-growth forest, Antrodiella citrinella was most abundant in the disturbed forest. Our analysis furthermore showed that the between stand scale is the most effective unit for diversity wood-decaying fungi. We therefore suggest a conservation strategy for preserving old-growth forests and establishing protected forest stands to enhance structural heterogeneity in spruce-dominated forests.

Centuries of positive interspecies interactions may enhance the reproductive and survival success of garden species selected and encouraged by experienced Maya forest gardeners. We hypothesized that such interaction may result in aggregated spatial patterns between 32 pre-selected, commonly utilized forest garden species. In this paper, we developed a novel randomization (Monte Carlo) method designed to measure and test if the spatial relationships among pairs of Maya 'forest garden' trees species differ between areas that experienced high and low ancient settlement density in northwestern Belize. A total of 28 high ancient settlement density and 27 low ancient settlement density plots containing a total of 2772 and 3134 trees, respectively, were used for this study. The analysis revealed that 58 pairs of forest garden species tended to 'cluster' together significantly more often in the high settlement density areas than would be expected in a random distribution. In low settlement density plots, only 12 pairs of species exhibited a significant clustered spatial relationship. The effect was not species specific, suggesting that some synergistic relationships, mediated by third-party agents such as dispersers, may occur at the community level. The impacts of ancient human land use, echoing across centuries of dispersal, colonization, disturbance, and biotic and abiotic interactions, can have important implications for understanding the current biodiversity patterns and processes.

Although generally facultative, Wolbachia is necessary for Asobara tabida (Hymenoptera), because aposymbiotic females do not produce any offspring. Interestingly, the ovarian phenotype of aposymbiotic females is variable: some females do not produce any eggs, whereas others do produce some eggs, but these are aborted. Here, we show that the ovarian phenotype of aposymbiotic females is highly polymorphic within populations, although dependence remains complete in both cases. We also identified some lines in which aposymbiotic females were able to produce a very few viable offspring, further extending the range of variation observed. These results suggest that various factors actively maintain polymorphism. We demonstrated that Wolbachia is necessary to trigger oogenetic processes, but that the ovarian phenotype was determined by the host only. Phenotypic variation was also correlated with the differential expression of genes controlling iron homeostasis and oxidative stress, which are potentially involved in the evolution of dependence. This suggests that variation in the ovarian phenotype could reflect selection for different levels of compensatory mechanisms in response to Wolbachia infection, and that polymorphism is maintained through selection on different antagonist traits influenced by oxidative stress.",11,2010,64,10,2969,2979"Swope, SM; Parker, IM",Trait-mediated interactions and lifetime fitness of the invasive plant Centaurea solstitialis,ECOLOGY,Article,"Plants interact with numerous enemies and mutualists simultaneously and sequentially. Such multispecies interactions can give rise to trait-mediated indirect effects that are likely to be common in nature but which are also inherently difficult to predict. Understanding multispecies interactions is also important in the use of biological control agents to control invasive plants because modern approaches to biocontrol rely on releasing multiple agents for each target weed. Centaurea solstitialis is one of the most problematic invasive weeds in California, USA, and the weevil Eustenopus villosus is its dominant biological control agent. We conducted a field experiment to quantitatively assess the direct effect of the recently approved biocontrol pathogen Puccinia jaceae f.s. solstitialis on plant performance and any indirect effects that might arise by altering the plant's interactions with Eustenopus or its pollinators (principally the nonnative Apis mellifera). We documented both synergy and interference between the two biocontrol agents depending on the life stage of the weevil. Puccinia infection increased the impact of bud-feeding by the adult weevils but reduced the impact of seed-feeding by larval weevils. Neither infection nor Eustenopus attack had an effect on pollinator visitation. The net effect was that attack by both the pathogen and the weevil did not reduce plant fitness relative to plants attacked only by the weevil. Because the consequence to the plant of interacting with one species may depend on the presence or absence of other interacting species, a careful consideration of multispecies interactions may be necessary for the selection of biocontrol agents that act in a complementary manner to reduce plant fitness. Likewise, relatively tractable weed-biocontrol systems allow us to examine multispecies interactions that can be difficult to study experimentally in native systems that are composed of numerous species with well-established populations.",11,2010,91,8,2284,2293"Ashe, E; Noren, DP; Williams, R",Animal behaviour and marine protected areas: incorporating behavioural data into the selection of marine protected areas for an endangered killer whale population,ANIMAL CONSERVATION,Article,"Like many endangered wildlife populations, the viability and conservation status of 'southern resident' killer whales Orcinus orca in the north-east Pacific may be affected by prey limitation and repeated disturbance by human activities. Marine protected areas (MPAs) present an attractive option to mitigate impacts of anthropogenic activities, but they run the risk of tokenism if placed arbitrarily. Notwithstanding recreational and industrial marine traffic, the number of commercial vessels in the local whalewatching fleet is approaching the number of killer whales to be watched. Resident killer whales have been shown to be more vulnerable to vessel disturbance while feeding than during resting, travelling or socializing activities, therefore protected-areas management strategies that target feeding 'hotspots' should confer greater conservation benefit than those that protect habitat generically. Classification trees and spatially explicit generalized additive models were used to model killer whale habitat use and whale behaviour in inshore waters of Washington State (USA) and British Columbia (BC, Canada). Here we propose a candidate MPA that is small (i.e. a few square miles), but seemingly important. Killer whales were predicted to be 2.7 times as likely to be engaged in feeding activity in this site than they were in adjacent waters. A recurring challenge for cetacean MPAs is the need to identify areas that are large enough to be biologically meaningful while being small enough to allow effective management of human activities within those boundaries.

Nitrate and phosphate loading rates were increased 10x above background levels in experimental creeks, and we significantly reduced (by 60%) the abundance of the killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus, a key predator in this system. Two creek pairs were manipulated; Creek Pair 1 for three growing seasons and Creek Pair 2 for one. Infaunal responses were examined in four habitats along the inundation gradient: mudflat, creek wall, Spartina alterniflora, and S. patens habitats. Although benthic microalgae increased synergistically in our treatments, we detected no long-term, population-level numerical response by any taxon. Similarly, no long-term species diversity or community responses were observed. However, nutrient enrichment increased the population biomass of the polychaete Manayunkia aestuarina in the creek wall habitat and the oligochaete Cernosvitoviella immota in the S. alterniflora habitat. No numerical or biomass responses of infauna were detected in predator removal treatments although indirect effects associated with killifish reduction may have contributed to an ephemeral interaction between nutrient addition and predator reduction in S. patens habitat.

We reduced the killifish Fundulus heteroclitus by similar to 60%, which elicited significant increases (2 to 4 x) in hydrobiid snails Hydrobia spp., suggesting top-own control. The talitrid amphipod Uhlorchestia spartinophila was the most abundant species of epifauna in the creek-bank Spartina alterniflora habitat. Our elevated water column nutrients (similar to 70 mu mol 1(-1) , similar to 10x background) and predator reduction treatments alone both yielded nonsignificant increases in amphipod abundance, suggesting weak top-down and bottom-up control over this species. However, treatments interacted antagonistically in this habitat such that amphipod abundances were lower than would be expected by an additive response to both treatments. We found corresponding amphipod abundance increases in the adjoining creek-wall habitat, suggesting that amphipods move under the influence of our treatments from the marsh edge onto the creek wall, possibly as a result of an increased incidence of a parasitic (i.e. trematode Levinseniella sp.) infection. Coincident to increased amphipods on creek walls, semipalmated sandpipers Calidris pusilla, amphipod predators, increasingly foraged in creek channels in combined treatments (similar to 30x higher than controls based on unreplicated creek systems). Our results suggest that top-down and bottom-up effects may at times be difficult to detect in small, single-factor studies because of inter-habitat movements of target species and redundant predation.

Methods: We evaluated the effects of a potentially invasive grass (Lolium rigidum) and water stress oil the survival, height growth and biomass of five woody species (Colutea hispanica, Gypsophila struthium, Thymus lacaitae, Lepidium subulatum and Helianthemum squamatum) from semi-arid gypsum ecosystems. Seedlings of the five species were grown with or without the potential invader and under three watering regimes: early stress - Simulating an advanced summer, late stress - simulating the characteristic timing Of Current summer drought and well-watered. Results: Seedling survival and performance were negatively affected by the presence of the potential invader. Early stress had larger impacts on the gypsum species than late stress, No interactions were found between factors for any of the study variables, and responses to both factors were found to be species-specific. Conclusions: The lack of interactions between factors indicates that the presence of the potentially invasive grass and water stress had additive effects in Our Study system. The negative impact of early water stress draws attention to the possible consequences of the advances of summer drought predicted for Mediterranean ecosystems.

The objective of this research was to experimentally test the effects of increasing and decreasing snowpack depth, increasing nitrogen, and applying prescribed fire to mixed-conifer forest understories at two sites in the central and southern Sierra Nevada. Understory response to treatments significantly differed between sites with herb biomass increasing in shrub-dominated communities when snowpack was reduced. Fire was a more important factor in post-treatment species richness and cover than either snowpack addition or reduction. Nitrogen additions unexpectedly increased herbaceous species richness. These varied findings indicate that modeling future climatic influences on biodiversity may be more difficult than additive prediction based on increasing the ecosystem's two limiting growth resources. Increasing snowpack and nitrogen resulted in increased shrub biomass production at both sites and increased herb production at the southern site.

These mortality events occur during the late summer when water temperatures are at their highest. Many theories have been proposed concerning the causes including reproductive stress, environmental stress, disease, or synergistic interactions of these factors. C gigas are grown intertidally and are exposed to the air (emersed) for hours at a time. These organisms can experience extreme changes in temperature during the course of a day. An oyster closed during emersion depletes the oxygen stores to near zero within the shell and builds up CO2 causing a decrease in tissue pH. The focus of this study is to determine the respiratory (pH, PO2, P-CO2 and total CO2) and immune responses of oysters exposed to air at normal seasonal temperatures, and to determine whether these stresses associated with emersion inhibit the immune system of the oyster and contribute to the summer mortalities. The respiratory variables of the hemolymph of oysters submerged at 18 degrees C (pH- 7.52 +/- 0.04 S.E.M., PO2 - 7.09 +/- 0.53 S.E.M. kPa and P-CO2 = 0.20 +/- 0.03 S.E.

The ability of hemocytes to kill the bacterium Vibrio campbellii was assessed using an in vitro assay to generate a killing index. There was no significant difference in the killing index between pH treatment groups (p = 0.856): at pH 7.6 killing index = 50.2% +/- 2.33 S.E.M., at pH 6.6 killing index = 52.3% +/- 3.67 S.E.M..

Matrix population models were used to assess if livestock elimination provides a proper management strategy. The merits of retrospective perturbation analyses in terms of management planning have been debated. Nevertheless, they may prove useful when applied in combination with exclosures because they may detect the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on population dynamics. Thus, the results of retrospective and prospective methods were compared. A rapid decrease in population size was projected in both areas, even though it was faster in the exposed one. The demographic processes that were favourable or detrimental in a given year were magnified outside of the fence, but buffered in the exclosure, showing a strong drought-disturbance synergism. Thus, the largest difference in the population growth rate lambda between areas was observed in the driest year. Higher nurse-plant density inside the fence seems to alleviate drought effects. The use of prospective analysis alone may lead to erroneous management decisions, since the highest elasticities corresponded to transitions that were favoured by human activities. While allowing for an increased lambda in the short term, intervention aimed at increasing these transitions further without attending others that are lessened by disturbance may introduce large changes in the population dynamics, with negative long-term consequences.

For D. serrata, crosses indicated that development time and wing size differences were due to additive genetic effects, while for viability there were digenic epistatic effects. Crosses comparing geographically close populations as well as those involving the most geographically distant populations (including the southern species border) revealed epistatic interactions, whereas crosses at an intermediate distance showed no epistasis. In D. birchii, there was no evidence of epistasis for viability, although for development time and wing size there was epistasis in the cross between the most geographically diverged populations. Strong epistasis has not developed among the D. birchii populations, and this habitat specialist does not show stronger epistasis than D. serrata.

Increased disturbance caused by human impacts is hypothesized as a primary factor promoting the spread of invaders. Plants and plant litter can have important effects on plant colonization and community composition by affecting seedling survival and growth. I examined the hypothesis that invasion of non-native Lythrum salicaria in Typha-dominated marshes is disturbance-dependent. If so, the removal of Typha plants or litter would increase the survival and growth of L. salicaria seedlings. Additionally, the removal of both plants and litter could result in an additive or synergistic effect on the establishment of L. salicaria. Alternatively, L. salicaria may be a successful invader because it has a high capacity to establish and grow regardless of neighbours. In this case, L. salicaria would be expected to perform well even in plants and litter. Strategies for managing L. salicaria will depend on which factors promote invasion. I measured the differential effects of plants and litter, alone and in combination. on the survival and growth of L. salicaria seedlings transplanted into marshes. The presence of plants and litter did not affect seedling survival in relatively dry wetland sites, indicating that L. salicaria seedlings have the capacity to persist in the presence of neighbouring Typha spp. competitors. However, removal of both plants and litter allowed increased growth of L. salicaria seedlings in drier wetlands. Therefore, growth was facilitated by disturbance that removed all vegetation. Small disturbances (0.6 m(2)) decreased competitive suppression by native Typha spp. neighbours and resulted in significant increases in growth. Disturbance of wetlands at risk of invasion by L. salicaria should be avoided.",11,2004,6,4,433,444"KIRZHNER, VM; KOROL, AB; RONIN, YI",CYCLICAL ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGES AS A FACTOR MAINTAINING GENETIC-POLYMORPHISM .1. 2-LOCUS HAPLOID SELECTION,JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,Article,"To classify different types of cyclic selection, a measure of fitness disequilibrium was used, and a class of systems were considered where this measure has the same sign in all states (sign-concordant environments). The necessary conditions for existence of a fixed point (considering any moment within the period as a referring one) are obtained for sign-concordant systems. However, analytical study of such systems, in the case of selection for equal additive genes, and numerical testing of more general situations, allowed us to conclude that no polymorphism is possible. In the alternative class of sign-nonconcordant systems, polymorphism is possible. However, we found that global stability is an exception rather than a rule for sign-nonconcordant systems. Massive numerical simulations of selection in a four-state environment were made for cycle lengths in the range 8-28 and with evenly distributed selection coefficients. The proportion of polymorphic regimes ranged up to about 1.5%, and was dependent on the recombination rate between the loci. It should be stressed, that polymorphism maintenance in the haploid systems, when it is possible, can not be considered as an effect derived from constant selection, or be a result of any hidden form of heterozygous advantage. In other words, polymorphism stability is causally connected with environmental fluctuations. Equally important is that this effect of fluctuations is only possible because of recombination: in single locus systems haploid cyclical selection is unable to produce protected polymorphism.",11,1995,8,1,93,120"GIGNAC, LD",PEATLAND SPECIES PREFERENCES - AN OVERVIEW OF OUR CURRENT KNOWLEDGE-BASE,WETLANDS,Article,"The autecology of several peatland plant species has been studied on a wide variety of gradients that include elevation relative to the water table, surface water chemistry, mire margin to mire expanse, shade, and climate.

Many studies have quantified species niche dimensions along individual gradients, and although they have the ability to predict species abundance and distribution, they do not account for synergistic effects between gradients. Other methods analyze two gradients simultaneously producing rectangles and ellipsoids, but these methods have limited predictive ability. A variety of ordination techniques are often used to analyze species preferences along several gradients simultaneously. However, with the exception of Detrended Canonical Correspondence Analysis, these methods have limited predictive ability because gradients are defined as ordination axes and it is difficult to analyze each gradient individually.

The rate of initial response, timing of selection limit, and height of the plateau varied significantly between sexes and among the four selected lines. Analyses of litter size and realized selection differentials seem to rule out counterposing natural selection as a cause of the selection limits. Animal-model analyses showed that although the additive genetic variance was significantly lower in selected than control lines, both before and after the limits, the decrease was not sufficient to explain the limits. Moreover, directional selection promoted a negative covariance between additive and maternal genetic variance over the first 10 generations.

A recent genetic model suggested that pleiotropy could account for covariations between pigmentation, behaviour, morphology, physiology and life history traits. We explored whether the expression levels of genes belonging to the melanocortin system (MC1R, POMC, PC1/3, PC2 and the antagonist ASIP), which have many pleiotropic effects, are associated with melanogenesis (through variation in the expression of the genes MITF, SLC7A11, TYR, TYRP1) and in turn melanin-based coloration. We considered the tawny owl (Strix aluco) because individuals vary continuously from light to dark reddish, and thus, colour variation is likely to stem from differences in the levels of gene expression. We measured gene expression in feather bases collected in nestlings at the time of melanin production. As expected, the melanocortin system was associated with the expression of melanogenic genes and pigmentation. Offspring of darker reddish fathers expressed PC1/3 to lower levels but tended to express PC2 to higher levels. The convertase enzyme PC1/3 cleaves the POMC prohormone to obtain ACTH, while the convertase enzyme PC2 cleaves ACTH to produce -melanin-stimulating hormone (-MSH). ACTH regulates glucocorticoids, hormones that modulate stress responses, while -MSH induces eumelanogenesis. We therefore conclude that the melanocortin system, through the convertase enzymes PC1/3 and PC2, may account for part of the interindividual variation in melanin-based coloration in nestling tawny owls. Pleiotropy may thus account for the covariation between phenotypic traits involved in social interactions (here pigmentation) and life history, morphology, behaviour and physiology.",10,2013,22,19,4915,4930"Norbury, G; Byrom, A; Pech, R; Smith, J; Clarke, D; Anderson, D; Forrester, G",Invasive mammals and habitat modification interact to generate unforeseen outcomes for indigenous fauna,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,Article,"Biotic invasions and habitat modification are two drivers of global change predicted to have detrimental impacts on the persistence of indigenous biota worldwide. Few studies have investigated how they operate synergistically to alter trophic interactions among indigenous and nonindigenous species in invaded ecosystems. We experimentally manipulated a suite of interacting invasive mammals, including top predators (cat Felis catus, ferret Mustela furo, stoat M. erminea), herbivores (rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus, hare Lepus europaeus), and an insectivore (hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus occidentalis), and measured their effects on indigenous lizards and invertebrates and on an invasive mesopredator (house mouse Mus musculus). The work was carried out in a grassland/shrubland ecosystem that had been subjected to two types of habitat modification (widespread introduction of high-seed-producing pasture species, and areas of land use intensification by fertilization and livestock grazing). We also quantified food productivity for indigenous and invasive fauna by measuring pasture biomass, as well as seed and fruit production by grasses and shrubs. Indigenous fauna did not always increase following top-predator suppression: lizards increased on one of two sites; invertebrates did not increase on either site. Mesopredator release of mice was evident at the site where lizards did not increase, suggesting negative effects of mice on lizard populations. High mouse abundance occurred only on the predator-suppression site with regular production of pasture seed, indicating that this food resource was the main driver of mouse populations. Removal of herbivores increased pasture and seed production, which further enhanced ecological release of mice, particularly where pasture swards were overtopped by shrubs. An effect of landscape supplementation was also evident where nearby fertilized pastures boosted rabbit numbers and the associated top predators. Other studies have shown that both suppression of invasive predators and retiring land from grazing can benefit indigenous species, but our results suggest that the ensuing vegetation changes and complex interactions among invasive species can block recovery of indigenous fauna vulnerable to mesopredators. Top-down and bottom-up ecological release of mesopredators and landscape supplementation of top predators are key processes to consider when managing invaded communities in complex landscapes.",10,2013,23,7,1707,1721"Williams, SL; Bracken, MES; Jones, E",Additive effects of physical stress and herbivores on intertidal seaweed biodiversity,ECOLOGY,Article,"Patterns in rocky intertidal seaweed biodiversity influence the resilience and functioning of these important primary producer communities. In turn, seaweed biodiversity patterns are the result of many ecological factors. We determined the influences of thermal and desiccation stress, herbivory, and nutrients on seaweed biodiversity on a northern California rocky shoreline. In a fully crossed design at two tidal heights at wave-protected and exposed sites, we deployed screens to reduce stress, removed herbivores, and added nutrients for 18 months. The treatments reduced temperature, increased relative humidity, decreased herbivore abundances, and increased nitrogen in both seawater and seaweeds. Seaweed abundance and biodiversity (cover, biomass, species richness, diversity, evenness, and community composition) were influenced by tidal height, physical stress, and herbivores. Wave exposure affected all response variables except biomass and evenness. Stress and herbivores had independent additive effects on seaweed abundance and diversity. Physical stress did not make the community as a whole more susceptible to herbivores, and screens had overarching positive effects on seaweed biodiversity even though they also had positive effects on herbivore abundance. Nutrients had virtually no effect on seaweed biodiversity, and we observed no bottom-up effects of nutrient addition on herbivore density or biomass. Small green algae and diatoms were important contributors to overall algal cover and to changes in composition across treatments, but larger macroalgae dominated the species richness response.

Within these regions, the Hudson Bay Lowlands are home to an overabundant breeding population of lesser snow geese that has dramatically damaged the ecosystem, with cascading effects at multiple trophic levels. In some areas the overabundance of geese has led to a drastic reduction in available forage. In addition, warming of this region has widened the gap between goose migration timing and plant green-up, and this mismatch between goose and plant phenologies could in turn affect gosling development. The dual effects of climate change and habitat quality on gosling body condition and juvenile survival are not known, but are critical for predicting population growth and related degradation of (sub) arctic ecosystems. To address these issues, we used information on female goslings marked and measured between 1978 and 2005 (4125 individuals). Goslings that developed within and near the traditional center of the breeding colony experienced the effects of long-term habitat degradation: body condition and juvenile survival declined over time. In newly colonized areas, however, we observed the opposite pattern (increase in body condition and juvenile survival). In addition, warmer than average winters and summers resulted in lower gosling body condition and first-year survival. Too few plant growing days in the spring relative to hatch led to similar results. Our assessment indicates that geese are recovering from habitat degradation by moving to newly colonized locales. However, a warmer climate could negatively affect snow goose populations in the long-run, but it will depend on which seasons warm the fastest.

Our analysis revealed that low-to-moderate levels of contamination and parasitism were not associated with gonad abnormalities in Caprolace Lake and Lesina Lagoon. On the contrary, POP concentrations and abundances of swim bladder nematodes were remarkably high in eels from the heavily urbanized Tevere River and were associated with significant gonad and swim bladder alterations. Contamination and infestation levels were so high to potentially impair spawner successful migration and reproduction. POP concentrations in Tevere eels also exceeded levels considered safe for food consumption. Though marginally contaminated, eels from the oligotrophic Caprolace Lake were in critical health condition: their lipid reserve was so low as to be considered insufficient to sustain the energetic costs of the transoceanic migration. Lesina eel stock was the only one displaying relatively good quality but here spawner abundance is likely limited by overfishing.

Just as for competition, distinguishing different modes of facilitation (mutualistic, commensal or even antagonistic) may be crucial. We therefore introduce the new concept of symmetric versus asymmetric facilitation and present a generic individual-based zone-of-influence model. The model simultaneously implements different modes of both facilitation and competition among individual plants via their overlapping zone of influence. Because we consider facilitation modes as a continuum related to environmental context, we integrated this concept with the stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH) by exploring differences in spatial pattern formation in self-thinning plants along a stress gradient in our model. The interplay among modes of interaction creates distinctly varied spatial patterns along stress gradients. When competition was symmetric, symmetric facilitation (mutualism) consistently led to plant aggregation along stress gradients. However, asymmetric facilitation (commensalism) produces plant aggregation only under more benign conditions but tends to intensify local competition and spatial segregation when conditions are harsh. When competition was completely asymmetric, different modes of facilitation contributed little to spatial aggregation. Symmetric facilitation significantly increased survival at the severe end of the stress gradient, which supports the claim of the SGH that facilitation should have generally positive net effects on plants under high stress levels. Asymmetric facilitation, however, was found to increase survival only under intermediate stress conditions, which contradicts the current predictions of the SGH. Synthesis. Our modelling study demonstrates that the interplay between modes of facilitation and competition affects different aspects of plant populations and communities, implying context-dependent outcomes and consequences. The explicit consideration of the modes and mechanisms of interactions (both facilitation and competition) and the nature of stress factors will help to extend the framework of the SGH and foster research on facilitation in plant ecology.",10,2012,100,6,1482,1491"Blomberg, EJ; Sedinger, JS; Atamian, MT; Nonne, DV",Characteristics of climate and landscape disturbance influence the dynamics of greater sage-grouse populations,ECOSPHERE,Article,"Life histories determine how organisms interact with their environment and predict how populations respond to environmental change. Understanding relationships between life histories and environmental variability is therefore crucial for effective conservation under changing environmental conditions. Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) is a species of major conservation concern in western North America following widespread disturbance of the sagebrush ecosystems to which they are endemic. Using robust design and Pradel capture-mark-recapture models, we evaluated the influence of climatic processes and disturbance associated with post-wildfire exotic grass invasion on annual survival, per-capita recruitment, and population growth of breeding male sage-grouse in eastern Nevada, USA. Climatic processes, indexed by annual rainfall and maximum summertime temperatures, had a strong relationship with recruitment and adult survival, respectively. The range of variation in recruitment during the study was greater than the range of variation in survival, consistent with a life-history strategy that features lengthened lifespan to capitalize on periodically favorable reproductive conditions. Annual variation in precipitation variables (e. g., rainfall or snow depth) explained as much as 75% of the annual variance in population size during the study. Our results are consistent with bottom-up regulation of sage-grouse populations, where abundance is determined in large part by climate-driven variation in resource availability. Exotic grasslands had a negative influence on recruitment that was interactive with annual rainfall; recruitment was consistently low in areas with a substantial exotic grassland footprint even following years of favorable rainfall. We found males breeding at leks with substantial exotic grassland impacts had lower annual survival compared to males at leks surrounded by native sagebrush habitats. However, models containing an interaction between exotic grasslands and maximum summer temperature were not clearly superior to models that considered only additive effects of the two variables.

Null models that systematically exclude and include habitat effects can give information on the contribution of these factors to community assembly. In the boreal forest, saproxylic beetles are known to be attracted to recently burned forests where they breed in dead and dying trees. We examined whether species co-occurrences of saproxylic beetles that develop in, and emerge from, boles of recently burned trees show non-random patterns. We also estimated the extent to which both the post-fire habitat attributes and interspecific interactions among beetles contribute to such patterns. We sampled tree boles encompassing key attributes (tree species, tree size/dbh and burn severity) that are thought to characterize species-habitat associations of saproxylic beetles, a proposition that we tested using indicator species analysis. Two null models with no habitat constraints (""unconstrained"") indicated that a total of 29.4% of the species pairs tested had significant co-occurrence patterns. Habitat-constrained null models indicated that most of the detected species aggregations (72%) and segregations (59%) can be explained by shared and distinct species-habitat relationships, respectively. The assembly pattern was also driven by interspecific interactions, of which some were modulated by habitat; for example, predator and prey species tended to co-occur in large-sized trees (a proxy of available bark/wood food resource primarily for the prey). In addition, some species segregation suggesting antagonistic, competitive, or prey-predator interactions were evident after accounting for the species' affinities for the same tree species. Overall, our results suggest that an intimate link between habitat and interspecific interactions can have important roles for community assembly of saproxylic assemblages even following disturbance by fire.

Such changes in land use affect the provision of various ecosystem goods and services. Therefore, it is likely that adaptation measures may result in synergies and trade-offs between a range of ecosystems goods and services. An integrative land use modelling approach is presented to assess such impacts for the European Union. A reference scenario accounts for current trends in global drivers and includes a number of important policy developments that correspond to on-going changes in European policies. The reference scenario is compared to a policy scenario in which a range of measures is implemented to regulate flood risk and protect soils under conditions of climate change. The impacts of the simulated land use dynamics are assessed for four key indicators of ecosystem service provision: flood risk, carbon sequestration, habitat connectivity and biodiversity. The results indicate a large spatial variation in the consequences of the adaptation measures on the provisioning of ecosystem services. Synergies are frequently observed at the location of the measures itself, whereas trade-offs are found at other locations. Reducing land use intensity in specific parts of the catchment may lead to increased pressure in other regions, resulting in trade-offs. Consequently, when aggregating the results to larger spatial scales the positive and negative impacts may be off-set, indicating the need for detailed spatial assessments. The modelled results indicate that for a careful planning and evaluation of adaptation measures it is needed to consider the trade-offs accounting for the negative effects of a measure at locations distant from the actual measure. Integrated land use modelling can help land use planning in such complex trade-off evaluation by providing evidence on synergies and trade-offs between ecosystem services, different policy fields and societal demands.",10,2012,27,4,473,486"Belnap, J; Munson, SM; Field, JP",Aeolian and fluvial processes in dryland regions: the need for integrated studies,ECOHYDROLOGY,Article,"Aeolian and fluvial processes play a fundamental role in dryland regions of the world and have important environmental and ecological consequences from local to global scales. Although both processes operate over similar spatial and temporal scales and are likely strongly coupled in many dryland systems, aeolian and fluvial processes have traditionally been studied separately, making it difficult to assess their relative importance in drylands, as well as their potential for synergistic interaction. Land degradation by accelerated wind and water erosion is a major problem throughout the world's drylands, and although recent studies suggest that these processes likely interact across broad spatial and temporal scales to amplify the transport of soil resources from and within drylands, many researchers and land managers continue to view them as separate and unrelated processes. Here, we illustrate how aeolian and fluvial sediment transport is coupled at multiple spatial and temporal scales and highlight the need for these interrelated processes to be studied from a more integrated perspective that crosses traditional disciplinary boundaries. Special attention is given to how the growing threat of climate change and land-use disturbance will influence linkages between aeolian and fluvial processes in the future. We also present emerging directions for interdisciplinary needs within the aeolian and fluvial research communities that call for better integration across a broad range of traditional disciplines such as ecology, biogeochemistry, agronomy, and soil conservation.

Nevertheless, there are few reports on whether levels of plant damage change as a result of fire. Here we present the results of a 1-yr study evaluating the effects of fire on rates of herbivory and damage by pathogens in leaves of cerrado (Brazilian savanna) tree species. Damage by leaf chewers was over two times greater in burned than in unburned trees. Levels of damage by leaf miners, leaf scrapers, galling insects, and leaf pathogens were relatively low and increased, remained the same, or even decreased as a result of fire. Nevertheless, in all three plant species studied, total herbivore damage was significantly greater in burned than in unburned trees given the preponderance of damage caused by leaf chewers compared with the other types of damage. Leaf chewers, mainly leaf-cutter ants, caterpillars, and grasshoppers, completely ate over 50 percent of the > 2000 leaves we marked in burned trees. That our results were consistent among different plant species with contrasting leaf phenologies suggests that the observed increase in herbivory is a general phenomenon in our study system.

There existed antagonistic inhibiting effect on urease and acid phophatase and synergistic inhibiting effect on protease under the combined pollution of Sb (III) and As (III). Only urease appeared to be the most sensitive indicator under Sb (V) and As (V) pollution, and there existed antagonistic inhibiting effect on acid phophatase and synergistic inhibiting effect on urease and protease under Sb (V) and As (V) combined pollution at most time. In this study, we also confirmed that the trivalent states of Sb and As were more toxic to all the microbes tested and more inhibitory on microbial enzyme activities then their pentavalent counterparts.

Several species of insects have been reported to reduce plant densities in some areas; however, rigorous studies that test combinations of these species and the influence of resource availability are lacking. We examined the singular and combined effects of herbivory by a root weevil (Cyphocleonus achates) and a flower head weevil (Larinus minutus) on the growth and flower production of C. stoebe. We also manipulated soil resource fertility as an additional factor that could explain the outcomes of contradictory biological control herbivore effects on C. stoebe. In a greenhouse study, herbivory by C. achates decreased flower production for plants across all resource environments. In a caged common garden study, the negative effects of herbivory also did not interact with soil nutrient status. However, the presence of plant competition further decreased knapweed growth, and the negative effects of concurrent herbivory by C. achates and L. minutus on plant biomass and flower production were additive. Derived within the context of variable levels of soil nutrient availability and competing vegetation, these results support the cumulative stress hypothesis and the contention that combined above- and belowground herbivory can reduce spotted knapweed densities and reduce the ecological and economic impacts of this species in rangelands of western North America.",10,2010,164,3,701,712"St Clair, JJH; Garcia-Pena, GE; Woods, RW; Szekely, T",Presence of mammalian predators decreases tolerance to human disturbance in a breeding shorebird,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,Article,"Nonlethal disturbance can impose fitness costs, particularly during sensitive life history stages such as reproduction. Prey animals are thus expected to assess the costs and benefits of expressing antipredator behavior in different circumstances and to respond optimally according to the perceived risk of predation.

We used landscape-level variation in the distribution of large mammalian predators (feral cats) to investigate antipredator behavior in a small breeding shorebird, the Two-banded Plover Charadrius falklandicus. We used 8 sites in the Falkland Islands and Argentina and measured the flushing distances of incubating Two-banded Plovers in response to a controlled human approach to the nest.

When the magnitude of selection exerted on a heritable sex trait differs between the sexes, it may prevent each sex to reach its phenotypic optimum. As a consequence, the benefit of expressing a sex trait to a given value may differ between males and females favouring sex-specific adaptations associated with different values of a sex trait. The level of metabolites regulated by genes that are under sex-dependent selection may therefore covary with the degree of ornamentation differently in the two sexes. We investigated this prediction in the barn owl, a species in which females display on average larger black spots on the plumage than males, a heritable ornament. This melanin-based colour trait is strongly selected in females and weakly counter-selected in males indicating sex-dependent selection. In nestling barn owls, we found that daily variation in baseline corticosterone levels, a key hormone that mediates life history trade-offs, covaries with spot diameter displayed by their biological parents. When their mother displayed larger spots, nestlings had lower corticosterone levels in the morning and higher levels in the evening, whereas the opposite pattern was found with the size of paternal spots.

To disentangle the factors responsible for its extremely low fertility we combined a microscale experimental design with a macroscale study. At the microscale we experimentally alleviated environmental stress by watering and fertilizing during two years a set of trees in one population. At macroscale we selected 11 populations across a geographical range and sampled them for three years. Macroscale patterns evidenced that both plant fertility and leaf longevity diminished with increasing elevation. Both microscale and macroscale illustrated the importance of water and nutrient availability on leaf growth and plant fertility: On the microscale experiments, regular supply of water and nutrients increased fruit-set by 300%. Macroscale showed that increases in resource availability (precipitation) resulted in reductions of seed abortion, although paralleled by increases in seed predation. Altogether, Our results indicate that fertility is constrained both by elevation and by resource limitation. Therefore any potential lift in the elevational distribution limits will result in synergistic fertility reductions due to harder physical conditions and lower water and nutrient availability. Both will compromise future regeneration of this relictual species, although population decline might be buffered temporary thanks to longevity of adult trees. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Two altitudinal gradients in the continental part of Greece. We developed a forest gap dynamics simulator that provides feedback from the stand to its water balance and flammability status. The model is used to simulate vegetation dynamics in two mountainous areas, currently found under different aridity conditions. Two climatic change scenarios (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change A1 and B2) were applied to explore differences in the response of the established forest types. In addition we explicitly accounted for the role of fire, under both current and altered climate patterns. Fire was identified to play a significant role in low-altitude sites. Its significance increased with the severity of the climate change scenario. Elevational shifts of the dominant species were simulated for each site, while in some cases these changes were associated with a shorter fire cycle and a frequent resetting of processes of vegetation change.

A before-after study of rainforest vegetation structure at multiple sites,AUSTRAL ECOLOGY,Article,"Ecological degradation within areas of remnant forest may be amplified if the effects of fragmentation interact with the effects of other environmental disturbances such as wind storms. We used before-after comparisons to assess the effects of Tropical Cyclone Larry on remnant and continuous rainforest in the Wet Tropics uplands of north-eastern Australia. Vegetation structure was measured 3 years before the cyclone and 6 months afterwards, at eight continuous forest sites and eight remnants (6-37 ha), within 20 km of the cyclone's track. The cyclone caused extensive defoliation, felling and breakage of stems and branches (greatest among the trees > 100 cm diameter which had around 50% stem loss), and increased litter and woody debris. Cyclone effects were strongly influenced by a site's spatial position (P = 0.005, 0.001 in multivariate analyses of overall damage). Maximum damage occurred 10-15 km south of the cyclone track, perhaps because of the additive effects of the west-moving air at the southern eyewall combined with the cyclone's own rapid westward movement. Most fragments were south of the cyclone track, as a consequence of spatially selective deforestation practices, and therefore, showed greatest damage. However, once the effects of spatial position were considered, the independent differences in cyclone effects between fragments and continuous forest were lost (P = 0.23, 0.41 when north-south distance was included as a covariate in analyses). The expected protection afforded by a continuous forest canopy seems to have disappeared in the face of extremely strong cyclonic winds and down-draughts. Nevertheless, an interaction between fragmentation and disturbance may yet occur, during the period of post-cyclone recovery, owing to the effects of landscape context on plant recruitment. For example, there was a higher diversity of exotic seedling germination in fragments, independent of the extent of cyclone damage.",10,2008,33,4,471,484"Corney, PM; Kirby, KJ; Le, DMG; Smart, SM; McAllister, HA; Marrs, RH",Changes in the field-layer of Wytham Woods - assessment of the impacts of a range of environmental factors controlling change,JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE,Article,"Question: What are the impacts of factors controlling patterns of change in woodland field-layer vegetation, through time?

Methods We used a spatially explicit model of landscape dynamics (ALFRESCO) to simulate vegetation changes on a 1-year time-step. The model was run for 250 years and was replicated 100 times. Results Increases in herbivory decreased the proportion of early successional vegetation and increased the proportion of late successional vegetation on the simulated landscape. Erosion and accretion worked as antagonists to herbivory, increasing the amount of early successional vegetation and decreasing the amount of late successional vegetation. However, the interactive effects of herbivory and erosion/accretion were especially important in determining system response, particularly in early seral vegetation types. High erosion rates, when coupled with low herbivory, greatly increased the proportion of willow on the landscape. When coupled with high herbivory, however, they greatly increased the proportion of alder on the landscape. At low levels of herbivory, alder abundance peaked at intermediate levels of erosion/accretion. Main conclusions Neither erosion/accretion nor herbivory produced consistent landscape patterns that could be predicted independently of the other.

Researchers have offered several hypotheses to explain the low abundance of ruffed grouse in the region, including low availability of early-successional forests due to changes in land use, additive harvest mortality, low productivity and recruitment, and nutritional stress. As part of the ACGRP, we investigated ruffed grouse population ecology. Our objectives were to estimate reproductive rates, estimate survival and cause-specific mortality rates, examine if ruffed grouse harvest in the Appalachian region is compensatory, and estimate ruffed grouse finite population growth. We trapped > 3,000 ruffed grouse in autumn (Sep-Nov) and spring (Feb-Mar) from 1996 to September 2002 on 12 study areas. We determined the age and gender of each bird and fitted them with necklace-style radiotransmitters and released them at the trap site. We tracked ruffed grouse >= 2 times per week using handheld radiotelemetry equipment and gathered data on reproduction, recruitment, survival, and mortality. Ruffed grouse population dynamics in the Appalachian region differed from the central portion of the species' range (i.e., northern United States and Canada). Ruffed grouse in the Appalachian region had lower productivity and recruitment, but higher survival than reported for populations in the Great Lakes region and southern Canada. Population dynamics differed between oak (Quercus spp.)-hickory (Carya spp.) and mixed-mesophytic forest associations within the southern and central Appalachian region. Productivity and recruitment were lower in oak-hickory forests, but adult survival was higher than in mixed-mesophytic forests. Furthermore, ruffed grouse productivity and recruitment were more strongly related to hard mast (i.e., acorn) production in oak-hickory forests than in mixed-mesophytic forests. The leading cause of ruffed grouse mortality was avian predation (44% of known mortalities). Harvest mortality accounted for 12% ofall known mortalities and appeared to be compensatory. Population models indicated ruffed grouse populations in the Appalachian region are declining (lambda = 0.7-0.95), but differences in model estimates highlighted the need for improved understanding of annual productivity and recruitment. We posit ruffed grouse in the Appalachian region exhibit a clinal population structure characterized by changes in life-history strategies. Changes in life history strategies are in response to gradual changes in forest structure, quality of food resources, snowfall and accumulation patterns, and predator communities. Management efforts should focus on creating a mosaic of forest stand ages across the landscape to intersperse habitat resources including nesting and brood cover, adult escape cover, roosting sites, and, most importantly, food resources. Land managers can intersperse habitat resources through a combination of clearcutting, shelterwood harvests, group selection, and timber stand improvement (including various thinnings and prescribed fire). Managers should maintain current ruffed grouse harvest rates while providing high quality hunting opportunities. We define high quality hunting as low hunting pressure, low vehicle traffic, and high flush rates. Managers ca provide high quality hunting opportunities through use of road closures in conjunction with habitat management.",10,2007,,168,1,36"Doroszuk, A; Brake, ET; Crespogonzalez, D; Kammenga, JE",Response of secondary production and its components to multiple stressors in nematode field populations,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,Article,"Realistic measures of the impact of individual or multiple stressors are important for ecological risk assessment. Although multiple anthropogenic stressors are common in human-dominated environments, knowledge of their influence on functional population parameters such as secondary production (P) and biomass turnover (P/B) is very limited. Secondary production integrates population characteristics such as biomass, size-frequency distribution and body growth rate, and provides a link between population and system ecologies. The influence of copper and pH stress on yearly secondary production and biomass turnover of field populations of the nematode Acrobeloides nanus was investigated by using a randomized factorial block design. The responses of the components of secondary production were also analysed in order to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the change in secondary production. Secondary production and biomass turnover showed reduced values in soil of low pH. A negative effect of copper on both parameters was observed only when the copper load was combined with low pH, otherwise higher copper concentrations resulted in higher secondary production and biomass turnover. The observed response of production and biomass turnover was mainly driven by changes in mean relative growth rate (MRGR), a measure of body growth rate estimated in a laboratory soil experiment. The biomass was higher on average in the plots with high copper load, while no significant response to pH was found. Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate that populations of soil organisms may experience strong synergistic effects of combined stressors (acidification and copper stress) on functional population parameters while showing no detrimental effects on biomass. Moreover, the effects on secondary production and biomass turnover rate are predominantly driven by effects on body growth rate.

However, understanding how focal organisms respond to these stressors is crucial for conservation planning for these species. We propose a paradigm that alternates extensive, broadscale data collection by volunteer collaborators to document patterns of response, with intensive fine-scale studies by professional researchers, to elucidate the processes underlying these patterns. We demonstrate this technique, building on our existing work linking patterns of population declines in the Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) to synergistic effects of acid rain and habitat fragmentation. To better understand the processes behind these patterns, we use a simple protocol to explore linkages between acid rain, leaching of calcium from the soil, and declines in the abundance of calcium-rich invertebrate prey species, which may be necessary for successful breeding by this thrush. We sampled at 40 study sites across New York that were chosen based on estimated acid deposition and soil properties. Our results show that the calcium content of the soils sampled is proportional to the soil pH, that the abundance of calcium-rich invertebrate prey tracks soil properties, and that the presence of a breeding Wood Thrush was correctly predicted in > 70% of study sites by the biomass of calcium-rich prey, and in particular, the biomass of myriapods (Diplopoda). We show that a simple repeatable protocol, suitable for use by volunteers across broad geographic extents and ranges of habitat fragmentation, can help us understand the reactions of some forest birds to acid rain in combination with habitat fragmentation.

Thus, large individuals avoid competition for light by emerging above the canopy and, in so doing, the BA of emergent individuals is often 'additive' to that of the rest of the individuals in a stand. The additive BA phenomenon was evident in a stratified Afrotemperate forest and was not confined to the emergent stratum but occurred also within the canopy stratum where gymnosperm BA appeared to be additive. However, there was no evidence that stand BA was at carrying capacity (i.e. presumably neither space nor nutrient resources were limiting) and there was no statistical evidence of competitive effects. We argue that avoiding competition is an insufficient explanation for how biomass accumulates in stratified forests and suggest that local variation in disturbance regime and tree life-history provide a more plausible and general explanation for current forest stand structure and dynamics.

Family variances were significantly different only for proteins and carbohydrates in hepatopancreas in the normoxic group, indicating the existence of genetic variation for these traits.

However, total variance was not significantly changed in response to hypoxia except for lactate (increased) and carotenoids (decreased) in hepatopancreas. The decrease in genetic variance without an increase in phenotypic variances in an acute response to hypoxia might be related to the known suppression of metabolic pathways that either use or produce ATP, which could result in a decreased expression of additive genes.

Previous reciprocal transplant studies of these populations indicated that subfreezing temperature is a major selective agent in Sweden. We used quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to identify the contribution of freezing tolerance to previously demonstrated local adaptation and genetic trade-offs. First, we compared the genomic locations of freezing tolerance QTL to those for previously published QTL for survival in Sweden, and overall fitness in the field. Then, we estimated the contributions to survival and fitness across both field sites of genotypes at locally adaptive freezing tolerance QTL. In growth chamber studies, we found seven QTL for freezing tolerance, and the Swedish genotype increased freezing tolerance for five of these QTL. Three of these colocalized with locally adaptive survival QTL in Sweden and with trade-off QTL for overall fitness.

Surprisingly, little is known about the general patterns, causes and consequences of whole-individual senescence in the plant kingdom. There are important differences between plants and most animals, including modular architecture, the absence of early determination of cell lines between the soma and gametes, and cellular division that does not always shorten telomere length. These characteristics violate the basic assumptions of the classical theories of senescence and therefore call the generality of senescence theories into question. This Special Feature contributes to the field of whole-individual plant senescence with five research articles addressing topics ranging from physiology to demographic modelling and comparative analyses. These articles critically examine the basic assumptions of senescence theories such as age-specific gene action, the evolution of senescence regardless of the organism's architecture and environmental filtering, and the role of abiotic agents on mortality trajectories. Synthesis. Understanding the conditions under which senescence has evolved is of general importance across biology, ecology, evolution, conservation biology, medicine, gerontology, law and social sciences. The question why is senescence universal or why is it not?' naturally calls for an evolutionary perspective. Senescence is a puzzling phenomenon, and new insights will be gained by uniting methods, theories and observations from formal demography, animal demography and plant population ecology. Plants are more amenable than animals to experiments investigating senescence, and there is a wealth of published plant demographic data that enable interpretation of experimental results in the context of their full life cycles. It is time to make plants count in the field of senescence.",9,2013,101,3,545,554"Piou, C; Prevost, E",Contrasting effects of climate change in continental vs. oceanic environments on population persistence and microevolution of Atlantic salmon,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Article,"Facing climate change (CC), species are prone to multiple modifications in their environment that can lead to extinction, migration or adaptation. Identifying the role and interplay of different potential stressors becomes a key question. Anadromous fishes will be exposed to both river and oceanic habitat changes. For Atlantic salmon, the river water temperature, river flow and oceanic growth conditions appear as three main stressing factors. They could act on population dynamics or as selective forces on life-history pathways. Using an individual-based demo-genetic model, we assessed the effects of these factors (1) to compare risks of extinction resulting from CC in river and ocean, and (2) to assess CC effects on life-history pathways including the evolution of underlying genetic control of phenotypic plasticity. We focused on Atlantic salmon populations from Southern Europe for a time horizon of three decades. We showed that CC in river alone should not lead to extinction of Southern European salmon populations. In contrast, the reduced oceanic growth appeared as a significant threat for population persistence. An increase in river flow amplitude increased the risk of local extinction in synergy with the oceanic effects, but river temperature rise reduced this risk. In terms of life-history modifications, the reduced oceanic growth increased the age of return of individuals through plastic and genetic responses. The river temperature rise increased the proportion of sexually mature parr, but the genetic evolution of the maturation threshold lowered the maturation rate of male parr. This was identified as a case of environmentally driven plastic response that masked an underlying evolutionary response of plasticity going in the opposite direction. We concluded that to counteract oceanic effects, river flow management represented the sole potential force to reduce the extinction probability of Atlantic salmon populations in Southern Europe, although this might not impede changes in migration life history.",9,2013,19,3,711,723"Soininen, J; Korhonen, JJ; Luoto, M",Stochastic species distributions are driven by organism size,ECOLOGY,Article,"The strengths of environmental drivers and biotic interactions are expected to show large variability across organism groups. We tested two ideas related to the degree of ecological determinism vs. stochasticity using a large data set comprising bacterio-, phyto-, and zooplankton. We expected that (1) there are predictable, size-driven differences in the degree to which planktonic taxa respond to different drivers such as water chemistry, biotic interactions, and climatic variables; and (2) species distribution models show lowest predictive performance for the smallest taxa due to the stochastic distributions of microbes. Generalized linear models (GLMs), generalized additive models (GAMs), and generalized boosted methods (GBMs) were constructed for 84 species to model their occurrence as a function of eight predictors. Predictive performance was measured as the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristic plot and true skill statistic (TSS) using independent model evaluation data. We found that the model performances were typically remarkably low for all planktonic groups. The proportion of satisfactory models (AUC > 0.7) was lowest for bacteria (11.1% of the models), followed by phyto- (24.2%) and zooplankton (38.1%). The occurrences of taxa within all planktonic groups were related to climatic variables to a certain degree, but bacteria showed the strongest associations with the climatic variables. Moreover, zooplankton occurrences were more related to biotic variables than the occurrences of smaller taxa, while phytoplankton occurrences were more related to water chemistry. We conclude that the occurrences of planktonic taxa are highly unpredictable and that stochasticity in occurrences is negatively related to the organism size perhaps due to efficient dispersal and fast population dynamics among the smallest taxa.",9,2013,94,3,660,670"Sayre, NF; deBuys, W; Bestelmeyer, BT; Havstad, KM",The Range Problem After a Century of Rangeland Science: New Research Themes for Altered Landscapes,RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT,Article,"The rangeland science profession in the United States has its roots in the widespread overgrazing and concurrent severe droughts of the late 19th century. These drivers contributed to rangeland resource degradation especially in the American Southwest what E. O. Wooton (1908) called the ""Range Problem."" Although logical for the time, the scientific activities and resulting policies that arose out of this catastrophe were based on reductionist experimentation and productionist emphases on food and fiber. After a century of science and policy, there are two additional perspectives that shape our vision for the emphases of the future. First, rangeland landscapes are extremely heterogeneous; general principles derived from scientific experimentation cannot be easily or generally applied without adjusting to the distinct societal and ecological characteristics of a location. Second, rangeland management occurs at spatial scales considerably larger than those that have typically been addressed in range science. Scaling up science results is not a simple, additive process. The leading features of the emerging science are 1) research at landscape scales and 2) over longer time spans that 3) approaches conservation and management practices as treatments requiring scientific evaluation, 4) incorporates local knowledge, 5) is explicitly applied in nature, and 6) is transparent in its practice.

Plant establishment is critical for community assembly, but mechanisms regulating establishment can be obscured by covarying influences of incoming seed diversity and fine-scale spatial environmental heterogeneity (microhabitat heterogeneity). Both can maximize establishment, depending on whether species differences or environmental variability more fundamentally structures plant communities. 2. We experimentally assembled limestone-pavement herb communities to examine the relative effects of seed diversity and microhabitat heterogeneity on establishment. This included testing (i) whether effects of seed diversity strengthen with heterogeneity, as would be expected if potential niche differences are more strongly expressed in more heterogeneous environments and (ii) whether a greater number of incoming species can establish in more heterogeneous environments due to environmental filtering. Species interaction theory predicts that increased facilitation and niche complementarity with realized diversity has the potential to increase overall community density. 3. Heterogeneity operated independently of seed biodiversity and explained establishment even when spatially averaged microhabitat conditions were accounted for. Homogeneous plots sown with six species supported establishment of plant density that could be increased c. 10% by doubling added seed diversity (while holding heterogeneity constant), but increased c. 40% by holding seed diversity constant and maximizing heterogeneity. 4. Ordinations revealed that species establishment was sorted by gradients in soil pH and surface cover by moss, litter and open bedrock. Regressions indicated more species established in plots featuring a greater diversity of surface cover types and/or greater soil depth variability. Community density increased with established richness, and heterogeneity ceased to explain variance in density once established richness was included as an explanatory variable. All but one of the sown species exhibited increased population density with increased plot richness. 5. Synthesis: Community density in a high-stress environment increased with both fine-scale spatial heterogeneity and added seed diversity. However, these effects were independent of one another, and impacts of heterogeneity were stronger than those of seed diversity. Our results suggest heterogeneity promotes density indirectly, through downstream effects of enhanced establishment diversity such as facilitation. These findings confirm establishment-stage interrelationships among biodiversity, density and heterogeneity as overlooked determinants of community structure by providing important field support for ideas primarily tested in the greenhouse.",9,2012,100,4,939,949"Miller, GR; Cable, JM; McDonald, AK; Bond, B; Franz, TE; Wang, LX; Gou, S; Tyler, AP; Zou, CB; Scott, RL",Understanding ecohydrological connectivity in savannas: a system dynamics modelling approach,ECOHYDROLOGY,Article,"Ecohydrological connectivity is a system level property that results from the linkages in the networks of water transport through ecosystems, by which feedbacks and other emergent system behaviours may be generated. We created a system dynamics model that represents primary ecohydrological networks to examine how connectivity between ecosystem components impacts ecosystem processes. Here, we focused on the savanna ecosystems, although the analyses may be expanded to other ecosystem types in the future. To create the model, a set of differential equations representing ecohydrological processes was programmed into the dynamic solver Vensim. Stocks of water storage (e.g. atmospheric and soil moisture) were linked by flows [e.g. precipitation and evapotranspiration (ET)] that were in turn dynamically controlled by the amount of water stored. Precipitation was forced stochastically, and soil moisture and potential ET controlled actual ET. The model produced extended, probabilistic time series of stocks and flows, including precipitation, soil moisture, runoff, transpiration, and groundwater recharge. It was used to describe the behaviour of several previously studied savanna ecosystems in North America and Africa. The model successfully reproduced seasonal patterns of soil moisture dynamics and ET at the California site. It also demonstrated more complex, system level behaviours, such as multiyear persistence of drought and synergistic or antagonistic responses to disconnection of system components. Future improvements to the model will focus on capturing other important aspects of long-term system behaviour, such as changes in physiology or phenology, and spatial heterogeneity, such as the patchwork nature of savannas.

Our primary objective here was to analyse post-fire accumulation of Cajander larch (Larix cajanderi Mayr.) aboveground biomass for a 100 000 km(2) area of open forest in far northeastern Siberia. In addition to examining effects of fire size and topography on post-fire larch aboveground biomass, we assessed regional fire rotation and density, as well as performance of burned area maps generated from MODIS satellite imagery. Using Landsat imagery, we mapped 116 fire scar perimeters that dated c. 1966-2007. We then mapped larch aboveground biomass by linking field biomass measurements to tree shadows mapped synergistically from WorldView-1 and Landsat 5 satellite imagery. Larch aboveground biomass tended to be low during early succession (<= 25 yr, 271+/-26 gm(-2), n = 66 [mean+/-SE]) and decreased with increasing elevation and northwardly aspect. Larch aboveground biomass tended to be higher during mid-succession (33-38 yr, 746+/-100 gm(-2), n = 32), though was highly variable. The high variability was not associated with topography and potentially reflected differences in post-fire density of tree regrowth. Neither fire size nor latitude were significant predictors of post-fire larch aboveground biomass. Fire activity was considerably higher in the Kolyma Mountains (fire rotation = 110 yr, fire density = 1.0+/-1.0 fires yr(-1) x 10(4) km(-2)) than along the forest-tundra border (fire rotation = 792 yr, fire density = 0.3+/-0.3 fires yr(-1) x 10(4) km(-2)). The MODIS burned area maps underestimated the total area burned in this region from 2000-2007 by 40%. Tree shadows mapped jointly using high and medium resolution satellite imagery were strongly associated (r(2) approximate to 0.9) with field measurements of forest structure, which permitted spatial extrapolation of aboveground biomass to a regional extent.

We analyzed the effect of nitrogenous compounds (NH(4) (+); NO(2) (-); NO(3) (-), both alone and in combination) on larval behavior (activity level and location in the water column) in four populations of Pelophylax perezi naturally exposed to different levels of eutrophication. Larval activity was highest and use of the bottom of the experimental beaker was lowest at lower concentrations of nitrogenous compounds acting singly, these responses being minimal and maximal, respectively, at both control and higher concentrations. This pattern appears to fit to an hormetic reponse. Additionally, the combination of nitrogenous compounds affected more severely the response variables than when ammonium or nitrite acted singly according to an additive model. Populations inhabiting highly polluted aquatic habitats marginally showed higher activity level than the populations from less polluted environments, especially when larvae were exposed to ammonium or when nitrite appeared in combination with other nitrogen forms. Levels of activity correlated positively with larval final mass. Moreover, for similar levels of activity, larvae from polluted populations had higher growth rates than those coming from reference populations which suggests interdemic differences in behavioral sensitivity to nitrogenous pollutants.",9,2011,20,6,1246,1257"Wang, Z; Xiao, BD; Song, LR; Wu, XQ; Zhang, JQ; Wang, CB","Effects of microcystin-LR, linear alkylbenzene sulfonate and their mixture on lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) seeds and seedlings",ECOTOXICOLOGY,Article,"Microcystin-LR (MCLR) and linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) are present widely in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, but their combined ecotoxicological risk is unknown. This study investigated the toxic effects of MCLR, LAS and their mixture on lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) and evaluated MCLR accumulation level in lettuce with or without LAS. The changes in seed germination and shoot/root growth, responses of the antioxidative defense system, and the accumulation of MCLR in lettuce were tested to evaluate the single and combined toxic effect of MCLR and LAS in well-controlled conditions. The results showed that seedling growth (except for root elongation and leaf weight) was more sensitive to toxicant exposure than seed germination. For seedling leaves, lipid peroxidation was not observed when the antioxidative defense system (including superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione) was activated to relieve the adverse effects of oxidative stress via different pathways. Our results also confirmed that the interaction between MCLR and LAS was synergistic. Both toxicants in combination not only significantly inhibited seedling growth, but also increased the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase, as well as the contents of glutathione. Furthermore, LAS dramatically enhanced the accumulation of MCLR in the plant, thus leading to a reduction in quality and yield and posing greater potential risk to humans via consumption of these edible plants.",9,2011,20,4,803,814"Niboyet, A; Le Roux, X; Dijkstra, P; Hungate, BA; Barthes, L; Blankinship, JC; Brown, JR; Field, CB; Leadley, PW",Testing interactive effects of global environmental changes on soil nitrogen cycling,ECOSPHERE,Article,"Responses of soil nitrogen (N) cycling to simultaneous and potentially interacting global environmental changes are uncertain. Here, we investigated the combined effects of elevated CO2, warming, increased precipitation and enhanced N supply on soil N cycling in an annual grassland ecosystem as part of the Jasper Ridge Global Change Experiment (CA, USA). This field experiment included four treatments-CO2, temperature, precipitation, nitrogen-with two levels per treatment (ambient and elevated), and all their factorial combinations replicated six times. We collected soil samples after 7 and 8 years of treatments, and measured gross rates of N mineralization, N immobilization and nitrification, along with potential rates of ammonia oxidation, nitrite oxidation and denitrification. We also determined the main drivers of these microbial activities (soil ammonium and nitrate concentrations, soil moisture, soil temperature, soil pH, and soil CO2 efflux, as an indicator of soil heterotrophic activity). We found that gross N mineralization responded to the interactive effects of the CO2, precipitation and N treatments: N addition increased gross N mineralization when CO2 and precipitation were either both at ambient or both at elevated levels. However, we found limited evidence for interactions among elevated CO2, warming, increased precipitation, and enhanced N supply on the other N cycling processes examined: statistically significant interactions, when found, tended not to persist across multiple dates. Soil N cycling responded mainly to single-factor effects: long-term N addition increased gross N immobilization, potential ammonia oxidation and potential denitrification, while increased precipitation depressed potential nitrite oxidation and increased potential ammonia oxidation and potential denitrification. In contrast, elevated CO2 and modest warming did not significantly affect any of these microbial N transformations.

We compared the species richness and composition of deadwood-associated beetle assemblages among undisturbed, recently burned, logged, and salvage-logged, boreal, mixed-wood stands. Species richness was lowest in salvage-logged stands, largely due to a negative effect of harvesting on the occurrence of wood- and bark-boring species. In comparison with undisturbed stands, the combination of wildfire and logging in salvage-logged stands had a greater effect on species composition than either disturbance alone. Strong differences in species composition among stand treatments were linked to differences in quantity and quality (e.g., decay stage) of coarse woody debris. We found that the effects of wildfire and logging on deadwood-associated beetles were synergistic, such that the effects of postfire salvage logging could not be predicted reliably on the basis of data on either disturbance alone.

One trait that shows abundant evidence for naturally segregating genetic variance in different populations of D. melanogaster is cold tolerance. Previous work has found quantitative trait loci (QTL) exclusively on the second and the third chromosomes. To gain insight into the genetic architecture of cold tolerance on the X chromosome and to compare the results with our analyses of selective sweeps, a mapping population was derived from a cross between substitution lines that solely differed in the origin of their X chromosome: one originates from a European inbred line and the other one from an African inbred line. We found a total of six QTL for cold tolerance factors on the X chromosome of D. melanogaster. Although the composite interval mapping revealed slightly different QTL profiles between sexes, a coherent model suggests that most QTL overlapped between sexes, and each explained around 5-14% of the genetic variance (which may be slightly overestimated). The allelic effects were largely additive, but we also detected two significant interactions. Taken together, this provides evidence for multiple QTL that are spread along the entire X chromosome and whose effects range from low to intermediate. One detected transgressive QTL influences cold tolerance in different ways for the two sexes. While females benefit from the European allele increasing their cold tolerance, males tend to do better with the African allele.

This analysis examined shifts in larval fish community composition in the southeastern Bering Sea in response to environmental variability across both warm and cold periods. Larvae were sampled in spring (May) during 5 cruises between 2002 and 2008 using oblique 60 cm bongo tows. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was used to quantify variability and reduce multi-species abundance data to major modes of species composition. Generalized additive models (GAMs) characterized spatial and temporal differences in assemblage structure as a function of environmental covariates. We identified a strong cross-shelf gradient delineating slope and shelf assemblages, an influence of water masses from the Gulf of Alaska on species composition, and the importance of nearshore areas for larval fish. Species assemblages differed between warm and cold periods, and larval abundances were generally greater in warm years. High abundances of walleye pollock in warm years contributed most to differences in Unimak Pass, outer domain, and shelf areas (geographic areas in the study region defined based on bathymetry). Sebastes spp. contributed to differences over the slope with increased abundances in cold years.

Because AMF can improve water relations, colonization by these root symbionts may increase the host's tolerance of drought especially when roots have been compromised by herbivory. This full factorial study examined effects of AMF, water deficit, and artificial root herbivory in three genotypes of wild strawberry, Fragaria virginiana Duchesne that originated from the same restored tallgrass prairie as the AMF inoculum. Drought stress and root damage altered allocation to roots vs. shoots but the effects were not additive and the interaction did not depend on AMF treatment. Effects of AMF were absent with one exception: root damage significantly reduced belowground mass only in plants inoculated with AMF. Although drought stress did not interact with the AMF treatment, both drought stress and root damage reduced the abundance of arbuscules, and especially vesicles, and colonization varied among genotypes. Failure to detect strong effects of AMF on host growth could be due to variable responses of individual AMF species summing to no net effects.

We showed that the conditions that allow metapopulation persistence under the synergistic action of genetic and demographic processes depart significantly from predictions based on a mere superposition of the effects of each process separately. Moreover, an optimal dispersal rate exists that maximizes the range of survival rates of dispersers under which metapopulation persists and at the same time allows the largest sustainable patch removal and patch-size reduction. The relative impact of patch removal and patch-size reduction depends both on matrix quality and the dispersal strategy of the species: metapopulation persistence is more affected by patch-size reduction (patch removal) for low (high)-dispersing species, in presence of a low (high) quality matrix. Avoidance of inbreeding, through increased dispersal when the rate of inbreeding in a population is large, has positive effects on low-dispersing species, but impairs the persistence of high-dispersing species.

Organism: Drosophila koepferae, which mainly breeds on the patchily distributed Trychocereus cacti, and D. buzzatii, which mainly occurs on the more abundant and uniformly distributed Opuntia cacti. Methods: Flies were reared under standardized conditions from three sympatric populations. Longevity and mortality rate were studied both at 25 degrees C and 29.5 degrees C. Age-specific fecundity was estimated at 25 degrees C. Other plausibly associated traits were also studied, including heat-shock resistance, Hsp70 expression and body size. Conclusions: Senescence rate was much faster in D. koepferae than in D. buzzatii in all populations at 25 degrees C but not at 29.5 degrees C. The interspecific difference in longevity at 25 degrees C shifted in sign in one of the populations at 29.5 degrees C. Neither the resistance to a heat shock nor the heat-induced Hsp70 expression showed significant interspecific variation. Body size was larger in D. koepferae than in D. buzzatii. Drosophila koepferae showed a massive reproductive output. at early ages compared with D. buzzatii.

We undertook a meta-analysis, using data from 118 studies to test the hypothesis that ongoing global declines in the dominant habitat along temperate rocky coastlines, forests of canopy-forming algae and/or their replacement by mat-forming algae are driven by the nonadditive interactions between local anthropogenic stressors that can be addressed through management actions (fishing, heavy metal pollution, nutrient enrichment and high sediment loads) and other stressors (presence of competitors or grazers, removal of canopy algae, limiting or excessive light, low or high salinity, increasing temperature, high wave exposure and high UV or CO2), not as easily amenable to management actions. In general, the cumulative effects of local anthropogenic and other stressors had negative effects on the growth and survival of canopy-forming algae. Conversely, the growth or survival of mat-forming algae was either unaffected or significantly enhanced by the same pairs of stressors. Contrary to our predictions, the majority of interactions between stressors were additive. There were however synergistic interactions between nutrient enrichment and heavy metals, the presence of competitors, low light and increasing temperature, leading to amplified negative effects on canopy-forming algae. There were also synergistic interactions between nutrient enrichment and increasing CO2 and temperature leading to amplified positive effects on mat-forming algae. Our review of the current literature shows that management of nutrient levels, rather than fishing, heavy metal pollution or high sediment loads, would provide the greatest opportunity for preventing the shift from canopy to mat-forming algae, particularly in enclosed bays or estuaries because of the higher prevalence of synergistic interactions between nutrient enrichment with other local and global stressors, and as such it should be prioritized.",8,2014,20,11,3300,3312"O'Regan, SM; Palen, WJ; Anderson, SC",Climate warming mediates negative impacts of rapid pond drying for three amphibian species,ECOLOGY,Article,"Anthropogenic climate change will present both opportunities and challenges for pool-breeding amphibians. Increased water temperature and accelerated drying may directly affect larval growth, development, and survival, yet the combined effects of these processes on larvae with future climate change remain poorly understood. Increased surface temperatures are projected to warm water and decrease water inputs, leading to earlier and faster wetland drying. So it is often assumed that larvae will experience negative synergistic impacts with combined warming and drying. However, an alternative hypothesis is that warming-induced increases in metabolic rate and aquatic resource availability might compensate for faster drying rates, generating antagonistic larval responses. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to test the individual and interactive effects of pool permanency (permanent vs. temporary) and water temperature (ambient vs. +similar to 3 degrees C) on three anurans with fast-to-slow larval development rates (Great Basin spadefoot [Spea intermontana], Pacific chorus frog [Pseudacris regilla], and northern red-legged frog [Rana aurora]). We found that although tadpoles in warmed pools reached metamorphosis 15-17 days earlier, they did so with little cost (<2 mm) to size, likely due to greater periphyton growth in warmed pools easing drying-induced resource competition. Warming and drying combined to act antagonistically on early growth (P = 0.06) and survival (P = 0.06), meaning the combined impact was less than the sum of the individual impacts. Warming and drying acted additively on time to and size at metamorphosis. These nonsynergistic impacts may result from cotolerance of larvae to warming and drying, as well as warming helping to offset negative impacts of drying. Our results indicate that combined pool warming and drying may not always be harmful for larval amphibians. However, they also demonstrate that antagonistic responses are difficult to predict, which poses a challenge to proactive conservation and management.

Using an invertebrate rock pool metacommunity in South Africa as a natural model system, we studied potential interactive effects of disturbance regime and patch isolation on diversity patterns of species with contrasting dispersal modes (passive vs. active dispersal). Isolation and disturbance regime had negative synergistic effects on alpha diversity: both directly, by excluding late-successional species from isolated patches; and indirectly, by modulating establishment success of generalist predators in well-connected patches. Unimodal relationships between isolation and alpha diversity, as predicted by mass effects, were only detected for passive dispersers in frequently disturbed patches and not in active dispersers. For passive dispersers, indications for a positive effect of isolation and a negative effect of disturbance on beta diversity were found, presumably due to differences in deterministic succession and stochastic colonization-extinction dynamics among different patch types. Our findings illustrate that interactions between dispersal rates and disturbance regime are important when explaining species diversity patterns in metacommunities and support the idea that diversity in frequently disturbed habitats is more sensitive to effects of dispersal-based processes.",8,2013,94,11,2547,2557"Stephens, AEA; Srivastava, DS; Myers, JH",Strength in numbers?

In particular, a predictive framework is lacking for when to expect enemies to have independent versus non-independent effects on their host plant. This is problematic for weed biological control programmes where multiple enemies are frequently released with the possibility of antagonistic interactions that may reduce control. Here, we conduct an analysis of 74 unique plant-enemy-enemy combinations from 51 studies to determine the frequency of non-independent effects of natural enemies on host plant performance, and test a number of a priori predictions for determinants of independent and antagonistic effects of multiple enemies. For three-quarters of plant response measurements, enemies had independent effects on plant performance. In most of the remainder, multiple enemies led to less reduction in performance than that predicted from each enemy alone. Antagonistic effects occurred when enemies attacked the same plant part concurrently or attacked plant reproductive structures. These two predictors explained why antagonistic effects were particularly prevalent for weeds, plants in the family Asteraceae and enemies in the order Diptera.

Here we study the molecular basis of G x G interactions in a model legume-rhizobium mutualism using gene expression microarrays. We find that, like quantitative traits such as fitness, variation in the symbiotic transcriptome may be partitioned into additive and interactive genetic components. Our results suggest that plant genetic variation had the largest influence on nodule gene expression and that plant genotype and the plant genotype x rhizobium genotype interaction determine global shifts in rhizobium gene expression that in turn feedback to influence plant fitness benefits.

Modern land-use practices often result in small and isolated populations, increasing the risk of extinction through reduced genetic diversity as a consequence of inbreeding or drift. Such genetic erosion may also interfere with a population's evolutionary potential. In this study, we investigate the consequences of inbreeding on evolutionary potential (the ability to increase cold resistance) in a laboratory population of the tropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana. To explore constraints on evolution, we applied artificial selection to chill-coma recovery time, starting from three levels of inbreeding (outbred control, one or two full-sibling matings). Ten generations of selection produced highly divergent phenotypes, with the lines selected for increased cold tolerance showing about 28% shorter recovery times after cold exposure relative to unselected controls. Correlated responses to selection in 10 different life-history and stress-resistance traits were essentially absent. Inbred lines showed a weaker response to selection, indicating reduced evolutionary potential and thereby constraints on evolution. Inbreeding depression was still measurable in some traits after the course of selection. Traits more closely related to fitness showed a clear fitness rebound, suggesting a trait-specific impact of purging.

These spatio-temporal dynamics are driven by the combined effect of three components: (i) an additive white Gaussian noise, accounting for external random disturbances such as fires or fluctuations in rain water availability, (ii) a weak periodic modulation in time, describing hydrological drivers such as seasonal fluctuations of water table depth, and (iii) a spatial coupling term, which takes into account the ability of vegetation to spread and colonize other parts of the landscape.

A mathematical model (to be published separately) of the gene regulatory circuit controlling mtl production predicted that chemically similar divalent metals (classic inducers) should show additive effects on mtl gene induction, whereas chemically dissimilar metals should show interference. These predictions were verified experimentally; thus cadmium and mercury showed additive effects, whereas ferric iron (a weak inducer) significantly reduced the effect of mercury. We applied a similar battery of tests to diluted samples of soil pore water extracted centrifugally after mixing 20% w/w ultrapure water with air-dried soil from an abandoned lead/zinc mine in the Murcia region of Spain. In addition, metal contents of both soil and soil pore water were determined by ICP-MS, and simplified mixtures of soluble metal salts were tested at equivalent final concentrations. The effects of extracted soil pore water (after tenfold dilution) were closely mimicked by mixtures of its principal component ions, and even by the single most prevalent contaminant (zinc) alone, though other metals modulated its effects both positively and negatively.

Despite their natural prominence in reef-building corals and widespread use in biotechnology, their biological role remains obscure. Here, we experimented with larvae of Acropora millepora to determine what can be learned about a coral larva or recruit from its fluorescent colour. We performed 12 crosses between seven A. millepora colonies representing differing fluorescence phenotypes, the larvae of which were exposed to a natural settlement cue (crustose coralline algae) and heat-light stress. Parental effects explained 18 per cent of variation in colour and 47 per cent of variation in settlement. The colour of the larval family emerged as a predictor of the settlement success: redder families were significantly less responsive to the provided settlement cue (p 0.006). This relationship was owing to a correlation between parental effects on settlement and colour (r 2 0.587, p 0.045). We also observed pronounced (16%) decline in settlement rate, as well as subtle (2%), but a statistically significant decrease in red fluorescence, as a consequence of heat-light stress exposure. Variation in settlement propensity in A. millepora is largely owing to additive genetic effects, and is thought to reflect variation in dispersal potential.

Metrics have become a standard way for summarizing environmental monitoring results. Different metrics react differently to natural variations and human-induced stressors. We suggest that combined analysis of time trends in selected biological metrics allows identification of biological processes (e.g. individual growth, mortality or recruitment) that have changed (increased or decreased) persistently. Alternatively, time trends in the abundance of sensitive species could indicate changes in environmental stressors. 2. We calculate the joint likelihood of time trends in three metrics and use it to evaluate the evidence in the data for different combinations of metric time trends. A simulation study provides guidelines for interpreting log-likelihood differences. 3. We illustrate the approach for identifying biological process changes for three North Sea fish stocks (cod Gadus morhua, lesser-spotted dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula and whiting Merlangius merlangius) using metrics derived from international bottom-trawl survey data for the period 1997-2008. Over the period, a decrease in recruitment and several simultaneous process changes were most likely for cod, while a recruitment increase, mortality decrease and several process changes were most likely for lesser-spotted dogfish. No significant persistent process changes were found for whiting. 4. Synthesis and applications. The likelihood approach offers a way of combining monotonic time trends in multiple metrics for identifying persistent changes in exploited populations or environmental stressors, given suitable metric time series and tables for interpreting joint time trends. For data rich fish populations, the proposed method can supplement analytical stock assessments.

Although grazing lands and rodent habitats overlap, the combined effects of livestock and rodent disturbance on spatial heterogeneity of plants and soil have rarely been evaluated. We established study plots at each of four sites: sites heavily grazed by livestock, with and without marmots, and ungrazed sites, with and without marmots. We subdivided each plot into quadrats to survey the plant species composition and soil nutrient properties, and calculated the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation at three spatial scales using non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis. We also calculated the coefficient of variance among the soil samples. The vegetation's spatial heterogeneity did not differ significantly between grazed and ungrazed plots; however, it was higher under marmot disturbance than in the absence of marmots at a fine scale, but lower under marmot disturbance at a coarse scale, irrespective of livestock grazing. At a fine scale, unique habitats were formed by each combination of livestock grazing (presence/absence) and marmots (presence/absence). In addition, the plant species composition in the grazed plots was distinct from that in the ungrazed plots at the coarser scale. The occurrence of degradation-indicator plant species depended on the presence of grazing rather than on the additive effect of grazing and marmots. Marmots increased the abundance of degradation-indicator species only in the ungrazed plots. Each herbivore group increased the spatial heterogeneity of soil nutrients at coarser scales, but these influences were lost when both herbivore groups coexisted. These results show that the ecological roles of livestock and marmots are complementary, not functionally equivalent. That is, livestock modified the overall vegetation composition, and thereby modified spatial heterogeneity at the landscape scale, whereas marmots modified spatial heterogeneity at the local scale. Proper manipulation of the livestock grazing regime can maintain species-rich communities without serious land degradation in the Mongolian steppe. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In fruit-inhabiting Drosophila, variation in insect developmental success is not only determined by species-specific effects of various noxious filamentous fungi but, as suggested by an earlier study, also by additive genetic variation in the ability to successfully withstand the negative impact of the fungi. If this variation represents a direct adaptive response to the degree to which insect breeding substrates are infested with harmful fungi, genetic variation for successful development in the presence of fungi could be maintained by variation in infestation of resource patches with fungi. We selected for the ability to resist the negative influence of mould by maintaining replicated Drosophila melanogaster populations on substrates infested with Aspergillus nidulans. After five cycles of exposure to the fungus during the larval stage, the selected populations were compared with unselected control populations regarding adult survival and reproduction to reveal an evolved resistance against the fungal competitor. On fungus-infested larval feeding substrates, emerged adults from mould-selected populations had higher survival rates and higher early fecundity than the control populations. In the unselected populations, females had higher mortality rates than males, and a high proportion of both females and males appeared to be unable to lay eggs or fertilise eggs, respectively. When larvae developed on non-infested food we found indications of a loss of resistance to abiotic and starvation stress in the adult stage in flies from the selected populations.

We tested the hypothesis that different species assemblages of grassland communities may partly result from interactive influences between the relative invasiveness of available species and community invasibility. During 10 months, we evaluated seed and microsite limitation of seedling emergence, survival, and recruitment of plants belonging to species with different seed size (large-seeded species vs. small-seeded species), with in a two-phase community mosaic typical of semi-natural grasslands in the southern flooding Pampa of Argentina. Seeds of large versus small-seeded species were sown either in species-poor patches dominated by a tall tussock grass (""pajonal"") or in species-rich patches dominated by short grasses (""matrix""), subjected to different levels of canopy disturbance (cut vs. uncut). Seed addition promoted seedling emergence for 7 out of the 10 species sown, and this effect was higher for large than for small-seeded species. After seed limitations were removed, interactive effects among seed size, community state and canopy disturbance reflected a strong positive influence of seed size on plant recruitment only in cut pajonal patches. Therefore, according to the stage of invasion process, relative species success may depend on non-interactive (seed-size effect on seed limitation to seedling emergence) or interactive influences among species invasibility and community invasiveness (from seedling emergence to plant recruitment).

Species tend to be more closely related to each other than would be expected if they were assembled at random. Thus marine soft-sediment macrofauna are not locally assembled at random from regional species pools and it is likely that regional processes determine the assembly of communities. Focusing on the most abundant class within the macrofauna, a different pattern emerges, in that there is a much stronger tendency for local polychaete composition to be a random subset from regional pools at all scales. Thus it is not possible to determine whether local polychaete diversity is independent of both local and regional processes, or determined by a combination of both acting antagonistically.",8,2009,382,,279,286"Zhu, J; Lu, YT; Chen, WC",Single and joint toxic effects of cadmium and phenanthrene on enchytraeid Fridericia bulbosa,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY,Article,"The toxic effects of single and joint stress of Cd (cadmium) and Phe (phenanthrene) on enchytraeid Fridericia bulbosa were investigated by natural soil tests. Mortality of single and joint stress of Cd and Phe was significant (p < 0.01) except the lowest concentration of single pollutant. There was a positive correlation between mortality and the concentration of pollutant added to soil. Also, the more exposed to single or joint Cd and Phe, the more morality. For joint pollution, Cd was the main contributive factor of toxic effects, the different concentration and interaction of Cd and Phe significantly influenced mortality (p < 0.01). The joint effects of Cd and Phe were additive, after a 14-d exposure. When Phe was 0.1 mg kg(-1) and 1.6 mg kg(-1), the interactive effects between Cd and Phe were synergistic. When Phe was 25.6 mg kg(-1), the interactive effects were antagonistic. It suggested that morality may be considered as a valuable and sensitive biomarker to diagnose adverse effects of Cd or Phe in soil environment. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

At the same time, plant diversity and species composition are altered in alpine ecosystems by human impacts such as skiing. Therefore, we investigated impacts of decreased species richness and ski piste treatments on ecosystem functions in subalpine grassland. Species richness manipulations were combined with nutrient input from snow cover treated with snow additives that are commonly used on ski pistes. Three different species richness levels containing 1, 3 or 9 species randomly selected from a larger pool plus unmanipulated meadow plots were treated with four water types to simulate melt water. One water type contained the snow additive ammonium nitrate. Invasion into the communities was prevented by weeding during 2 years and allowed in three subsequent years. Higher species richness increased plant cover and biomass and decreased their variation. The number of functional groups in a plant assemblage had a positive effect on plant growth. Ammonium nitrate strongly increased biomass and plant cover after a single application but decreased species richness in originally diverse meadow plots. There was no significant interaction between species richness and water-type treatments. After the cessation of weeding, the species richness of different plot types converged within 3 years due to invasion. Nevertheless, relationships between initial species richness and plant cover remained positive. The results suggest that the diversity and species composition of alpine vegetation are important factors influencing cover and biomass, in particular during re-colonization of bare ground after disturbances such as ski-piste construction. In slow-growing alpine vegetation, initially positive diversity effects may remain even after successional convergence of species richness due to invasion. The negative effect of ammonium nitrate on species richness suggests the snow additives should only be used with care. (C) 2007 Rubel Foundation, ETH Zurich. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

Such events are predicted to have adverse physiological effects on individuals and may result in mortality. In a series of laboratory experiments, the impact of simulated monsoonal rains was investigated on the patellid limpet, Cellana grata. Sub-lethal responses in terms of body water content, body fluid osmolality and heart rate were measured in two different size cohorts maintained on horizontal and vertical substrata. Limpets were unable to achieve any effective behavioural isolation, and exposure to either simulated rainfall or diluted seawater resulted in both large and small C grata gaining water with subsequent dilution of mantle water and haemolymph osmolalities. With increased duration of rainfall, dilution of body fluids increased with little difference between individuals on horizontal and vertical surfaces. Body fluids generally showed proportional dilution during prolonged rain, but in some individuals there was evidence for regulation of the haemolymph relative to the mantle fluid. Overall, smaller limpets were more susceptible to prolonged rainfall than large animals in terms of swelling of soft tissues and detachment and also had higher heart rates than large limpets. Both cohorts reduced heart rates with prolonged rainfall, suggesting a degree of metabolic depression, especially on horizontal surfaces. In small limpets, no difference in heart rate was found with substratum orientation, whereas large limpets had elevated heart rates on vertical as compared to horizontal substrata, when exposed to either simulated rainfall or washed with dilute seawater. This may reflect the increased energetic costs required to maintain a relatively larger body on a vertical surface under stressful conditions. Monsoonal rainfall during emersion, and subsequent dilution of seawater, therefore, have sub-lethal physiological and possible lethal effects on intertidal limpets. This influence has been largely overlooked, but coupled with the possible synergistic effects of thermal stress, monsoon rains are likely to play an important role in community dynamics on tropical shores.

Two tropical lowland maize populations were used in this study to quantify the magnitude of genetic variability in osmotic adjustment; to estimate components of its genetic variance and heritability; and to determine the importance of this trait in breeding tropical maize for improved drought tolerance. Full-sibs within half-sib groups were developed using the Design I mating scheme and evaluated at two locations in Mexico for two seasons using water stress and non-stress environments. Results showed that in both populations, dominance genetic effects were more important than additive effects in controlling the expression of the trait.

Habitat structure is important in explaining species diversity patterns for many animal groups. If we could map habitat structure over large spatial scales, we could use habitat structure-species diversity (HS-SD) relationships to model species diversity and inform conservation planning and management. Traditional approaches for measuring habitat structure cannot be applied over entire landscapes, but remote sensing tools are now able to overcome this limitation. Here, we explore the potential of airborne lidar for the assessment and monitoring of animal species diversity in terrestrial environments. 2. We review the habitat attributes commonly recorded in the study of HS-SD relationships and the spatial scale of their measurement, in papers published between 1960 and 2013. We also gather evidence for the use of lidar to make relevant measurements at similar scales. 3. Eight out of 15 attributes of habitat structure commonly used in published studies relate to the vertical dimension of habitat. The core strength of lidar is that it is a vertical profiler, and this technology can be used to derive estimates of all but one of these structural attributes. Lidar can also be used to improve the measurement of the four commonly used attributes focusing on the horizontal heterogeneity of habitat patches. The spatial grain and extent of HS-SD studies is usually within the operational capability of airborne lidar; when a vertical measure of habitat structure has been employed, this is true in 84% of published studies. The potential efficacy of lidar in this field of biodiversity studies is underlined by several published examples of lidar modelling of animal species diversity. 4. We conclude that lidar remote sensing is fit for the purpose of biodiversity assessment and monitoring through its ability to characterize habitat structure, a key driver of animal species diversity, over large spatial scales. We advocate wider application of lidar-based HS-SD indicators to help tackle the current biodiversity crisis. In combination with other remote sensing products, these indicators may support the implementation and monitoring of environmental legislation, inform gap analyses and the planning of management actions for protected areas and species, and drive greater synergy with forest-based climate change mitigation.",7,2014,5,8,719,729"Kremer, A; Potts, BM; Delzon, S",Genetic divergence in forest trees: understanding the consequences of climate change,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,Article,"1Predicted climate change is heading in many respects into untested environmental conditions for trees and to the reshuffling of species distributions. We explore the consequences that these changes are likely to have on population differentiation of adaptive traits. Superimposed on the spatial redistribution of the species, will there be a redistribution of their genetic variation? We base our predictions on a conceptual framework, whose elements are the extant differentiation, and the predicted divergent evolution of populations along purposely chosen altitudinal/latitudinal gradients. We consider simultaneously phenotypic and genetic divergence, but emphasize genetically driven population differentiation. We illustrate phenotypic and genetic patterns of variation with examples from well-studied northern and southern hemisphere tree genera Quercus and Eucalyptus. Most phenotypic traits show very large in situ clinal variation with variation in altitude or latitude. Genetic clines detected in common gardens usually follow the observed in situ phenotypic clines, reflecting cogradient variation. Rare counter gradients have also been detected, where phenotypic and genetic clines exhibit opposing signs. These patterns suggest that plasticity and selection contributed in most cases synergistically to the extant differentiation. We anticipate that microevolutionary processes will be different along environmental gradients. At the leading edge, availability of newly suitable habitats will trigger migration favouring genotypes equipped with colonists attributes. At the rear edges of the distribution, populations will be submitted to strong selective pressures favouring genotypes capable of withstanding drought and heat stress. Central populations will benefit from the plastic response of trees that will temporarily compensate for the maladaptation, until genetic adaptive variation will be restored by gene flow, mutation or recombination. We make predictions about future differentiation along environmental gradients, by highlighting traits that are likely to diverge, the rate at which differentiation will take place, and the role of gene flow and hybridization. We envisage that parallel selection may maintain differentiation at extant levels, whereas divergent selection will promote substantial differentiation for traits facilitating adaptation to contrasting conditions along the environmental gradient. We anticipate that genetic divergence may occur very rapidly and will be enhanced by the multilocus architecture of most adaptive traits.",7,2014,28,1,22,36"Spiesman, BJ; Inouye, BD",Habitat loss alters the architecture of plant-pollinator interaction networks,ECOLOGY,Article,"Habitat loss can have a negative effect on the number, abundance, and composition of species in plant-pollinator communities. Although we have a general understanding of the negative consequences of habitat loss for biodiversity, much less is known about the resulting effects on the pattern of interactions in mutualistic networks. Ecological networks formed by mutualistic interactions often exhibit a highly nested architecture with low modularity, especially in comparison with antagonistic networks. These patterns of interaction are thought to confer stability on mutualistic communities. With the growing threat of environmental change, it is important to expand our understanding of the factors that affect biodiversity and the stability of the communities that provide critical ecosystem functions and services. We studied the effects of habitat loss on plant-pollinator network architecture and found that regional habitat loss contributes directly to species loss and indirectly to the reorganization of interspecific interactions in a local community. Networks became more highly connected and more modular with habitat loss. Species richness and abundance were the primary drivers of variation in network architecture, though species compositi n affected modularity. Theory suggests that an increase in modularity with habitat loss will threaten community stability, which may contribute to an extinction debt in communities already affected by habitat loss.",7,2013,94,12,2688,2696"Johnson, SN; Mitchell, C; McNicol, JW; Thompson, J; Karley, AJ",Downstairs drivers - root herbivores shape communities of above-ground herbivores and natural enemies via changes in plant nutrients,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,Article,"1. Terrestrial food webs are woven from complex interactions, often underpinned by plant-mediated interactions between herbivores and higher trophic groups. Below-and above-ground herbivores can influence one another via induced changes to a shared host plant, potentially shaping the wider community. However, empirical evidence linking laboratory observations to natural field populations has so far been elusive. 2. This study investigated how root-feeding weevils (Otiorhynchus sulcatus) influence different feeding guilds of herbivore (phloem-feeding aphids, Cryptomyzus galeopsidis, and leaf-chewing sawflies, Nematus olfaciens) in both controlled and field conditions. 3. We hypothesized that root herbivore-induced changes in plant nutrients (C, N, P and amino acids) and defensive compounds (phenolics) would underpin the interactions between root and foliar herbivores, and ultimately populations of natural enemies of the foliar herbivores in the field. 4. Weevils increased field populations of aphids by ca. 700%, which was followed by an increase in the abundance of aphid natural enemies. Weevils increased the proportion of foliar essential amino acids, and this change was positively correlated with aphid abundance, which increased by 90% on plants with weevils in controlled experiments. 5. In contrast, sawfly populations were 77% smaller during mid-June and adult emergence delayed by > 14 days on plants with weevils. In controlled experiments, weevils impaired sawfly growth by 18%, which correlated with 35% reductions in leaf phosphorus caused by root herbivory, a previously unreported mechanism for above-ground-below-ground herbivore interactions. 6. This represents a clear demonstration of root herbivores affecting foliar herbivore community composition and natural enemy abundance in the field via two distinct plant-mediated nutritional mechanisms. Aphid populations, in particular, were initially driven by bottom-up effects (i.e. plant-mediated effects of root herbivory), but consequent increases in natural enemies triggered top-down regulation.",7,2013,82,5,1021,1030"Vogel, A; Eisenhauer, N; Weigelt, A; Scherer-Lorenzen, M",Plant diversity does not buffer drought effects on early-stage litter mass loss rates and microbial properties,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Article,"Human activities are decreasing biodiversity and changing the climate worldwide. Both global change drivers have been shown to affect ecosystem functioning, but they may also act in concert in a non-additive way. We studied early-stage litter mass loss rates and soil microbial properties (basal respiration and microbial biomass) during the summer season in response to plant species richness and summer drought in a large grassland biodiversity experiment, the Jena Experiment, Germany. In line with our expectations, decreasing plant diversity and summer drought decreased litter mass loss rates and soil microbial properties. In contrast to our hypotheses, however, this was only true for mass loss of standard litter (wheat straw) used in all plots, and not for plant community-specific litter mass loss. We found no interactive effects between global change drivers, that is, drought reduced litter mass loss rates and soil microbial properties irrespective of plant diversity. High mass loss rates of plant community-specific litter and low responsiveness to drought relative to the standard litter indicate that soil microbial communities were adapted to decomposing community-specific plant litter material including lower susceptibility to dry conditions during summer months. Moreover, higher microbial enzymatic diversity at high plant diversity may have caused elevated mass loss of standard litter. Our results indicate that plant diversity loss and summer drought independently impede soil processes. However, soil decomposer communities may be highly adapted to decomposing plant community-specific litter material, even in situations of environmental stress. Results of standard litter mass loss moreover suggest that decomposer communities under diverse plant communities are able to cope with a greater variety of plant inputs possibly making them less responsive to biotic changes.",7,2013,19,9,2795,2803"le Roux, PC; Virtanen, R; Luoto, M",Geomorphological disturbance is necessary for predicting fine-scale species distributions,ECOGRAPHY,Article,"Disturbances related to geomorphological processes are frequent, widespread and often intense at high latitudes and altitudes, affecting the fine-scale distribution of many plant species. While the inclusion of physical disturbances into models of species geographic ranges is widely recommended, no studies have yet tested the utility of field-quantified geomorphological disturbances for terrestrial species distribution modelling. Here we apply generalized additive models and boosted regression trees to examine if the explicit inclusion of terrestrial and fluvial geomorphological variables alters species distribution models for 154 vascular plant, bryophyte and lichen species in north European mountain tundra. The inclusion of these disturbances significantly improved both the explanatory and predictive power of distribution models, with consistent results for all three species groups. Spatial distribution predictions changed considerably for some species after the inclusion of disturbance variables, with fluvial disturbances generating strongly linear features for species influenced by erosion or sediment deposition. As a consequence, models incorporating geomorphological variables produced markedly more refined distribution maps than simpler models. Predictions of species distributions will thus benefit strongly from the inclusion of fine-scale geomorphological variables, particularly in areas of active earth surface processes, enabling more accurate forecasting of future species ranges under changing conditions.",7,2013,36,7,800,808"Niemela, PT; Dingemanse, NJ; Alioravainen, N; Vainikka, A; Kortet, R",Personality pace-of-life hypothesis: testing genetic associations among personality and life history,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,Article,"Over the last few years, animal personality researchers have called for integrative approaches to study behavioral, immunological, and life-historical traits. This is because life history and personality have become implied as part of integrative pace-of-life syndromes. Immune defense is one of the traits that have been suggested to associate with personality traits, such as boldness, mainly because behavioral types may differ in parasite encounter rates. Here, we quantified the narrow-sense heritabilities (h(2) V-A/(V-A V-R)) and genetic (r(A)) and phenotypic (r(P)) correlations between 2 measures of behavior (overall boldness and defreezing, i.e., recovery from disturbance-induced immobility), 1 measure of immune function (encapsulation response), and 2 life-history traits (body mass and maturation time) using the western stutter-trilling cricket, Gryllus integer. All nonbehavioral traits showed strong heritabilities (range: encapsulation response and life-history: h(2) 0.420.84), whereas behaviors were only marginally heritable (h(2) 0.060.11). Boldness and encapsulation were positively associated, and defreezing and body mass were negatively associated phenotypically, whereas only defreezing was positively genetically correlated with encapsulation. However, the lack of significant additive genetic variation in defreezing suggests that the genetic correlation may be an artifact and therefore, that there were only environmentally induced phenotypic correlations between behaviors and other measured traits. Life-history traits and encapsulation were positively phenotypically associated and these associations were mostly genetically underpinned. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that life history is structured in an evolutionarily significant pace-of-life syndrome, but suggest that behavior does not intrinsically integrate with such life-history variation.",7,2013,24,4,935,941"Gunnarsson, G; Elmberg, J; Poysa, H; Nummi, P; Sjoberg, K; Dessborn, L; Arzel, C",Density dependence in ducks: a review of the evidence,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH,Review,"Density dependence (DD) is a central concept in population ecology and in the management of harvested populations. For example, DD underpins the idea of additive versus compensatory mortality and is a tenet in the paradigm of resource limitation and regulation. Yet the prevalence and importance of DD remains disputed in most organisms, including ducks, which are focal in game management, conservation and zoonotic diseases. Based on 154 data entries from 54 studies in the peer-reviewed literature, we here synthesize and evaluate the prevalence of DD in breeding ducks in relation to (1) species and guild (dabbling versus diving ducks), (2) stage in the breeding cycle (nesting, duckling, recruitment) or, alternatively, in terms of population dynamics, (3) study type (descriptive/non-manipulative versus experimental), (4) continent (Europe versus North America), (5) spatial level (wetland, landscape, regional, continental) and (6) biome (tundra, boreal, nemoral, prairie, mediterranean). One conclusion from this review is that it is difficult to find general patterns about the prevalence of DD unless data are broken down to subsets, for example, to stage or spatial level. With respect to stage, DD effects occur at all stages of the breeding cycle. During the nesting and duckling stages, the frequency of cases detecting versus not detecting DD is roughly the same. However, in cases referring to the recruitment stage, i.e. to survival of fledged ducks until 1 year old at the most, DD was the rule, suggesting that DD processes may operate mainly outside the breeding season. Further subdivision of data shows that spatial scale is important to the prevalence of DD in nesting ducks-rare on the wetland level and more common on higher spatial levels. In studies of population dynamics (i.e. based on time series data only), DD was more often found in diving than in dabbling ducks. This corroborates previous suggestions that dabbling ducks largely should be considered as r-selected species, in contrast to more K-selected diving ducks, which start to reproduce at an older age and often breed in more stable wetland environments where resources may be easier to track and populations thus often are closer to carrying capacity. However, the picture of DD in ducks is far from complete, and knowledge gaps for future studies to address include: (a) data from Russia, which holds a large part of the breeding ducks in the Northern hemisphere, (b) experimental studies on more species to separate density-dependent factors from other drivers of population change and to tease apart spatial and temporal interactions in the underlying processes, (c) time series analyses addressing population dynamics, especially from outside North America, (d) studies relating duck numbers to limiting resources, which arguably is the most relevant measure of density, (e) the timing of DD processes in relation to harvest and natural mortality.",7,2013,59,3,305,321"Cabrero, P; Richmond, L; Nitabach, M; Davies, SA; Dow, JAT",A biogenic amine and a neuropeptide act identically: tyramine signals through calcium in Drosophila tubule stellate cells,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,Article,"Insect osmoregulation is subject to highly sophisticated endocrine control.

Drosophila kinin is known to act through intracellular calcium, but the mode of action of tyramine is not known. Here, we used a transgenically encoded GFP::apoaequorin translational fusion, targeted to either principal or stellate cells under GAL4/UAS control, to demonstrate that tyramine indeed acts to raise calcium in stellate, but not principal cells. Furthermore, the EC(50) tyramine concentration for half-maximal activation of the intracellular calcium signal is the same as that calculated from previously published data on tyramine-induced increase in chloride flux. In addition, tyramine signalling to calcium is markedly reduced in mutants of NorpA (a phospholipase C) and itpr, the inositol trisphosphate receptor gene, which we have previously shown to be necessary for Drosophila kinin signalling. Therefore, tyramine and Drosophila kinin signals converge on phospholipase C, and thence on intracellular calcium; and both act to increase chloride shunt conductance by signalling through itpr. To test this model, we co-applied tyramine and Drosophila kinin, and showed that the calcium signals were neither additive nor synergistic.

We model social group dynamics in cooperatively breeding meerkats, Suricata suricatta, paying attention to local demographic as well as dispersal processes. We use generalized additive models to describe the influence of group size, population density, and environmental conditions on demographic rates for each sex and stage, and we combine these models into predictive and individual-based simulation models of group dynamics. Short-term predictions of expected group size and simulated group trajectories over the longer term agree well with observations. Group dynamics are characterized by slow increases during the breeding season and relatively sharp declines during the pre-breeding season, particularly after dry years. We examine the demographic mechanisms responsible for environmental dependence. While individuals appear more prone to emigrate after dry years, seasons of low rainfall also cause reductions in reproductive output that produce adult-biased age distributions in the following dispersal season. Adult subordinates are much more likely to disperse or be evicted than immature individuals, and demographic structure thus contributes to crashes in group size.

On the landscape scale, systems that have undergone shifts of this kind are characterized by sharp forestsavanna boundaries and mosaic-like distributions of savanna and forest. Understanding the locations and the dynamics of such boundaries is a challenge for ecologists and is critical for landscape management and biodiversity conservation. Using a time series of aerial photographs (19552000) and a forest habitat suitability map, we tested the hypothesis that topography and spatial processes, especially those relating to fire spread and seed dispersal, are the main determinants of the spatial distribution of rainforest and savanna in a New Caledonian landscape covering 24 km2. Within the studied landscape, the overall forest coverage decreased by 24% between 1976 and 2000. This was primarily due to the contraction of forests on west-facing slopes, which accounted for about 90% of the total loss. Conversely, the east-facing forests seemed to have contracted extensively prior to the studied period, and were confined to refuges. A habitat suitability index calculated from the landscape's topographical features using generalized additive models accurately predicted both the presence of forests and the probability of forest expansion/contraction. We also provide evidence that spatial processes such as fire spread and seed dispersal limit the expansion and contraction of forests.

Once formed, consumer fronts move through systems as spatially propagating waves, self-reinforced via intense overexploitation and amplified by density-dependent feedbacks. When consumer fronts are spatially restricted, they generate patchiness.

Both local rainfall and overbank flow contribute to water accessible by a plant. Variability in rainfall and hydrological regimes at seasonal and longer time scales exerts strong influences shaping ecosystem structure and function in arid and semi-arid floodplains. Yet there are few studies exploring how the interplay of climatic and hydrologic factors affects the integrity of floodplain ecosystems, especially the intermittently flooded vegetated wetlands. In fact, the importance of hydrological regimes prevailingly dominates the literature on floodplain ecology. Consequently, re-establishing and maintaining hydrological regimes has become the cornerstone underpinning most large scale floodplain conservation and restoration programs. In this study, we quantified the relative contribution of climatic and hydrologic variables to ecosystem functioning in the generalized additive modelling (GAM) framework using indicators derived from time series of MODIS 250 m NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). Results from the ""best fitted"" GAM models reveal that local rainfall has a closer and more important relationship with wetland mean NDVI (a surrogate of system primary productivity) although the co-variability between primary productivity and inflow is significantly positive. On the other hand, inflows play a dominant role in creating and maintaining the spatial heterogeneity represented by standard deviation of wetland NDVI while local rainfall has an opposite effect. Further, different vegetation community types exhibit distinct seasonality patterns in the NDVI-based primary productivity. These results illustrate the complexity of interactions between vegetation type, climate variations, and hydrology in floodplain wetlands. These results also demonstrate the sensitivity of floodplain wetlands to the perturbations in rainfall and temperature regimes, which would be more intense under the projected climate change.

Furthermore, it remains unknown whether sex-specific genetic architectures will constrain responses to climatic selection. We used a paternal half-sibling breeding design to examine whether sex-specific genetic architectures and genetic covariances between traits might constrain evolutionary responses to warming climates in a population of Drosophila melanogaster.

Our results suggest that neither trade-offs, nor sex-specific genetics, will significantly constrain an evolutionary response to climatic warming, at least in this population of D.similar to melanogaster.",7,2012,25,7,1415,1426"Bezirci, G; Akkas, SB; Rinke, K; Yildirim, F; Kalaylioglu, Z; Severcan, F; Beklioglu, M",Impacts of salinity and fish-exuded kairomone on the survival and macromolecular profile of Daphnia pulex,ECOTOXICOLOGY,Article,"Global warming is already causing salinization of freshwater ecosystems located in semi-arid regions, including Turkey. Daphnids, which are important grazers on phytoplankton and a major food source for fish and invertebrates, are sensitive to not only changes in salinity levels, but also presence of predators. In this study, the interactive effect of salinity toxicity (abiotic factor) with predation pressure mimicked by the fish-exuded kairomone (biotic factor) and the effect of salt acclimation on daphnids were investigated. Impacts of these stressors on daphnid survival, life history and molecular profile were observed. The presence of the kairomone antagonistically alters the effect of salinity, as observed from the 24- and 48-h LC50 values and survival results. Molecular findings provided solid evidence to this antagonism at even lower salt concentrations, for which antagonism was not evident with organismal data. Fish predation counterbalances the negative effect of salinity in terms of reserve energy density. Therefore, it is important to investigate multiple stressor effects in ecotoxicological bioassays complemented with molecular techniques. The single effect of increasing salinity resulted in increased mortality, decreased fecundity, and slower somatic growth in Daphnia, despite their acclimation to salinity. This insignificance of acclimation indicates that Daphnia do not have any physiological mechanisms to buffer the adverse effects of salinity, making it a very crucial factor. Salinity-induced reduction in population growth rate of freshwater keystone species Daphnia-despite acclimation-indicates that global warming-induced salinity may cascade through the food web and lead to dramatic environmental consequences in the structure of lake ecosystems.",7,2012,21,2,601,614"Trekels, H; Van de Meutter, F; Stoks, R",Effects of species-specific interactions with predation risk on the relative species sensitivities to a pesticide in water boatmen (Corixidae),OIKOS,Article,"There is increasing concern that synergistic interactions between stressors may result in accelerated biodiversity loss. Yet, the prevalence and magnitude of these interactions remain one of the largest uncertainties in projections of future ecological change. Synergistic interactions between pesticide stress and predation risk are receiving increasing attention because they indicate that standard pesticide tests in the absence of predation risk may underestimate effects that occur under natural conditions. We questioned whether synergisms (or interactions in general), by differently shaping individual species' sensitivities, can modulate species sensitivity rankings (SSRs) in survival and growth rate. Using laboratory and outdoor mesocosm experiments with five species of water boatmen (Hemiptera: Corixidae) we studied mortality and growth rate over seven days of exposure. We evaluated the presence and nature of interactions between the pesticide endosulfan and predation risk and tested to what extent this affected the SSRs to endosulfan. The combined exposure to the pesticide and predation risk resulted in synergistic effects for survival (Sigara lateralis) and growth rate (Sigara iactans) and in an antagonistic effect for growth rate (Hesperocorixa linnaei and female Sigara striata). These results suggest that standard tests may underestimate the pesticide effect in a natural predator environment for some species. While the effects of these interactions on SSRs were not strong and SSRs remained largely similar in the absence and presence of predation risk, some obvious species rank shifts occurred for growth rate which may potentially affect community structure through changed competitive strength. The study of SSRs and their dependency on biotic stressors may provide a simple conceptual and predictive framework to increase our understanding of how stressors like pesticides may differentially affect community structure in the absence and presence of another stressor.",7,2011,120,6,897,905"Ramirez-Valiente, JA; Lorenzo, Z; Soto, A; Valladares, F; Gil, L; Aranda, I",Natural selection on cork oak: allele frequency reveals divergent selection in cork oak populations along a temperature cline,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY,Article,"A recent study of population divergence at neutral markers and adaptive traits in cork oak has observed an association between genetic distances at locus QpZAG46 and genetic distances for leaf size and growth. In that study it was proposed that certain loci could be linked to genes encoding for adaptive traits in cork oak and, thus, could be used in adaptation studies. In order to investigate this hypothesis, here we (1) looked for associations between molecular markers and a set of adaptive traits in cork oak, and (2) explored the effects of the climate on among-population patterns in adaptive traits and molecular markers. For this purpose, we chose 9-year-old plants originating from thirteen populations spanning a broad range of climatic conditions. Plants established in a common garden site were genotyped at six nuclear microsatellites and phenotypically characterized for six functional traits potentially related to plant performance.

The study was based on a grid of survey plots, six plots wide and 24 plots long with the long axis running from a settlement 2.4 km through active and abandoned agricultural plots towards a large area of forest. Each circular survey plot (25 m radius) was assigned to a broad habitat type, ten habitat measures taken, and birds counted for 1 h in each plot. Principal component analysis (PCA) habitat axis 1 described an axis of decreasing forest alteration (larger trees, greater tree densities, fuller canopy) that was positively correlated with distance from the settlement. Bird richness and abundance were highest at intermediate disturbance levels (plots with mid-range axis 1 scores). Proportions of insectivores and frugivores increased with decreasing forest alteration, while proportions of nectarivores decreased. We calculated three measures of habitat heterogeneity by comparing each plot's PCA score to those of eight neighbouring plots (50-110 m away). These measures reflected how different the plot was to its neighbours, how variable the habitat was around the plot, and the degree to which the plot bordered less disturbed forest. We related these measures to plot bird variable scores independently, and to residuals following regressions of bird scores against PCA scores. Heterogeneity measures had no significant influence on abundance or richness measures, but there were greater proportions of frugivores in plots showing a given degree of habitat alteration if they bordered more pristine habitat. While we readily identified differences in bird communities along the agricultural gradient, the influences of habitat heterogeneity were not striking for birds at this fine scale.",7,2008,33,6,784,793"Salvat, B; Aubanel, A; Adjeroud, M; Bouisset, P; Calmet, D; Chancerelle, Y; Cochennec, N; Davies, N; Fougerousse, A; Galzin, R; Lagouy, E; Lo, C; Monier, C; Ponsonnet, C; Remoissenet, G; Schneider, D; Stein, A; Tatarata, M; Villiers, L",Monitoring of French Polynesia coral reefs and their recent development,REVUE D ECOLOGIE-LA TERRE ET LA VIE,Article,"Monitoring of French Polynesia coral reefs and their recent development.-French Polynesia, consisting of 118 islands in the centre of the Pacific Ocean, has more than 15 000 km(2) of reefs and lagoons managed by the local government. Tourism and pearl culture are the two main economic resources of the country. Polynesian coral reefs are extremely diverse and are among those for which we have thorough knowledge. The exploitation of local resources has been recorded for multiple decades and includes : coral materials, fishing, harvest and export of mother-of-pearl molluscs, pearl production, and ornamental fish. All over the country, many monitoring programmes have been launched to measure the health of reefs and the natural and anthropogenic perturbations that they suffer : hurricanes and seismic events, water quality, health of benthic and fish communities, pearl oyster pathology and radiobiology. These data, collected over the last few decades, allowed to define the relative importance of natural and anthropogenic degradation on reefs and lagoons, and to explain the present status of reefs at different spatial scales. Devastating hurricanes are rare (1903-1906, 1982-1983 and occasionally at other times), but they may annihilate outer slope coral communities on some islands. Bleaching events with considerable coral mortality at different geographical scales occurred mainly in 1991, 1994 and 2003. Outbreaks of Acanthaster destroyed numerous reefs (lagoons and outer slopes) from 1978-1982 and a new demographic wave began in 2006 at many Society islands. Eutrophication events only occurred occasionally and only in some lagoons. Whereas natural catastrophic events degrade the coral reef ecosystem across many islands, at the archipelago or even regional scale, anthropogenic degradation is limited to a few Society Islands, occurring rarely on atolls and not at all on those (one third) which are uninhabited. The main causes of reef degradation in some areas of Tahiti and Moorea include the embankment of fringing zones, coral mining, overfishing, absence of urban sewage treatment and the development of leisure and tourism activities. Because of its large geographical extent, one may conclude that major reef degradation in French Polynesia is caused by catastrophic natural events. On the other hand, anthropogenic degradation is more localized. Unfortunately, the synergistic effects of these causes of degradation prevent reefs from recovering. Optimum coral cover on French Polynesian outer reef slopes is between 50-60%. After a major destructive impact (hurricane, bleaching, Acanthaster) a reef is reduced to less than 10% coral cover, however if no more major disturbance events occur a reef will recover in about 12 years. Most of the 15 000 km(2) of reefs and lagoons in French Polynesia are in good health, and along with their neighbouring reefs in East and Central Pacific they are considered as the least degraded reefs worldwide and at a low risk of becoming degraded in the few next decades. However, we are more and more anxious about the future of reefs in the world particularly because present simulations predict that major impacts of climate change would include : elevation of sea surface temperatures, increase in the strength of hurricanes and acidification of seawater which will affect the formation of coral structures.",7,2008,63,02-Jan,145,177"Keller, JM; Allen, DE; Davis, CR; Leamy, LJ","2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin affects fluctuating asymmetry of molar shape in mice, and an epistatic interaction of two genes for molar size",HEREDITY,Article,"Fluctuating asymmetry ( FA), random variation between left and right sides in a bilaterally symmetrical character, is a commonly used measure of developmental instability that is expected to increase with increasing environmental stress. One potential stressor is 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD), a powerful toxicant known to disturb tooth development. In this study, mice in the F-2 generation produced from an intercross between two inbred strains ( C57BL/ 6J and AKR/ J) were exposed in utero to TCDD. We hypothesized that TCDD would increase FA in the molars of exposed mice over that of the control mice. In addition, we hypothesized that we would discover genes for molar size, shape or asymmetry whose expression would be affected by TCDD. We detected a very small, but significant, increase in FA of molar shape ( but not size) in the TCDD-exposed mice compared to the control mice, although molar size and shape did not differ between these groups. Although we did not uncover any genes that acted differently in the TCDD exposed and control groups, we did identify two genes whose dominance by additive epistatic effect on molar size was affected by TCDD. We concluded that although TCDD may be affecting the expression of some genes governing the development of molars in our population of mice, FA of molar size and shape is not a particularly sensitive indicator of this effect.",7,2007,98,5,259,267"Karonen, M; Ossipov, V; Ossipova, S; Kapari, L; Loponen, J; Matsumura, H; Kohno, Y; Mikami, C; Sakai, Y; Izuta, T; Pihlaja, K","Effects of elevated carbon dioxide and ozone on foliar proanthocyanidins in Betula platyphylla, Betula ermanii, and Fagus crenata seedlings",JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY,Article,"Proanthocyanidins (PAs) or condensed tannins are a major group of phenolic compounds in the leaves of birch trees and many other woody and herbaceous plants. These compounds constitute a significant allocation of carbon in leaves and are involved in plant responses to environmental stress factors, such as pathogens or herbivores. In some plants, PA concentrations are affected by atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and ozone (O(3)) levels that may influence, for example, species fitness, community structure, or ecosystem nutrient cycling. Therefore, a study on the quantitative response of PAs to elevated concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and ozone (O(3)) was undertaken in seedlings of Betula platyphylla, Betula ermanii, and Fagus crenata. Seedlings were exposed to ambient or elevated O(3) and CO(2) levels during two growing seasons in the Kanto district in Japan. Ten open-top chambers were used for five different treatments with two replicates: filtered air (FA), ambient air (ambient O(3), 43 ppb; ambient CO(2), 377 ppm), elevated O(3) (1.5 x ambient O(3), 66 ppb), elevated CO(2) (1.5 x ambient CO(2), 544 ppm), and elevated O(3) and CO(2) combined. In addition, seedlings growing in natural conditions outside of chambers were studied. Leaf samples were analyzed for total PA concentrations by butanol-HCl assay and for polymeric PA concentrations by normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Total PA concentrations in leaves of all species were similarly affected by different treatments. They were significantly higher in seedlings treated with elevated CO(2) and O(3) combined, and in seedlings growing outside chambers compared with the FA controls. F. crenata contained only traces of polymeric PAs, but significant species x treatment interaction was observed in the polymeric PA concentrations in B. ermanii and B. platyphylla. In B. platyphylla, leaves treated with elevated CO(2) + O(3) differed significantly from all other treatments. It was suggested that the strongest effect of elevated CO(2) and O(3) combined on leaf PA contents resulted from the additive effect of these environmental factors on phenolic biosynthesis.",7,2006,32,7,1445,1458"Efimov, VM; Kovaleva, VY; Markel, AL",A new approach to the study of genetic variability of complex characters,HEREDITY,Article,"A new approach to multivariate genetic analysis of complex organismal traits is developed.

We focused on 2 species of squirrel (Sciuridae: northern flying squirrel, Glaucomys sabrinus, and Townsend's chipmunk, Tamias townsendii) in a cross-sectional survey of managed and natural stands in southwestern Oregon during 1985-59. We measured vegetation and abundances of squirrels at >2,000 points in 19 stands in 3 seral stages. We described the diets of die squirrels in the stands. We analyzed data at point, stand, and stage scales to identify key processes contributing to biodiversity and scales at which emergent properties (synergistic effects) appeared. Four factors (crown-class differentiation, decadence, canopy stratification, and understory development) accounted for 63% of variance in vegetation structure. Decadence contributed to variation mostly in late-seral forest. Within stands, most habitat variables were poorly correlated. Across stands many variables were highly correlated, suggesting forests developed emergent properties above the point level but at or below stand level (16 ha). Plant species composition was summarized by 21 vegetation site types. Stands had 7-19 site types arrayed in fine scale (point and soups of points 40 m apart). Site types were used to measure habitat habitat breadth (within-stand heterogeneity resulting from disturbance and forest development). Vegetation structure varied on a 0.5-ha scale. Stand-level characteristics were more influential than nominal seral stage for a variety of organisms. Late-seral forests were more moist and complex with greater habitat breadth than 40-70-year managed stands. Structural factors, moisture-temperature gradient values (MGV), and habitat breadth were used to describe the habitat space potentially available to squirrels. Correlations between squirrels and habitat variables within stands were low linear regressions explained <20% of the within-stand variance in squirrel captures, but logistic regressions correctly classified 74 and 88% of the points according to usage (used, not used) by flying squirrels and chipmunks, respectively. Compared to available habitat space, the realized habitat of flying squirrels had high decadence and complex canopies. The realized habitat of chipmunks had complex canopies and large, dominant trees. Overall, chipmunks were less selective than flying squirrels and used 83% of the habitat space compared to 59% by flying squirrels. Among stands, variance in carrying capacity of Eying squirrels Mas Lest explained (70%) by decadence, habitat breadth, and MGV. For chipmunks, decadence and canopy stratification provided the Lest model (72% of variance explained). Both squirrels had mycologically diverse diets; richness was correlated with decadence and canopy stratification. Major dietary fungi were associated with woody debris. Flying squirrels had higher carrying capacities and overlap among foraging patches of individuals, but smaller foraging patches, in late seral forest than in managed stands. Squirrels were more abundant in late seral forest than in managed forests. Abundance in some stands deviated markedly from the stage mean-stand character was more influential than nominal seral stage. The 4 structural factors each represented all important ecological process; decadence and canopy stratification apparently had profound influences on other life forms. Carefully timed variable-density thinnings could accelerate crown-class differentiation, canopy stratification, and understory development and increase habitat breadth. Management of decadence is more problematic and may require various interventions, in eluding inducing decay in live trees, conserving biological legacies from previous stands, and ensuring recruitment of coarse woody debris.",7,1999,,142,5,71"HUANG, LB; MURRAY, F; YANG, XH","INTERACTION BETWEEN MILD NACL SALINITY AND SUBLETHAL SO2 POLLUTION ON WHEAT TRITICUM-AESTIVUM CULTIVAR WILGOYNE (CIANO-GALLO) .1.

The objective was to investigate whether mild salinity stress could decrease the sensitivity of plant growth to sublethal SO2 stress. Exposure to 441 nl l-1 SO2 significantly decreased CO2 stomatal conductance, net photosynthesis rate, and at the end of experiment, chlorophyll concentrations in the youngest fully expanded (YFE) leaves. Inhibition of photosynthesis by 441 nl l-1 SO2 fumigation resulted in a change in assimilate allocation in favour of shoot growth, leading to an increase in shoot to root ratio. Exposure to 441, but not 231 nl l-1 SO2 significantly decreased plant dry weight and relative growth rate (RGR) of both root and shoot. 50 mM NaCl treatment first decreased shoot growth, resulting in a decrease in shoot to root ratio, but later a significant decrease in root growth developed, probably owing to limited assimilate supply from the shoot, and resulted in an increase in shoot to root ratio. There was generally no significant interaction between SO2 fumigation and NaCl salinity on net photosynthesis rate and leaf chlorophyll concentration. However, CO2 stomatal conductance in the YFE leaves of 50 mM NaCl-treated and SO2-fumigated plants recovered more quickly after the completion of fumigation than the non-saline and SO2-fumigated plants. 50 mM NaCl salinity and 441 nl l-1 SO2 fumigation had an antagonistic interaction on both shoot and root dry weight. Exposure to 231 nl l-1 SO2 increased the shoot to root ratio in plants with 50 mM NaCl. No significant interaction between SO2 fumigation and 50 mM NaCl was observed on the RGR of both shoot and root. The results showed that 50 mM NaCl salinity did not provide an effective protection against SO2 uptake in the leaves by increasing stomatal resistance during SO2 fumigation. Other physiological mechanisms could be involved in the antagonistic interaction between 50 mM NaCl salinity and 441 nl l-1 SO2 fumigation on plant growth.",7,1994,48,2,163,178"Bowman, DMJS; Williamson, GJ; Keenan, RJ; Prior, LD",A warmer world will reduce tree growth in evergreen broadleaf forests: evidence from Australian temperate and subtropical eucalypt forests,GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,Article,"Aims Understanding how tree growth is influenced by climate is vital for predicting how forests will respond to climate change, yet there have been few studies of tree growth spanning macroclimatic gradients. The aim of this study is to correlate growth of a single lineage of broadleaf evergreen trees with continental-scale variability in climate. Location Australia's temperate mesic eucalypt forests, spanning latitudes from 23 to 43 degrees S and longitudes from 115 to 153 degrees E. Methods We compiled and analysed a dataset containing around half a million measurements of growth in eucalypt tree diameter, collected from 2409 permanent forestry plots. These plots spanned a range of 558-2105 mm mean annual precipitation and 6-22 degrees C mean annual temperature. Generalized additive models were used to study the relationship between growth in tree diameter and several temperature and water availability variables. Results Tree growth increased with precipitation, but with a diminishing response above a mean annual precipitation of 1400 mm. There was a peaked response to temperature, with maximum growth occurring at a mean annual temperature of 11 degrees C and maximum temperature of the warmest month of 25-27 degrees C. Lower temperatures directly constrain growth. High temperatures primarily reduced growth by reducing water availability, but they also appeared to exert a direct negative effect. Our best model, which included maximum temperature of the warmest month and the ratio of precipitation to evaporation, explained 28% of the deviance. Main conclusions The productivity of Australia's temperate eucalypt forests could decline substantially as the climate warms, given that 87% of these forests currently experience a mean annual temperature above 11 degrees C, where the highest growth rates were observed.

Methods We cross-dated and analysed annually-resolved tree-ring data from 35 tree cross-sections in an old-growth deciduous forest to reconstruct historical fire and canopy disturbance and explore connections among these processes. Canopy disturbance patterns as indicated by tree growth release within this collection [fire history collection: (FHC)] were compared to cores from 26 trees collected in 1983 for the purposes of climate reconstruction [climate collection: (CC)]. Results Initiation dates in the FHC ranged from ca. 1670 to 1925. Thirty-three fire scars were identified from 1678 to 1956. The mean interval between fire events was 9.3yrs, and there were many more fires after 1800 than before that date. Gap dynamics, as reconstructed through growth release detection, were relatively constant through the FHC record and were supported by a similar result in the CC. The mean number of years between detected release events was 5.2yrs. Many individual trees, and the mean growth chronology for the FHC, indicate that many oak trees exhibit growth release after long periods of suppression and, after a final release, exhibit a step-change in growth rate suggesting canopy accession. Conclusions Fire and gap dynamics occurred through much of the last ca. 350yrs in this old-growth forest. There was not evidence to support that these two processes were temporally linked - gap dynamics were ostensibly independent of fire occurrence. Even so, we posit that these two processes may have a synergistic effect on long-term dynamics, wherein fire 'filters' the seedling pool and gap openings provide canopy accession opportunities. We also note several instances where release events are associated with stand-wide growth increases suggesting large-scale canopy accession. These events could influence the overstorey composition of the forest for centuries.",6,2014,17,2,312,322"Alric, B; Jenny, JP; Berthon, V; Arnaud, F; Pignol, C; Reyss, JL; Sabatier, P; Perga, ME",Local forcings affect lake zooplankton vulnerability and response to climate warming,ECOLOGY,Article,"While considerable insights on the ecological consequences of climate change have been gained from studies conducted on remote lakes, little has been done on lakes under direct human exposure. Ecosystem vulnerability and responses to climate warming might yet largely depend on the ecological state and thus on local anthropogenic pressures. We tested this hypothesis through a paleolimnological approach on three temperate large lakes submitted to rather similar climate warming but varying intensities of analogous local forcings (changes in nutrient inputs and fisheries management practices). Changes in the structure of the cladoceran community were considered as revealing for alterations, over the time, of the pelagic food web. Trajectories of the cladoceran communities were compared among the three study lakes (Lakes Geneva, Bourget, and Annecy) over the last 70-150 years. Generalized additive models were used to develop a hierarchical understanding of the respective roles of local stressors and climate warming in structuring cladoceran communities. The cladoceran communities were not equally affected by climate warming between lakes. In Lake Annecy, which is the most nutrient-limited, the cladoceran community was essentially controlled by local stressors, with very limited impact of climate. In contrast, the more nutrient-loaded Lakes Geneva and Bourget were more sensitive to climate warming, although the magnitude of their responses and the pathways under which climate warming affected the communities varied between the two lakes. Finally, our results demonstrated that lake vulnerability and responses to climate warming are modulated by lake trophic status but can also be altered by fisheries management practices through changes in fish predation pressure.",6,2013,94,12,2767,2780"Olano, JM; Almeria, I; Eugenio, M; von Arx, G",Under pressure: how a Mediterranean high-mountain forb coordinates growth and hydraulic xylem anatomy in response to temperature and water constraints,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,Article,"1. Plant growth in Mediterranean high mountains is limited by the double climatic stress of low winter temperatures and summer drought. Elevational shifts in response to climate change may be complex for species whose distribution is constrained by several climatic factors. 2. We used herb-chronology, that is, the analysis of annual rings in the secondary root xylem of perennial forbs, to evaluate life-long factors constraining secondary growth and xylem hydraulic anatomy along an elevational gradient from the upper to the lower distribution limits of the alpine forb Silene ciliata at its southernmost distribution range. 3. Generalized additive models (GAM) showed that annual ring width (RW) in S.ciliata was greatest at intermediate elevations and smallest at the upper and lower limits of its elevational range. In contrast, maximal vessel area (MVA) was greatest at lower elevations. RW responded to climatic conditions in early spring and late summer, suggesting the presence of a bimodal xylogenesis. Structural equation modelling (SEM) indicated a positive influence of MVA on RW in the same year; improved hydraulic efficiency seemed to promote higher secondary growth. 4. The observed greatest secondary growth (RW) and maximal vessel area (MVA) at intermediate and intermediate-low elevations, respectively, contrasts with previous evidence of an improvement in plant reproduction and recruitment with increasing elevation for S.ciliata. However, our results are in agreement with other indicators suggesting that best conditions occur at intermediate elevations, such as better seed quality or larger genome size. 5.

In social insects, compounds on the body surface represent a particularly interesting trait, because they comprise different compound classes that are involved in different functions, such as communication, recognition and protection, all of which can be differentially affected by evolutionary processes. Here, we investigate the widely unknown and possibly antagonistic influence of phylogenetic and environmental factors on the composition of the cuticular chemistry of tropical stingless bees. We chose stingless bees because some species are unique in expressing not only self-produced compounds, but also compounds that are taken up from the environment. By relating the cuticular chemistry of 40 bee species from all over the world to their molecular phylogeny and geographical occurrence, we found that distribution patterns of different groups of compounds were differentially affected by genetic relatedness and biogeography. The ability to acquire environmental compounds was, for example, highly correlated with the bees' phylogeny and predominated in evolutionarily derived species. Owing to the presence of environmentally derived compounds, those species further expressed a higher chemical and thus functional diversity. In Old World species, chemical similarity of both environmentally derived and self-produced compounds was particularly high among sympatric species, even when they were less related to each other than to allopatric species, revealing a strong environmental effect even on largely genetically determined compounds. Thus, our findings do not only reveal an unexpectedly strong influence of the environment on the cuticular chemistry of stingless bees, but also demonstrate that even within one morphological trait (an insect's cuticular profile), different components (compound classes) can be differentially affected by different drivers (relatedness and biogeography), depending on the functional context.",6,2013,280,1762,,"Mcleod, E; Anthony, KRN; Andersson, A; Beeden, R; Golbuu, Y; Kleypas, J; Kroeker, K; Manzello, D; Salm, RV; Schuttenberg, H; Smith, JE",Preparing to manage coral reefs for ocean acidification: lessons from coral bleaching,FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT,Review,"Ocean acidification is a direct consequence of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and is expected to compromise the structure and function of coral reefs within this century.

The potential interactive effects of these different stressors cannot be determined by studying each in isolation, although such synergies have been largely ignored in ecological field studies to date. Here, we use a model system of naturally fragmented islands in a braided river network, which is exposed to periodic inundation, to investigate the interactive effects of habitat isolation and flood disturbance. Food web structure was similar across the islands during periods of hydrological stability, but several key properties were altered in the aftermath of flood disturbance, based on distance of the islands from the regional source pool of species: taxon richness and mean food chain length declined with habitat isolation after flooding, while the proportion of basal species increased. Greater species turnover through time reflected the slower process of re-colonisation on the more distant islands following disturbance. Increased variability of several food web properties over a 1-year period highlighted the reduced temporal stability of isolated habitat fragments. Many of these effects reflected the differential successes of predator and prey species at re-colonising the islands: even though larger, more mobile consumers may reach the more distant islands first, they cannot establish populations until the lower trophic levels have successfully reassembled. These results highlight the susceptibility of fragmented ecosystems to environmental perturbations.",6,2013,48,,225,284"Storkey, J; Brooks, D; Haughton, A; Hawes, C; Smith, BM; Holland, JM",Using functional traits to quantify the value of plant communities to invertebrate ecosystem service providers in arable landscapes,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Article,"1. The loss of farmland biodiversity threatens the sustainability of ecosystem services delivered within agricultural landscapes. The functional trait approach has been successfully used in grassland systems to quantify trade-offs and synergies between services delivered directly by plant communities. Many of the services delivered by arable landscapes, however, depend on invertebrate consumers, and the application of the trait-based approach to these systems depends on quantifying functional relationships between trophic levels. 2. Two data sets of plant and invertebrate communities from a range of annual crops and uncropped land habitats were analysed. The community-weighted means of plant functional traits were calculated for the vegetation samples and used as the explanatory variables in a multivariate analysis of plant species composition across habitats. The constrained axes scores were used in statistical models to explain the variance in associated total invertebrate abundance, phytophagous invertebrates and invertebrate numbers weighted by importance in the diet of farmland bird chicks. 3. The multivariate analysis discriminated between plant communities characterized by ruderal traits (high specific leaf area and early flowering) and those with more competitive traits. More ruderal communities also supported proportionally more invertebrates. The suite of traits included in the analysis explained a greater proportion of the variance in invertebrate abundance between uncropped habitats, as opposed to between annual crops. 4. The overlap between the plant traits that respond to disturbance (functional response traits) and those that affect the abundance of phytophagous invertebrates (functional effect traits) and the diet of farmland birds demonstrates the potential for using common functional metrics to integrate the assessment of an ecosystem service across different habitats particularly on uncropped land where intensity of disturbance is the main environmental driver. 5. Synthesis. The quantification of functional linkages between arable plants and the abundance of their associated invertebrate consumer communities is the first step in extending the trait-based approach to quantify trade-offs and synergies between ecosystem services developed in grassland systems to landscapes dominated by arable crops. However, applying the functional approach to in-crop weed communities and other service providers such as pollinators will require the incorporation of additional response and effect traits.",6,2013,101,1,38,46"Santos, J; Pascual, M; Simoes, P; Fragata, I; Lima, M; Kellen, B; Santos, M; Marques, A; Rose, MR; Matos, M",From nature to the laboratory: the impact of founder effects on adaptation,JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,Article,"Most founding events entail a reduction in population size, which in turn leads to genetic drift effects that can deplete alleles. Besides reducing neutral genetic variability, founder effects can in principle shift additive genetic variance for phenotypes that underlie fitness. This could then lead to different rates of adaptation among populations that have undergone a population size bottleneck as well as an environmental change, even when these populations have a common evolutionary history. Thus, theory suggests that there should be an association between observable genetic variability for both neutral markers and phenotypes related to fitness. Here, we test this scenario by monitoring the early evolutionary dynamics of six laboratory foundations derived from founders taken from the same source natural population of Drosophila subobscura. Each foundation was in turn three-fold replicated. During their first few generations, these six foundations showed an abrupt increase in their genetic differentiation, within and between foundations. The eighteen populations that were monitored also differed in their patterns of phenotypic adaptation according to their immediately ancestral founding sample. Differences in early genetic variability and in effective population size were found to predict differences in the rate of adaptation during the first 21 generations of laboratory evolution. We show that evolution in a novel environment is strongly contingent not only on the initial composition of a newly founded population but also on the stochastic changes that occur during the first generations of colonization.

In this study we estimated the additive and non-additive components of the genetic variability of net reproductive rate (R-0) in a natural Daphnia magna population exposed to Cd stress at two different temperatures. To this end, life-table experiments were conducted with 20 parental and 39 offspring clonal lineages following a 2 x 2 design with Cd concentration (control vs. 3.7 mu g Cd/L) and temperature (20 vs. 24 A degrees C) as factors. Offspring lineages were obtained through inter-clonal crossing of the different parental lineages. The population mean, additive and non-additive genetic components of variation in each treatment were estimated by fitting an Animal Model to the observed R-0 values using restricted maximum likelihood estimation. From those estimates broad-sense heritabilities (H-2), narrow-sense heritabilities (h(2)), total (CVG) and additive genetic coefficients of variation (CVA) of R-0 were calculated. The exposure to Cd imposed a considerable level of stress to the population, as shown by the fact that the population mean of R-0 exposed to Cd was significantly lower than in the control at the corresponding temperature, i.e. by 23 % at 20 A degrees C and by 88 % at 24 A degrees C. The latter difference indicates that increasing temperature increased the stress level imposed by Cd. The HA(2) and CVG were significantly greater than 0 in all treatments, suggesting that there is a considerable degree of genetic determination of R-0 in this population and that clonal selection could rapidly lead to increasing population mean fitness under all investigated conditions. More specifically, the HA(2) was 0.392 at 20 A degrees C+Cd and 0.563 at 24 A degrees C+Cd; the CVG was 30.0 % at 20 A degrees C+Cd and was significantly higher (147.6 %) in the 24 A degrees C+Cd treatment. Significant values of h(2) (= 0.23) and CVA (= 89.7 %) were only found in the 24 A degrees C+Cd treatment, suggesting that the ability to produce more offspring under this stressful condition may be inherited across sexual generations. In contrast, in the less stressful 20 A degrees C+Cd treatment the h(2) (0.06) and CVA (7.0 %) were very low and not significantly higher than zero. Collectively our data indicate that both the asexual and sexual reproduction phases in cyclic parthenogenetic D. magna populations may play a role in the long-term adaptive potential of Daphnia populations to chemical stress (with Cd as the current example) and that environmental variables which influence the stress level of that chemical may influence this adaptive potential (with temperature as current example).",6,2012,21,7,1899,1910"Mackay, AW; Davidson, T; Wolski, P; Woodward, S; Mazebedi, R; Masamba, WRL; Todd, M","Diatom sensitivity to hydrological and nutrient variability in a subtropical, flood-pulse wetland",ECOHYDROLOGY,Article,"The principal aim of this study was to disentangle hydrochemical influences on primary producers in a pristine, flood-pulse ecosystem. This was undertaken by analysing diatoms from 100 sample points from hydrologically distinct regions in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Cluster analysis was undertaken using two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN), and groups used to classify sample points in a principal components analysis (PCA) biplot. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was performed using hydrological data and diatom guilds as explanatory variables. A series of ordinations using redundancy analysis (RDA) was undertaken to assess which variables significantly accounted for diatom variation across the Delta. Species-response curves for major taxa were generated using generalized additive models (GAMs). Cluster analysis revealed six distinct groups. Groups 5 and 6 consisted mainly of seasonally inundated floodplain sites, which lay at one end of a significant gradient revealed by PCA. Floodplain diatoms were characteristically N-heterotrophs, requiring elevated concentrations of key resources such as total nitrogen (TN) and SiO2. Using forward selection, constrained RDA reveals five variables were significant in explaining diatom distributions across the Delta: hydroperiod class, flood frequency, flow velocity and nutrients SiO2 and TN. Species-response curves show that motile diatoms were most abundant in seasonally inundated floodplains. Species diversity was significantly higher in the upper Panhandle region of the Delta, which may be related to moderate levels of disturbance and increased resource limitation. Species diversity was significantly lower during the period of maximum flood extent, which may in turn be related to fewer limiting resources.

We used parentoffspring comparisons to examine the impact of humidity levels on the heritability of a physiological trait, resistance to heat, measured as knockdown time at constant temperature. Drosophila melanogaster were reared under standard nonstressful conditions and heat-shocked as adults at extreme high or low humidity. Mean knockdown time was decreased in the stressful dry environment, but there was a significant sex-by-treatment interaction: at low humidity, females were more heat resistant than males, whereas at high humidity, the situation was reversed. Phenotypic variability of knockdown time was also lower in the dry environment. The magnitude of genetic correlation between the sexes at high humidity indicated genetic variation for sexual dimorphism in heat resistance. Heritability estimates based on one-parentoffspring regressions tended to be higher under desiccation stress, and this could be explained by decreased environmental variance of heat resistance at low humidity. There was no indication that the additive genetic variance and evolvability of heat resistance differed between the environments.

We have observed that conifer seedlings are rarely found growing in meadows but readily establish under adjacent aspen stands, particularly at the base of aspen trees, creating the potential for antagonistic interactions in later life stages. To examine these relationships and their potential consequences on forest community development, we characterized patterns of establishment, regeneration, and overstory mortality of aspen (Populus tremuloides) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) along a stand composition gradient (aspen dominant ! mixed ! conifer dominant) that develops in seral aspen forests. We found strong stand effects on the establishment of both aspen and subalpine fir regeneration. Aspen regenerated into meadows from the forest boundary, reached peak densities underneath aspen stands, and decreased significantly in mixed and conifer dominated stands. In contrast, subalpine fir seedlings failed to regenerate in meadows, but established readily underneath aspen, mixed and conifer stands. Within stands, establishing subalpine fir seedlings were strongly aggregated around mature aspen trees, which increased the proximity of the two species 2-10 fold depending on subalpine fir age class and stand type. Both stand type and increased proximity of overstory aspen and fir trees drove mortality patterns of the two species in opposite directions. Overstory aspen mortality increased sharply along the stand composition gradient: aspen (7%), mixed (17%), conifer (49%), while subalpine fir wasn't significantly influenced by stand type. Proximity of overstory aspen and subalpine fir, was associated with increased (23) aspen mortality under all stand conditions but increased subalpine fir survival resulting in high aspen: fir mortality ratios that likely accelerate successional shifts toward conifer dominance. Our data suggest that environmental conditions that promote facilitator mortality may compromise the ability of facilitation-dependent forests to regenerate following disturbance.

Transplant studies indicate that areas just across range boundaries are often stressful. The recent Defense constraint (DC) hypothesis for plants states that the evolution of tolerance to stressful environments across a range boundary is constrained by allocation to chemical defense because of antagonistic crosstalk between abiotic and biotic stress signaling pathways that otherwise could be co-opted for range expansion. Abscisic acid (ABA) drought stress tolerance and jasmonic acid/ethylene (JA/ET) defense signaling pathways, for example, are known to be antagonistic to one another in Arabidopsis and other species. To test the DC hypothesis, we examined quantitative genetic variation and co-variation among marker-inferred inbred lines and sib-families of Boechera stricta, a close wild relative of Arabidopsis. The dynamics of the defense-stress tolerance tradeoff was examined across 1) years that differed in precipitation, 2) drought and ABA treatments, and 3) a NPK nutrient supply gradient. In support of the DC hypothesis, we observed the tradeoff a) in the dry year, and b) in response to water deficiency, which c) was affected by ABA treatments, but the interaction between ABA and glucosinolate (GS) toxin levels was not significant. In contrast to the effects of water deficiency, d) the effect of lower NPK supply to cause the tradeoff was only marginally significant. Because an ABA-mediated stress response is intrinsic to water deficient conditions and because of the known involvement of JA/ET in GS regulation, we suggest that these results provide circumstantial evidence implicating both of these pathways in the tradeoff and thus in the development of range limits.",6,2012,121,5,790,800"Smyser, TJ; Johnson, SA; Page, LK; Rhodes, OE",Synergistic stressors and the dilemma of conservation in a multivariate world: a case study in Allegheny woodrats,ANIMAL CONSERVATION,Article,"Contemporary patterns of species decline frequently stem from multiple, synergistic pressures, which much like the genetic concept of lethal equivalents, must be interpreted in sum rather than as independent deleterious entities. For example, the recent, range-wide decline of the Allegheny woodrat (Neotoma magister) is likely a result of numerous, minor, human-mediated stressors including habitat fragmentation and disruption of metapopulation dynamics, reduced hard mast availability associated with the functional extirpation of American chestnut (Castanea dentata) and recent shifts in forest composition, and expansion of a human-adapted species, the raccoon (Procyon lotor) and the parasites it carries (Baylisascaris procyonis). To evaluate the assertion that range-wide woodrat declines have been caused by a concatenate of stressors, we used principal component (PC) analysis to identify latent relationships among a suite of biological and ecological factors (reflecting those stressors listed above) and evaluated PC scores relative to the three conservation states of woodrat populations in Indiana (stable, diminished and extirpated). Populations of differing conservation states segregated along each of the three retained PCs, providing support for the assertion that a combination of stressors has contributed to the range-wide decline of woodrat metapopulations, although intriguingly, independent stressors appeared to cause the decline of individual populations. These results suggest specific, minimal site attributes must be met for each of the habitat attributes evaluated to support stable woodrat populations. Our findings further suggest that variation in relative pressures exerted by individual stressors across populations will require site-specific management actions if woodrat populations are to be recovered throughout their range.

Recent work suggests that carotenoids may have synergistic effects in combination with non-pigmentary antioxidants (e.g. vitamin E) on the expression of sexually selected traits in adulthood. However, these studies involved the supplementation of antioxidants to adults so did not take account of early life-history effects. 2. Here, we test the independent and combined roles of supplementation of carotenoids and vitamin E during early growth in regulating the expression of traits in adulthood, in ring-necked pheasants, Phasianus colchicus. Individuals supplemented with a combination of carotenoids and vitamin E were larger at adulthood than individuals receiving other treatment diets (including vitamin E or carotenoids alone), but there were no differences in ornament expression, immune function, the swelling response to phytohaemagglutinin or levels of oxidative damage. 3.

Field observations indicated C. retrofasciata preferentially occupied larger S. hystrix colonies, but among occupied corals, group size was greatest on colonies of an intermediate size and with wider branch spacing. Healthy corals were observed to support higher abundances. The effects of both coral health (live vs. dead) and coral complexity (fine, medium and coarse branching) on survivorship of stocked juvenile C. retrofasciata were examined in a patch reef experiment. Survival was 20% higher in living colonies compared to dead ones, and fish in medium complexity coral exhibited approximately 10 and 20% greater survival than those in both the low and high complexity categories, respectively. These factors had an additive effect with the highest survival observed on healthy colonies with intermediate complexity (95%) and the lowest on highly complex, dead corals (55%). Body size distributions were also reduced on corals with the narrowest branch spacing. During habitat selection trials, juveniles were observed to preferentially occupy colonies with intermediate branch spacing.

However, the conditions under which restoration of degraded tropical dry forests (TDF) might be achieved in practice have not been determined in detail. In this study, we used LANDIS-II, a spatially explicit model of forest dynamics, to assess the potential for passive restoration of TDF through natural regeneration. The model was applied to two Mexican landscapes under six different disturbance regimes, focusing on the impact of fire and cattle grazing on forest cover, structure and composition. Model results identified two main findings. First, tropical dry forests are more resilient to anthropogenic disturbance than expected. Results suggested that under both a scenario of small, infrequent fires and a scenario of large, frequent fires, forest area can increase relatively rapidly. However, forest structure and composition differed markedly between these scenarios. After 400 years, the landscape becomes increasingly occupied by relatively shade-tolerant species under small, infrequent fires, but only species with both relatively high shade tolerance and high fire tolerance can thrive under conditions with large, frequent fires. Second, we demonstrated that different forms of disturbance can interact in unexpected ways. Our projections revealed that when grazing acts in combination with fire, forest cover, structure and composition vary dramatically depending on the frequency and extent of the fires. Results indicated that grazing and fire have a synergistic effect causing a reduction in forest cover greater than the sum of their individual effects. This suggests that passive landscape-scale restoration of TDF is achievable in both Mexican study areas only if grazing is reduced, and fires are carefully managed to reduce their frequency and intensity.

The experiments were conducted for 3 size-classes of the common reef fish Haemulon flavolineatum, a species that shows multiple habitat shifts throughout its ontogeny. We tested the hypothesis that, due to the additive effects of schooling and structure in providing suitable refuge, fish would be more attracted to a microhabitat with conspecifics or heterospecifics than to a microhabitat or conspecifics alone. In the habitat-only experiment, early juveniles (< 3 cm fork length) showed no preference for any microhabitat structures, whereas larger fish preferred complex mangrove structure to seagrass, rubble, or coral. In the second experiment, which offered various combinations of habitat, including habitat with both conspecifics and heterospecifics, the preference for mangrove structure was completely replaced by attraction to conspecifics for all size-classes. Unexpectedly, the combination of conspecifics and habitat structure showed no additive effect. The results demonstrate that although H. flavolineatum makes multiple shifts in habitat throughout its life cycle, in the absence of other biological or environmental drivers preference for shelter habitat past the early post-settlement stage remains the same.

By evaluating each disturbance type (natural and human) alone and then together, I explicitly consider the importance of incorporating realistic environmental variability into population projection models. The model population was most strongly affected by moderate habitat loss, which yielded the highest probability of crossing the risk thresholds over the 60 year time period, although these probabilities were relatively low (<= 0.31). However, the likelihood of crossing the risk thresholds were two to five times as high when human-mediated and natural disturbances were considered together. When these probabilities were calculated per year of the simulation, the results suggested that even relatively mild human disturbances, when considered in conjunction with realistic natural disturbance, resulted in a high probability (> 0.50) of substantial declines within decades.

These studies will help to lest specific predictions about the relative importance of genetic variance and gene flow in limiting current borders and also help in predicting the impact of future environmental changes on distribution shifts.",6,2006,52,04-Mar,247,261"Sera, B; Falta, V; Cudlin, P; Chmelikova, E",Contribution to knowledge of natural growth and development of mountain Norway spruce seedlings,EKOLOGIA-BRATISLAVA,Article,"Influence of the climatic and pollution stress, soil substrates, mosses and dominant herb species on the Norway spruce (Picea abies L. K a r s t.) seedling development and their cohort growth was investigated in six permanent research plots in the Krkonosc Mts from 1995 to 1997. The results showed dependence of seedling development on the synergic influence of the multiple stress. The highest number of seedling cohorts was observed in the least damaged plots (the Modry dul and the Sluncene udoli plots), where climatic conditions are not so severe, the canopy cover is high and consequently litter coverage is high, too. On the contrary, no seedlings were found in the heavily damaged Mumlavska hora plot and only a few seedlings were observed in the Alzbetinka plot (the north exposition and also relatively high polluted plot). One of the important secondary stress factors is an expansive growth of some dominant plants species. The majority of seedlings was germinating and growing in patches covered by litter.

The ecological concept of r- and K-selection is formulated in terms of selection gradients on underlying phenotypic characters that influence the density-dependent measure of fitness. Hence the selection gradients on traits are decomposed into two components, one that changes in the direction to increase r, and one that changes in the direction to increase K. The relative importance of the two components is determined by temporal fluctuations in population density. The evolutionary rate of r and K (per-generation changes in r and K due to the genetic responses of the underlying traits) is also formulated. Numerical simulation has shown that with moderate genetic variances of the underlying characters, r and K can evolve rapidly and the evolutionary rate is influenced by synergistic interaction between characters that contribute to r and K. But strong r-selection can occur only with severe and continuous disturbances of populations so that the population density is kept low enough to prevent K-selection.",6,1996,50,5,1775,1785"TREPL, L",COMPETITION AND COEXISTENCE - ON THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND IN ECOLOGY AND THE INFLUENCE OF ECONOMY AND SOCIAL-SCIENCES,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,Article; Proceedings Paper,"Competition plays an important role in a large number of ecological models. The paper discusses historial aspects of this concept in ecology with respect to the influence of the social background. Competition became a concept of a priori necessity in modern thinking, when life was not longer conceived teleologically. The biological sciences therefore are unthinkable without the idea of competition - but not for empirical reasons. Competition became the basic principle of social life for liberal and democratic, progressive social theories and ideologies. For conservative theories it is the cooperative coexistence, respectively the adaptation within the framework of a social whole, which is thought to be in accordance with the model of the living organism. Theory dynamics in biology can be understood to be parallel to this pattern: On the one hand, the idea of the biological community as an accumulation of individuals emerges with the Darwinian theory of evolution. Here individuals primarily have an antagonistic, competitive relationship with each other. But in early ecology (different from evolutionary biology) the community was not conceived primarily in terms of competition, but in terms of adaptation and interrelated mutual dependence. Thus, ''progressive'' evolutionary theory is opposed to ''conservative'' ecology. In ecology, this inner splitting. appears again: The organismic, holistic, ecosystem-oriented concepts are opposed by individualistic, population-oriented ones. However, usually approaches based on the integration level of populations start out stressing the role of competition and lead to theories of deterministic successions ending in a state of equilibrium and complete mutual adaptation of the components, just like the early organismic theories (''monoclimax''). The recent criticism of the competition concept in ecology may be understood as a part of the general tendency against teleology. The discussion about competition and coexistence provides an example how the social background and ecological theory dynamics relate.",6,1994,75,,99,110"KASULE, FK",QUANTITATIVE VARIATION IN ADULT SIZE AND FECUNDITY OF THE COTTON STAINER BUG DYSDERCUS-FASCIATUS,HEREDITY,Article,"Genetic variation in adult size and fecundity was studied in the cotton stainer bug Dysdercus fasciatus in the laboratory using a split-family, two-environment, half-sib, full-sib design. Groups of siblings were grown in either a benign or a stressful moisture environment. Sib analysis in each environment revealed additive genetic variance for adult size and fecundity only in the benign environment. Heritability estimates were zero for adult size and low for fecundity when averaged over the two environments. A substantial component of the phenotypic variance in adult size and fecundity was due to genotype-by-environment interaction.

In addition, genetic relationships were explored between the character states in different environments. There was a positive and significant genetic association between fecundity and adult size in a benign environment. By contrast, the observed phenotypic covariability of fecundity with adult size in a stressful environment arose entirely from non-additive genetic plus maternal effects.

We approached this distribution using a power-law distribution, which derives from self-organized criticality theory (SOC). We compute the global spatial variation in the power-law exponent and determine the main factors that explain its spatial distribution. LocationGlobal, at 2 degrees grid resolution. MethodsWe use satellite-derived MODIS burned-area data (MCD45) to obtain global individual fire size data for 2002-2010, grouped together for each 2 degrees grid. A global map of fire size distribution was produced by plotting the exponent of the power law. The drivers of the spatial trends in fire size distribution, including vegetation productivity, precipitation, population density and net income, were analysed using a generalized additive model (GAM). ResultsThe power law gave a good fit for 93% of the global 2 degrees grid cells with important fire activity. A global map of the fire size distribution, as approached by the power law shows strong spatial patterns. These are associated both with climatic variables (precipitation and evapotranspiration) and with anthropogenic variables (cropland cover and population density). Main conclusionsOur results indicate that the global fire size distribution changes over gradients of precipitation and aridity, and that it is strongly influenced by human activity. This information is essential for understanding potential changes in fire sizes as a result of climate change and socioeconomic dynamics.

However, despite a surge in conceptual and practical interest, identifying refugia remains a significant challenge across diverse continental landscapes. We provide an overview of the key properties of refugia that promote species' persistence under climate change, including their capacity to (i) buffer species from climate change; (ii) sustain long-term population viability and evolutionary processes; (iii) minimize the potential for deleterious species interactions, provided that the refugia are (iv) available and accessible to species under threat. Further, we classify refugia in terms of the environmental and biotic stressors that they provide protection from (i.e. thermal, hydric, cyclonic, pyric and biotic refugia), but ideally refugia should provide protection from a multitude of stressors. Our systematic characterization of refugia facilitates the identification of refugia in the Australian landscape. Challenges remain, however, specifically with respect to how to assess the quality of refugia at the level of individual species and whole species assemblages. It is essential that these challenges are overcome before refugia can live up to their acclaim as useful targets for conservation and management in the context of climate change.",5,2014,39,8,887,897"Leal, IR; Wirth, R; Tabarelli, M",The Multiple Impacts of Leaf-Cutting Ants and Their Novel Ecological Role in Human-Modified Neotropical Forests,BIOTROPICA,Review,"Herbivory has been identified as a potent evolutionary force, but its ecological impacts have been frequently underestimated. Leaf-cutting ants represent one of the most important herbivores of the Neotropics and offer an interesting opportunity to address the role played by herbivorous insects through a perspective that embraces population- to ecosystem-level effects. Here we: (1) qualitatively summarize the multiple ways leaf-cutting ants interact with food plants and their habitats and elucidate the ultimate outcome of such interactions at multiple organization levels; (2) update our understanding of leaf-cutting ant-promoted disturbance regimes; and (3) examine potential ecological roles by leaf-cutting ants within the context of human-modified landscapes to guide future research agendas. First, we find that leaf-cutting ants show that some herbivorous insects are able to generate ecologically important disturbance regimes via non-trophic activities. Second, impacts of leaf-cutting ants can be observed at multiple spatio-temporal scales and levels of biological organization. Third, ecosystem-level effects from leaf-cutting ants are ecosystem engineering capable not only of altering the abundance of other organisms, but also the successional trajectory of vegetation. Finally, effects of leaf-cutting ants are context-dependent, species-specific, and synergistically modulated by anthropogenic interferences. Future research should examine how leaf-cutting ants respond to deforestation and influence remaining vegetation in human-modified landscapes.

These changes may have important consequences for the physiological performance of early life-history stages of marine organisms. In this study we investigated the potential for interactive effects of ecologically relevant levels of temperature and pCO(2) on germination, dormancy and mortality of zoospores of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, a foundation species of temperate reef ecosystems. Newly settled kelp spores were cultured in the laboratory for seven days in a factorial design with temperature (13 degrees C and 18 degrees C) and pCO(2) (similar to 370 and similar to 1800 mu atm) as experimental factors. The two levels of temperature and the low-pCO(2) treatment in our design were consistent with present-day environmental conditions in the kelp forest as measured by autonomous temperature and pH sensors, while the high-pCO(2) treatment reflects an extreme, future acidification scenario. Our results revealed that the combined effects of increased temperature and pCO(2) can significantly decrease germination rates and increase the mortality of kelp spores. Interactive effects of temperature and pCO(2) were detected,on spore mortality and dormancy. Spore mortality only differed between pCO(2) treatments at high temperature. In contrast, spore dormancy was higher in the treatment with low temperature and high pCO(2), which is similar to the environmental conditions experienced during upwelling events in southern California. Our results highlight the importance of considering multiple stressors to understand how the early-stages of foundation species such as M pyrifera will be affected by global change.

However, efforts to model the impact of climate change on fish growth have been hampered by a lack of long-term (multidecadal) data needed to understand the effects of temperature on growth rates in natural environments. We used a combination of dendrochronology techniques and additive mixed-effects modeling to examine the sensitivity of growth in a long-lived (up to 70 years), endemic marine fish, the western blue groper (Achoerodus gouldii), to changes in water temperature. A multi-decadal biochronology (1952-2003) of growth was constructed from the otoliths of 56 fish collected off the southwestern coast of Western Australia, and we tested for correlations between the mean index chronology and a range of potential environmental drivers. The chronology was significantly correlated with sea surface temperature in the region, but common variance among individuals was low. This suggests that this species has been relatively insensitive to past variations in climate. Growth increment and age data were also used in an additive mixed model to predict otolith growth and body size later this century. Although growth was relatively insensitive to changes in temperature, the model results suggested that a fish aged 20 in 2099 would have an otolith about 10% larger and a body size about 5% larger than a fish aged 20 in 1977. Our study shows that species or populations regarded as relatively insensitive to climate change could still undergo significant changes in growth rate and body size that are likely to have important effects on the productivity and yield of fisheries.",5,2014,20,8,2450,2458"Orsenigo, S; Mondoni, A; Rossi, G; Abeli, T","Some like it hot and some like it cold, but not too much: plant responses to climate extremes",PLANT ECOLOGY,Article,"Current climatic models predict increasing frequency and magnitude of extreme climatic events (ECEs). Ecological studies recognize the importance of these extremes as drivers of plant growth and mortality, as well as drivers of ecological and evolutionary processes. Here we review observational and experimental studies on ECEs on herbaceous plants and shrubs. Extreme events considered were heat waves, drought, advanced or delayed snowmelt, heavy rainfalls, frosts, pulsed watering and flooding. We analysed 39 studies dealing with direct response of plant to ECEs in different ecosystems, with a particular focus on cold ecosystems (alpine and arctic). Although the number of studies increases every year, the understanding of ecological consequences of ECEs is fragmentary. In general, ECEs affected negatively on physiological processes (efficiency of photosystem II, stomatal conductance and leaf water potential), productivity and reproduction, and had consequences on population demography and recruitment several years after ECE. Indeed, the plant responses to ECEs were species specific and depended on the plant life stage and the timing of ECE. In fact, the magnitude of the effect of ECEs decreased over the growing season. Drought had the most severe effect on plants, while heat waves had minor effect if water was available. The overlap of different ECEs had an additive effect (e.g. drought associated to heat-waves). In general, both neutral or positive plant responses were found and acclimation is possible.

Grasslands cover similar to 30% of the Earth's terrestrial surface and provide many ecosystem services. Many grasslands are heavily managed to maximize these services for human benefit, but the outcome of management is anticipated to be increasingly influenced by various aspects of climate change and elevated atmospheric CO2. The relative importance of global change vs. land management on grasslands is largely unknown. 2. A meta-analysis is used here to examine drivers at both scales primarily targeting services provided by grasslands relating to plant productivity (above- and below-ground biomass) and soil processes (nutrients and soil respiration) in 38 manipulative experiments published in the last decade. We specifically target effects of (i) single and combined land management practices (LMs), (ii) single and combined factors relating to broad-scale climate change and elevated CO2, and (iii) combined management practices and changes to climate and CO2. Collectively, this examines the general efficacy of global change models in predicting changes to grassland functioning. 3. We found that combinations of management practices had approximately double the explanatory power for variation in grassland services compared with individual or interactive effects of factors associated with climate change and CO2. These interacting management practices such as nutrient additions and defoliation predominantly influenced functions associated with productivity or biomass both below and above ground. The effects of interacting factors of climate and CO2 influenced a wider range of ecosystem functions, but the magnitude of these effects was relatively smaller. 4. Interactions between management practices or between climate change/CO2 factors always had higher explanatory power than any factor in isolation indicating that multivariate synergistic models of environmental change can better describe impacts on ecosystem function in plant communities (e.g. relative to univariate climate-based models). Given that the magnitude and direction (positive or negative) of the interactions varied widely, this also implies that the outcomes of these multivariate interactions can vary spatially, temporally or by immediate context (e.g. management prescriptions). 5. Synthesis. Although our work confirms how climate change and CO2 can affect many ecosystem-based functional attributes, it suggests that combinations of LMs remain the dominant set of factors in determining the performance of grassland plant communities. Land management may thus be critical for influencing projected responses to future climate change and elevated CO2 in models of grassland function at least for factors relating to primary production.",5,2014,102,4,896,904"Grimaldi, M; Oszwald, J; Doledec, S; Hurtado, MD; Miranda, ID; de Sartre, XA; de Assis, WS; Castaneda, E; Desjardins, T; Dubs, F; Guevara, E; Gond, V; Lima, TTS; Marichal, R; Michelotti, F; Mitja, D; Noronha, NC; Oliveira, MND; Ramirez, B; Rodriguez, G; Sarrazin, M; da Silva, ML; Costa, LGS; de Souza, SL; Veiga, I; Velasquez, E; Lavelle, P",Ecosystem services of regulation and support in Amazonian pioneer fronts: searching for landscape drivers,LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,Article,"Landscape dynamics result from forestry and farming practices, both of which are expected to have diverse impacts on ecosystem services (ES). In this study, we investigated this general statement for regulating and supporting services via an assessment of ecosystem functions: climate regulation via carbon sequestration in soil and plant biomass, water cycle and soil erosion regulation via water infiltration in soil, and support for primary production via soil chemical quality and water storage. We tested the hypothesis that patterns of land-cover composition and structure significantly alter ES metrics at two different scales. We surveyed 54 farms in two Amazonian regions of Brazil and Colombia and assessed land-cover composition and structure from remote sensing data (farm scale) from 1990 to 2007. Simple and well-established methods were used to characterize soil and vegetation from five points in each farm (plot scale). Most ES metrics were significantly correlated with land-use (plot scale) and land-cover (farm scale) classifications; however, spatial variability in inherent soil properties, alone or in interaction with land-use or land-cover changes, contributed greatly to variability in ES metrics. Carbon stock in above-ground plant biomass and water infiltration rate decreased from forest to pasture land covers, whereas soil chemical quality and plant-available water storage capacity increased. Land-cover classifications based on structure metrics explained significantly less ES metric variation than those based on composition metrics. Land-cover composition dynamics explained 45 % (P < 0.001) of ES metric variance, 15 % by itself and 30 % in interaction with inherent soil properties.

We assessed the ability of leading modes of climate variability [Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), Arctic Oscillation (AO), Pacific-North American Pattern (PNA), North Pacific Index (NPI), El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)] to explain decadal-scale (1965-2008) patterns of climatic and biological variability across two North Pacific ecosystems (Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea). Our response variables were the first principle component (PC1) of four regional climate parameters [sea surface temperature (SST), sea level pressure (SLP), freshwater input, ice cover], and PCs 1-2 of 36 biological time series [production or abundance for populations of salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), groundfish, herring (Clupea pallasii), shrimp, and jellyfish]. We found that the climate modes alone could not explain ecological variability in the study region. Both linear models (for climate PC1) and generalized additive models (for biology PC1-2) invoking only the climate modes produced residuals with significant temporal trends, indicating that the models failed to capture coherent patterns of ecological variability. However, when the residual climate trend and a time series of commercial fishery catches were used as additional candidate variables, resulting models of biology PC1-2 satisfied assumptions of independent residuals and out-performed models constructed from the climate modes alone in terms of predictive power. As measured by effect size and Akaike weights, the residual climate trend was the most important variable for explaining biology PC1 variability, and commercial catch the most important variable for biology PC2. Patterns of climate sensitivity and exploitation history for taxa strongly associated with biology PC1-2 suggest plausible mechanistic explanations for these modeling results.

However, the extent to which surface mining interacts with other landuse stressors (i.e., cumulative effects) is unclear, and this limits our ability to predict the effects of new mines on physical, chemical, and biological conditions downstream. We tested for additive and interactive effects of landuse change (surface mining, deep mining, and residential development) on water quality (specific conductance and Se), habitat quality, and benthic macroinvertebrates via a uniquely designed watershed-scale assessment of the Coal River, West Virginia (USA). We derived equations for predicting in-stream response to landscape changes and predicted the outcome of a realistic future scenario involving development of 15 permitted mines. Elevated Se concentrations were directly correlated with incremental increases in surface-mining extent. Surface mining, deep mining, and residential development had additive effects on elevated specific conductance and reduced biological condition. We found evidence of a positive interactive effect (stressor antagonism) of deep mining and residential development on biological condition, presumably caused by stream-flow augmentation from deep mines. Landscape context influenced predicted impacts from construction of 15 new mines because of additive and interactive effects of landuse change. New surface mines increased the number of receiving streams exceeding chemical and biological criteria, but a greater proportion of receiving streams exceeded chemical and biological criteria at equivalent levels of new mine development when pre-existing stressors were present.

MethodsWe visited 50 30mx30m randomly sampled plots in 2011 and 2012. A Procrustes analysis of two non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordinations provided information on the temporal change of species assemblages. Variation partitioning revealed the differences in explanatory power of the predictors. We employed a generalized additive model (GAM) to fit the scores of the first ordination axis with a floristic gradient map as a result. ResultsGenerally, higher rainfall resulted in a positive feedback when considering biodiversity, productivity and vegetation assemblages. The floristic gradient map resulting from the GAM displayed the spatial distribution of the three main assemblages along the climatic gradient. Edaphic variables added no independent portion to the explanation of the vegetation assemblages, but explained in conjunction with topography and NDVI a considerable amount of the variance.

However, in many cases, food-web and habitat complexity also change with abiotic stress or disturbance, potentially altering patterns of species interactions across environmental gradients. We used a combination of field assays and mesocosm experiments to investigate how disturbance from desiccation moderates top-down control of prey by predators across a gradient of pond duration in New Zealand. Field manipulations of predator abundance in ponds led to an unexpected decrease in the top-down control of prey biomass by predatory invertebrates as pond duration increased (decreasing abiotic stress). Predatory fish, which are restricted to permanent ponds, had negligible effects on prey biomass. Mesocosm experiments further indicated the consumptive effects of fish are weak; a result that cannot be explained by an increase in physical habitat refugia in relatively more permanent ponds. Manipulations of invertebrate predator diversity in mesocosms (both substitutive and additive treatments), and the addition of olfactory fish cues, revealed that strong non-consumptive effects of fish reduced predation by predatory invertebrates, and these effects overwhelmed the positive influence of invertebrate predator diversity on prey consumption. These results suggest that decreases in top-down control with increasing pond permanence are likely a result of non-consumptive effects of fish weakening predation by invertebrate predators in the more complex food webs of permanent ponds.

However, the converse is that generation of natural events (such as hurricanes, severe storms and tsunamis) can have devastating impacts on coastal populations, while pollution of the seas by pathogens and toxic waste can cause illness and death in humans and animals. Harmful effects from biogenic toxins produced by algal blooms (HABs) and from the pathogens associated with microbial pollution are also a health hazard in seafood and from direct contact with water. The overall global burden of human disease caused by sewage pollution of coastal waters has been estimated at 4 million lost person-years annually. Finally, the impacts of all of these issues will be exacerbated by climate change. A holistic systems approach is needed. It must consider whole ecosystems, and their sustainability, such as integrated coastal zone management, is necessary to address the highly interconnected scientific challenges of increased human population pressure, pollution and over-exploitation of food (and other) resources as drivers of adverse ecological, social and economic impacts. There is also an urgent and critical requirement for effective and integrated public health solutions to be developed through the formulation of politically and environmentally meaningful policies. The research community required to address ""Oceans & Human Health"" in Europe is currently very fragmented, and recognition by policy makers of some of the problems, outlined in the list of challenges above, is limited. Nevertheless, relevant key policy issues for governments worldwide include the reduction of the burden of disease (including the early detection of emerging pathogens and other threats) and improving the quality of the global environment. Failure to effectively address these issues will impact adversely on efforts to alleviate poverty, sustain the availability of environmental goods and services and improve health and social and economic stability; and thus, will impinge on many policy decisions, both nationally and internationally. Knowledge exchange (KE) will be a key element of any ensuing research. KE will facilitate the integration of biological, medical, epidemiological, social and economic disciplines, as well as the emergence of synergies between seemingly unconnected areas of science and socio-economic issues, and will help to leverage knowledge transfer across the European Union (EU) and beyond.

In turn, seaweed biodiversity patterns are the result of many ecological factors. We determined the influences of thermal and desiccation stress, herbivory, and nutrients on seaweed biodiversity on a northern California rocky shoreline. In a fully crossed design at two tidal heights at wave-protected and exposed sites, we deployed screens to reduce stress, removed herbivores, and added nutrients for 18 months. The treatments reduced temperature, increased relative humidity, decreased herbivore abundances, and increased nitrogen in both seawater and seaweeds. Seaweed abundance and biodiversity (cover, biomass, species richness, diversity, evenness, and community composition) were influenced by tidal height, physical stress, and herbivores. Wave exposure affected all response variables except biomass and evenness. Stress and herbivores had independent additive effects on seaweed abundance and diversity. Physical stress did not make the community as a whole more susceptible to herbivores, and screens had overarching positive effects on seaweed biodiversity even though they also had positive effects on herbivore abundance. Nutrients had virtually no effect on seaweed biodiversity, and we observed no bottom-up effects of nutrient addition on herbivore density or biomass. Small green algae and diatoms were important contributors to overall algal cover and to changes in composition across treatments, but larger macroalgae dominated the species richness response. The striking absence of interactions between stress and herbivory highlights how seaweed communities can respond independently to important drivers of biodiversity. Thus, nonadditive, potentially synergistic effects do not necessarily complicate the understanding of how seaweed biodiversity responds to environmental change.",5,2013,94,5,1102,1111"Pompini, M; Clark, ES; Wedekind, C",Pathogen-induced hatching and population-specific life-history response to waterborne cues in brown trout (Salmo trutta),BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,Article,"Hatching is an important niche shift, and embryos in a wide range of taxa can either accelerate or delay this life-history switch in order to avoid stage-specific risks. Such behavior can occur in response to stress itself and to chemical cues that allow anticipation of stress. We studied the genetic organization of this phenotypic plasticity and tested whether there are differences among populations and across environments in order to learn more about the evolutionary potential of stress-induced hatching. As a study species, we chose the brown trout (Salmo trutta; Salmonidae). Gametes were collected from five natural populations (within one river network) and used for full-factorial in vitro fertilizations. The resulting embryos were either directly infected with Pseudomonas fluorescens or were exposed to waterborne cues from P. fluorescens-infected conspecifics. We found that direct inoculation with P. fluorescens increased embryonic mortality and induced hatching in all host populations. Exposure to waterborne cues revealed population-specific responses. We found significant additive genetic variation for hatching time, and genetic variation in trait plasticity. In conclusion, hatching is induced in response to infection and can be affected by waterborne cues of infection, but populations and families differ in their reaction to the latter.",5,2013,67,4,649,656"Buchheister, A; Bonzek, CF; Gartland, J; Latour, RJ",Patterns and drivers of the demersal fish community of Chesapeake Bay,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,Article,"Large-scale research on the environmental, biological, and anthropogenic drivers of fish distributions, abundances, and community structure can identify patterns and trends within systems, provide mechanistic insight into ecosystem functioning, and contribute to ecosystem-based fisheries management. This study synthesized 10 yr of extensive fisheries-independent bottom trawl data (2002 to 2011) to evaluate drivers of demersal fish community structure in Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in the United States. Changes in community composition were assessed using constrained correspondence analysis. Also, aggregate community metrics (species richness, Simpson diversity, and catch-per-unit-effort [CPUE] of species groups) were modeled using generalized additive models. Five species (Atlantic croaker, white perch, spot, striped bass, and summer flounder) accounted for >75% of the total trawled biomass. The demersal fish community was primarily structured by the latitudinal salinity gradient that largely differentiated anadromous fishes from coastal shelf spawning species and elasmobranchs, with low overall CPUE and richness in mesohaline waters. Low dissolved oxygen concentrations (below similar to 4 mg l(-1)) greatly suppressed CPUE and diversity metrics and appeared to displace fish biomass toward the northern and southern edges of the bay's mainstem channel. Water temperature and month strongly influenced the seasonal dynamics of community composition and metrics. Community composition and biomass shifted after 2007, with a substantial decline in annual CPUE of some species groups.

We also explored how tree diversity was distributed across different spatial scales using additive partitioning of diversity. Swidden cultivation and rubber plantations showed decreased stem density, basal area, tree diversity, abundance of rare, endemic, and upper-layer trees, and increments of above- and below-ground biomass, which affected tree mortality, dominant trees, and species composition. Little distinction in species composition was observed among young and old fallows and rubber plantations, indicating a relatively quick recovery of the tree community in the early stages. The highest diversity was found among forest types, indicating that the whole forested landscape comprises a suitable scale for tree biodiversity conservation in the region. Our results suggest that although fragmented and old-growth forests have an irreplaceable role and a high priority in conserving biodiversity and sustaining the function of the forest ecosystem, secondary forests may also have a reinforcing role in maintaining tree diversity in the region, especially under the current circumstances in which a large portion of the landscape is human-modified and faces an increasing threat from the expansion of oil palm plantations.",5,2013,22,1,127,140"Bauer, JT; Kleczewski, NM; Bever, JD; Clay, K; Reynolds, HL","Nitrogen-fixing bacteria, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and the productivity and structure of prairie grassland communities",OECOLOGIA,Article,"Due to their complementary roles in meeting plant nutritional needs, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and nitrogen-fixing bacteria (N-2-fixers) may have synergistic effects on plant communities.

Our results demonstrate the importance of AMF and N-2-fixers as drivers of plant community structure and function. In the communities, we found a positive effect of AMF on diversity and productivity, but a negative effect of N-2-fixers on productivity. Both AMF and N-2-fixers affected relative abundances of species. AMF shifted the communities from dominance by Elymus canadensis to Sorghastrum nutans, and seven other species increased in abundance with AMF, accounting for the increased diversity. N-2-fixers led to increases in Astragalus canadensis and Desmanthus illinoense, two legumes that likely benefited from the presence of the appropriate rhizobia symbionts. Sorghastrum nutans declined 44 % in the presence of N-2-fixers, with the most likely explanation being increased competition from legumes. Panicum monocultures were more productive with AMF, but showed no response to N-2-fixers, although inference was constrained by low Azospirillum treatment effectivity.

Most wild animal populations are subjected to many perturbations, including environmental forcing and anthropogenic mortality. How population size varies in response to these perturbations largely depends on life-history strategy and density regulation. 2. Using the mid-continent population of redhead Aythya americana (a North American diving duck), we investigated the population response to two major perturbations, changes in breeding habitat availability (number of ponds in the study landscape) and changes in harvest regulations directed at managing mortality patterns (bag limit). We used three types of data collected at the continental scale (capturerecovery, population surveys and age- and sex ratios in the harvest) and combined them into integrated population models to assess the interaction between density dependence and the effect of perturbations. 3. We observed a two-way interaction between the effects on fecundity of pond number and population density. Hatch-year female survival was also density dependent. Matrix modelling showed that population booms could occur after especially wet years. However, the effect of moderate variation in pond number was generally offset by density dependence the following year. 4. Mortality patterns were insensitive to changes in harvest regulations and, in males at least, insensitive to density dependence as well. We discuss potential mechanisms for compensation of hunting mortality as well as possible confounding factors. 5.

Both parasites and predators are important factors shaping community structure and species composition of ecosystems. Here, we simultaneously exposed Daphnia magna to predator cues (released by the tadpole shrimp, Triops, or by a fish) and spores of the yeast parasite Metschnikowia sp. to determine how life history and morphological inducible defences against these two contrasting types of predators are affected by infection. Results: The parasite suppressed some Triops-induced defences: Daphnia lost the ability to produce a greater number of larger offspring, a life-history adaptation to Triops predation. In contrast, the parasite did not suppress inducible defences against fish: induction (resulting in smaller body length of the mothers as well as of their offspring) and infection acted additively on the measured traits. Thus, fish-induced defences may be less costly than inducible defences against small invertebrate predators like Triops; the latter defences could no longer be expressed when the host had already invested in fighting off the parasite. Conclusions: In summary, our study suggests that as specific inducible defences differ in their costs, some might be suppressed if a target prey is additionally infected. Therefore, adding parasite pressure to predator-prey systems can help to elucidate the costs of inducible defences.",5,2012,12,,,"Hidalgo, M; Rouyer, T; Bartolino, V; Cervino, S; Ciannelli, L; Massuti, E; Jadaud, A; Saborido-Rey, F; Durant, JM; Santurtun, M; Pineiro, C; Stenseth, NC",Context-dependent interplays between truncated demographies and climate variation shape the population growth rate of a harvested species,ECOGRAPHY,Article,"Fisheries ecologists traditionally aimed at disentangling climate and fishing effects from the population dynamics of exploited marine fish stocks. However, recent studies have shown that internal characteristics and external forcing (climate and exploitation) have interactive rather than additive effects.

Here we compared five exploited stocks of European hake Merluccius merluccius from the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea to investigate how the interaction between internal characteristics and external forces affect the variability of the population growth rate and their consequences on recruitment. Our results show that demographic truncation induces a novel population scenario in which the growth rate is maximized when the reproductive stock is younger and less diverse. This scenario is shaped by the climate variability and the fishing pattern. The population growth rate becomes more dependent on the maturation schedule and less on the survival rates. The consequences for the recruitment dynamics are twofold; the effect of density-dependent regulatory processes decreases while the effect of the density-independent drivers increases.

Heritability was significant for all traits under observation and genetic correlations between traits (r(A)) were low. Interestingly, we found substantial sex-specific genetic effects and low genetic correlations between sexes (r(MF)) in traits that are only moderately (weight at emergence) to slightly (longevity) sexually dimorphic. Furthermore, we found an increased sire (s(sire)(2)) compared to dam(s(dam)(2)) variance component within trait and sex. Our results highlight that the genetic architecture even of the same trait should not be assumed to be the same for males and females. Furthermore, it raises the issue of the presence of unnoticed environmental effects that may inflate estimates of heritability.

We also investigated some physical and biological mechanisms that may jointly explain such differences. The overall insect damage in H. latispatha was similar between road edges and natural forest gaps (8.0% vs. 7.2% of leaf area). Damage by caterpillars, however, decreased from 4.2 percent in forest gaps to 0.5 percent on road edges, whereas damage by leaf-cutting ants increased from 0 to 5.8 percent. In secondary riparian vegetation, where none of the leaves sampled were attacked by ants, overall herbivore damage in H. collinsiana was less than half that observed in forest gaps (3.0% vs. 6.7%), and driven mainly by differences in caterpillar damage (2.5% vs. 6.2%). By contrast, attack by leaf fungal pathogens was two to three times greater in both human-disturbed habitats than in gaps (8.29.6% vs. 3.74.2%).

Because microbial biofilms rapidly reflect environmental changes, we investigated the quantitative (C, N and chlorophyll a contents) and qualitative (microbial community composition) parameters and metabolic responses (O-2 fluxes) of biofilms established on glass slides to combinations of manipulated water temperatures (26, 29 and 31 degrees C), nitrate (0.5, 1.0 and 1.4 mu M), and light availabilities (40 and 200 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) in a 28 d flow-through aquarium experiment. The findings revealed that, independent of light availability, a temperature of 31 degrees C significantly decreased the 24 h net O-2 production and all of the quantitative parameters. Under high light, additive effects of 31 degrees C and 1.4 mu M nitrate reduced the 24 h net O-2 production. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (T-RFLP) of 16S rRNA genes showed light-independent temperature-induced microbial community shifts driven by increases in the relative abundance of Oceanospirillum (Gammaproteobacteria) and decreases of Cyanobacteria. The relative abundances of diatom plastids increased in response to elevated nitrate only in high-light-exposed biofilms. Overall, high temperatures altered microbial biofilm community composition, biomass and productivity. Under predicted near-future inner reef scenarios (low light and high nitrate availability), biofilms become light-limited through sedimentation, while outer (high light and low nitrate availability) inshore reef biofilms remain nitrate-limited.

Principle component analysis revealed significant positive relationships between catchment size and electrical conductivity, sulfate concentration, pH and median bed sediment size, and negative relationships with suspended sediment and aluminium concentrations. Seasonal variability was particularly evident in stream water temperature, benthic particulate organic matter and nitrate and chloride concentrations. Macroinvertebrate community abundance and diversity were typically similar across streams, but redundancy analysis demonstrated turnover of macroinvertebrate assemblages with increases in stream size. In particular, first-and second-order streams hosted small-sized stoneflies such as Amphinemura standfussi and Nemoura cambrica, while larger streams (third-and fourth-order) supported more mayflies and larger predatory stoneflies (e. g. Dinocras cephalotes and Perla bipunctata).

We investigated the abundance of gray-headed lemurs (Eulemur cinereiceps) and vegetation structure in the fragmented forest of Manombo from 1995 to 2007, including 10 yr following Cyclone Gretelle in January 1997. We predicted that the density of this arboreal, frugivorous lemur would be similar in the pre- and post-cyclone intervals only if tree measures demonstrate trends toward recovery in the post-cyclone period. Initial impacts included severe damage to over 60 percent of trees. After 10 yr, all vegetation metrics except for stem density remained low relative to the pre-cyclone period, including dbh, height, and basal area. To investigate vegetation changes separately from cyclone effects, we compared forest structure in the pre-cyclone period alone. Basal area declined but dbh and stem density did not vary between 1995 and 1997; thus, anthropogenic activities or other factors did not consistently alter forest structure in this 2-yr period. Subsequent changes may be linked to cyclone response, presumably in synergy with human disturbance. Contrary to predictions, recent gray-headed lemur population densities were nearly identical to those recorded in 1995 (13.5 +/- 3.2 vs. 13.6 +/- 6.4 individuals/km2, respectively).

Each species was exposed to various concentrations of toxicants (nickel, copper, chromium and Diesel Fuel) used separately or in combinations. Our results showed that RVPL increased with increasing amount of toxicants, visibly caused by a systematic decrease in body volume with toxicants. Responses of all examined species suggested an additive toxicological action. Predators (M. hirsutum and B. capacosus) showed the highest potential of adaptation because of their higher means of RVPL Observations during this experiment highlight the importance of pharyngeal pumping and cuticular structure to tolerating elevated catabolic water loss under stress conditions.

We sampled 659 plots in six watersheds over 2 yr. Two forest conditions (conserved and human disturbed, with three watersheds as replicates) were evaluated in the dry and rainy season. Within each watershed, plots were randomly located at three different distance categories from either stream edge: 0-10 m (near-stream environment), 30-40 m (mid-slope environment), and 50-60 m (upslope environment). Herpetofauna was surveyed by time-constrained searches with a sampling effort of 1980 person-hours. Eighteen anuran, 18 lizard and 23 snake species were recorded. Overall, abundance and diversity of lizards and snakes decreased from near-stream to upslope areas in both forest conditions and seasons; while that of anurans followed this trend only for the conserved forest during the rainy season.

Which species colonizes a habitat first may determine species coexistence or dominance. The strength of this priority effect will vary as a function of the interaction between life history processes and disturbance events at different spatial and temporal scales. On a local scale, disturbance tends to open up space, allowing new propagules to arrive, while on a regional scale, it has the potential to reduce source populations and the colonization ability of dispersal-limited species. Differences in larval longevity will have a direct influence on dispersal distance, the relative timing of colonization, and the impact of priority effects, especially when interacting with different disturbance regimes. This study presents a modeling exercise to highlight this synergy and its implications for invasive species and ecosystem management. Four life histories were simulated, representing species from the 4 common community states of Long Island Sound, USA: resident bryozoans, invasive ascidians, mussels, and the ascidian Diplosoma listerianum that is restricted to years with abnormally warm winters. Brooding species took longer to exert dominance than broadcast spawners, but were more resilient to disturbance, having less local extinctions.

However, little is known about the temporal dynamics of plant communities in relation to disturbances and their interactions. In this study we examined the response and recovery of temperate grassland communities to disturbance, using a multi-factorial experiment involving grazing exclusion (absent and present), fire (absent and present), soil cultivation (none, 5 and 20 cm) and soil amendment (none, fertiliser and fertiliser plus clover seeds) on the New England Tablelands in NSW, Australia. Temporal patterns of plant communities were analysed using detrended correspondence analysis for eight surveys over 24 months. Vegetation patterns at each survey were analysed using principal components analysis. The effects of treatments on malleability (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) of plant communities were analysed using a linear mixed model, and the relationships between malleability and plant species groups were depicted using a generalised additive model and further analysed using a linear model. Perennial native grasses and a non-native forb (Hypochaeris radicata) initially dominated the vegetation, but after the disturbances H. radicata and other non-native species dominated. Compositional changes from the initial states were greatest in the first spring (7 months after treatment application), and then the vegetation tended to recover towards its original state. Soil cultivation resulted in the greatest deviation in community composition, followed by soil amendment, fire, with grazing exclusion the least. The recovery process and rate of recovery varied with treatment reflecting the dominance of soil cultivation and its interactions with other forms of disturbances. Soil amendment and grazing exclusion tended to reduce the effects of soil cultivation. Malleability was negatively related to perennial native grasses; positively to other non-native species, annual native grasses and perennial native sedges/rushes; and negatively to H. radicata when its cover was below 18%, but positively when above 18%. The degree of malleability reflected the high resilience of the vegetation to disturbance, and was mainly due to the recovery of perennial native grasses and H. radicata. This resilience demonstrated that the small-scale disturbances did not cause vegetation to cross an ecological threshold and that the present vegetation is resilient to common disturbances occurring at small scales. The results also suggest (1) that the present vegetation has developed mechanisms to adapt to these disturbances, (2) the importance of disturbance scale or (3) that the ecological threshold had already been crossed and the present vegetation is in a degraded state compared with its original state before the end of the 19th century.",5,2007,193,1,39,57"Salbu, B; Skipperud, L",Challenges in radioecotoxicology,MULTIPLE STRESSORS: A CHALLENGE FOR THE FUTURE,Proceedings Paper,"Radioecotoxicology refers to responses, usually negative and detrimental responses, in living organisms exposed to radionuclides in ecosystems contaminated with artificially produced radionuclides or enriched with naturally occurring radionuclides. The key focus is put on the link between radionuclide exposures and the subsequent biological effects in flora and fauna. Radioecotoxicology is therefore an essential ingredient in impact and risk assessments associated with radioactive contaminated ecosystems. The radionuclide exposure depends on the source, release scenarios, transport, deposition and ecosystem characteristics as well as processes influencing the radionuclide speciation over time, in particular bioavailability, biological uptake, accumulation and internal distributions. Radionuclides released from a source may be present in different physico-chemical forms (e.g. low molecular mass species, colloids, pseudocolloids, particles) influencing biological uptake, accumulation, doses and biological effects in flora and fauna. Following releases from severe nuclear events, a major fraction of refractory radionuclides such as plutonium will be present as particles, representing point sources if inhaled or ingested. When organisms, and especially sensitive history life-stages, are exposed to radionuclides, free radicals are induced and subsequently, effects in several umbrella biological endpoints (e.g. reproduction and immune system failures, genetic instability and mutation, increased morbidity and mortality) may occur. However, radionuclides released into the environment rarely occur alone, but may co-occur in a mixture of other contaminants (e.g. metals, pesticides, organics, endocrine disruptors), which potentially could lead to synergisms or antagonisms. Thus, the relationships between radionuclide exposure and especially long-term effects are difficult to document and quantify, reflecting that the challenges within radioecotoxicology are multiple.",5,2007,,,3,12"Rodriguez-Estrella, R; Carmen, M; Moreno, B","Rare, fragile species, small populations, and the dilemma of collections",BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,Article,"Considerable sums of money are aimed at biodiversity conservation programs at present, and although collection of specimens is necessary for the advancement of taxonomy and systematics, we detected a dilemma between conservation and collection of rare species with small populations.

Most conservation measures are reactive to development projects that threaten the sites' conservation values. There is little synergy between nature conservation and other competing land-use policies. Furthermore, conservation messages are not communicated well because there are few opportunities for those involved in research, policy formation and policy implementation to interact. We illustrate the methodological framework that can be used to address these issues in rural nature conservation by presenting our research conducted in the Arai-Keinan district of Niigata, Japan. The proposed methodological framework consists of integrating visual and biological landscape approaches to understand the area's natural environment and using participatory research to narrow the communication gaps among those involved. We stress the importance of expressing the research results and recommendations on a map as a strategy for effective nature conservation. The graphical presentation of a map not only allows for clearer delivery of messages from researchers to government officials and residents, but also facilitates coordination among competing land-use policies. The map is the central ammunition in reversing the reactive nature of conservation policies to that of a ""preemptive"" nature. Future research directions to gain stronger political support are also discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

A no-stressor control case was estimated against which exploitation-only, toxaphene-only and cumulative exploitation and toxaphene stressor cases were compared to determine the extent and significance of impacts. Single stressor case results were used to predict cumulative impacts by assuming additivity and predictions compared to modelled cumulative stressor results. Comparisons indicated the inadequacy of assuming additivity in predicting cumulative impacts. A factorial experimental design was used to estimate the size and significance of interactive effects. Effects are substantial and underscore the necessity of interpreting probable impacts of increases in a single stressor in conjunction with knowledge of other stressors acting on a population. A positive functional relationship between variability in population abundance and stress was estimated and is suggested as a potentially useful means of characterizing risks posed to populations by increases in, or additions to, population stressors. Multiple stressors were also demonstrated to effectively eliminate the significance of density-dependent mortality processes in determining age 0+ and adult abundance.

Model deduction and analysis,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Article,"Regarding time ranges of years, a rationale has been developed which is capable of explaining observed 'spruce decline' symptoms observed when spruce is exposed to air containing ambient levels of SO2. It integrates and interrelates (i) ecophysiological data (tree morphology, assimilate partitioning, canopy turnover, senescence physiology, stomatal conductance, canopy throughfall, sulphur metabolism, tonoplast symport), (ii) pedological data (soil leaching, cation recycling, litter decomposition, forest nutrition), and (iii) meteorological data (site elevation, length of the annual trunk growth period, SO2-pollution). Furthermore, it can explain field observations at numerous sites of spruce decline in central Europe where SO2 is implicated as a factor of forest decline: (i) thinning of the canopy structure; (ii) early needle senescence; (iii) cation deficiency; (iv) low SO2 tolerance at sites with depleted soils in the mountains; (v) synergism of SO2 pollution and acidic precipitation; (vi) recovery after liming, fertilization and after decreasing SO2 pollution; and (vii) higher SO2 tolerances of deciduous angiosperms. Different SO2 tolerance strategies are identified that are employed by more SO2-tolerant tree species. Ecophysiological SO2 tolerance factors interact in a complex synergistic or antagonistic manner. It is concluded that chronic SO2 pollution at ambient concentrations predisposes mainly evergreen gymnosperms to suffer under synergistic environmental stresses (frost, drought, pathogens, etc.). Thinning of the crown structure is massive at extreme sites, where several stresses act simultaneously on the trees (depleted soils, high SO2 pollution, acidic rain, etc.). Mathematical formulations allow precise definitions of terms such as cooperativity, synergism, antagonism, vitality, predisposition, latency, etc. This universal rationale, which is applicable to all tree species, is exemplified here for Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.). Integration of parameters yields an ordinary differential equation, which can be solved analytically.

Some disturbances can drive ecological systems to abrupt shifts between alternative stages (tipping points) when critical transitions occur. Drought-induced tree death can be considered as a nonlinear shift in tree vigour and growth. However, at what point do trees become predisposed to drought-related dieback and which factors determine this (tipping) point? We investigated these questions by characterizing the responses of three tree species, silver fir (Abies alba), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis), to a severe drought event. 2. We compared basal area increment (BAI) trends and responses to climate and drought in declining (very defoliated and dying) vs. non-declining (slightly or not defoliated) trees by using generalized additive mixed models. Defoliation, BAI and sapwood production were related to functional proxies of tree vigour measured at the onset and end of the drought (non-structural carbohydrate concentrations, needle N content and C isotopic discrimination, presence of wood-inhabiting fungi). We evaluated whether early warning signals (increases in synchronicity among trees or in autocorrelation and standard deviation) could be extracted from the BAI series prior to tree death. 3. Declining silver fir and Scots pine trees showed less growth than non-declining trees one to three decades, respectively, before the drought event, whereas Aleppo pines showed growth decline irrespective of tree defoliation. At the end of the drought period, all species showed increased defoliation and a related reduction in the concentration of sapwood soluble sugars. Defoliation was constrained by the BAI of the previous 5 years and sapwood production. No specific wood-inhabiting fungi were found in post-drought declining trees apart from blue-stain fungi, which extensively affected damaged Scots pines. Declining silver firs showed increases in BAI autocorrelation and variability prior to tree death. 4. Synthesis. Early warning signals of drought-triggered mortality seem to be species specific and reflect how different tree species cope with drought stress. Highly correlated declining growth patterns during drought can serve as a signal in silver fir, whereas changes in the content of sapwood soluble sugars are suitable vigour proxies for Scots and Aleppo pines. Longer growth and defoliation series, additional vigour parameters and multi-species comparisons are required to understand and predict drought-induced tree death.",4,2015,103,1,44,57"Paaby, AB; Bergland, AO; Behrman, EL; Schmidt, PS",A highly pleiotropic amino acid polymorphism in the Drosophila insulin receptor contributes to life-history adaptation,EVOLUTION,Article,"Finding the specific nucleotides that underlie adaptive variation is a major goal in evolutionary biology, but polygenic traits pose a challenge because the complex genotype-phenotype relationship can obscure the effects of individual alleles. However, natural selection working in large wild populations can shift allele frequencies and indicate functional regions of the genome. Previously, we showed that the two most common alleles of a complex amino acid insertion-deletion polymorphism in the Drosophila insulin receptor show independent, parallel clines in frequency across the North American and Australian continents. Here, we report that the cline is stable over at least a five-year period and that the polymorphism also demonstrates temporal shifts in allele frequency concurrent with seasonal change. We tested the alleles for effects on levels of insulin signaling, fecundity, development time, body size, stress tolerance, and life span. We find that the alleles are associated with predictable differences in these traits, consistent with patterns of Drosophila life-history variation across geography that likely reflect adaptation to the heterogeneous climatic environment.

In particular, some of the same mechanisms that underlie positive effects of corridors on species of conservation interest may also increase the spread and impact of antagonistic species (e.g., predators and pathogens), foster negative effects of edges, increase invasion by exotic species, increase the spread of unwanted disturbances such as fire, or increase population synchrony and thus reduce persistence. We conducted a literature review and meta-analysis to evaluate the prevalence of each of these negative effects. We found no evidence that corridors increase unwanted disturbance or non-native species invasion; however, these have not been well-studied concerns (1 and 6 studies, respectively). Other effects of corridors were more often studied and yielded inconsistent results; mean effect sizes were indistinguishable from zero. The effect of edges on abundances of target species was as likely to be positive as negative. Corridors were as likely to have no effect on antagonists or population synchrony as they were to increase those negative effects. We found 3 deficiencies in the literature. First, despite studies on how corridors affect predators, there are few studies of related consequences for prey population size and persistence. Second, properly designed studies of negative corridor effects are needed in natural corridors at scales larger than those achievable in experimental systems. Third, studies are needed to test more targeted hypotheses about when corridor-mediated effects on invasive species or disturbance may be negative for species of management concern. Overall, we found no overarching support for concerns that construction and maintenance of habitat corridors may result in unintended negative consequences. Negative edge effects may be mitigated by widening corridors or softening edges between corridors and the matrix. Other negative effects are relatively small and manageable compared with the large positive effects of facilitating dispersal and increasing diversity of native species.

We assessed the heritable variation underlying differences in hormonal phenotypes using a cross-foster experimental design with nestling North American barn swallows (Hirundo rustica erythrogaster). Using a bivariate animal model, we partitioned variance in baseline and stress-induced CORT concentrations into their additive genetic and rearing environment components and estimated their genetic correlation. Both baseline and stress-induced CORT were heritable with heritability of 0.152 and 0.343, respectively. We found that the variation in baseline CORT was best explained by rearing environment, whereas the variation in stress-induced CORT was contributed to by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Further, we did not detect a genetic correlation between these two hormonal traits. Although rearing environment appears to play an important role in the secretion of both types of CORT, our results suggest that stress-induced CORT levels are underlain by greater additive genetic variance compared with baseline CORT levels. Accordingly, we infer that the glucocorticoid response to stress has a greater potential for evolutionary change in response to selection compared with baseline glucocorticoid secretion patterns.",4,2014,281,1790,,"Berger, D; Grieshop, K; Lind, MI; Goenaga, J; Maklakov, AA; Arnqvist, G",INTRALOCUS SEXUAL CONFLICT AND ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS,EVOLUTION,Article,"Intralocus sexual conflict (IaSC) occurs when selection at a given locus favors different alleles in males and females, placing a fundamental constraint on adaptation.

We compared IaSC at a benign (29 degrees C) and a stressful (36 degrees C) temperature by estimating r(MF)s in two natural populations of the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus using isofemale lines. In one population, we found substantial IaSC under benign conditions signified by a negative r(MF) (-0.51) and, as predicted, a significant reduction of IaSC under stress signified by a reversed and positive r(MF) (0.21). The other population displayed low IaSC at both temperatures (r(MF): 0.38; 0.40). In both populations, isofemale lines harboring alleles beneficial to males but detrimental to females at benign conditions tended to show overall low fitness under stress.

Sexually antagonistic selection is thought to be the main selective driver of this reduced recombination, with tighter linkage strengthening the association between alleles favourable to females and the X, as well as alleles favourable to males and the Y. Nevertheless, many sex chromosomes retain substantial levels of recombination over millions of years, and some old sex chromosomes remain homomorphic with few signs of recombination suppression and the chromosomal degradation expected to follow. This paper explores the selective factors that can maintain recombination between the sex chromosomes. Specifically, by analysing the dynamics of genes that modify the rate of recombination, I present results demonstrating that certain forms of selection - all involving overdominance in males - can positively maintain recombination in the pseudo-autosomal region. To understand these cases, one has to revise our standard view of sexual antagonistic selection as involving two partners (males and females) to three partners (the X in females, the X in males and the Y).",4,2014,27,7,1431,1442"Cabral, JS; Weigelt, P; Kissling, WD; Kreft, H","Biogeographic, climatic and spatial drivers differentially affect alpha-, beta- and gamma-diversities on oceanic archipelagos",PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,Article,"Island biogeographic studies traditionally treat single islands as units of analysis.

Here, we took a fundamentally different approach and focused on entire archipelagos using species richness of vascular plants on 23 archipelagos worldwide and their 174 constituent islands. We assessed differential effects of biogeographic factors (area, isolation, age, elevation), current and past climate (temperature, precipitation, seasonality, climate change velocity) and intra-archipelagic spatial structure (archipelago area, number of islands, area range, connectivity, environmental volume, inter-island distance) on plant diversity. Species diversity of each archipelago (gamma) was additively partitioned into alpha, beta, nestedness and replacement beta-components to investigate the relative importance of environmental and spatial drivers. Multiple regressions revealed strong effects of biogeography and climate on alpha and gamma, whereas spatial factors, particularly number of islands, inter-island distance and area range, were key to explain beta. Structural equation models additionally suggested that gamma is predominantly determined by indirect abiotic effects via its components, particularly beta. This highlights that beta and the spatial arrangement of islands are essential to understand insular ecology and evolution.

Nevertheless, many bivalve stocks have dramatically declined, and recruitment failure due to (anthropogenically-) increased predation by mesopredators and loss of facilitation mechanisms have been separately hypothesized as underlying causes. Here, we tested the interactive effects of predation and habitat modification on bivalve recruitment in a large-scale experiment in the Wadden Sea, one of the world's largest intertidal soft-sediment ecosystems. We applied anti-erosion mats to simulate biotic attachment and substrate stabilization by commonly found tubeworm beds, crossed this with addition of adult mussels, and manipulated shrimp and crab predation using exclosures within these treatments. Epibenthic mussel recruits were only found in treatments with manipulated substrates, attached to either the anti-erosion mat or adult mussels. Three out of four endobenthic species were facilitated by the mat, but were inhibited by adult mussels. In contrast, invasive surf-dwelling American razor clams were inhibited by both substrate manipulations, indicating a preference for unstable sediments. These facilitation and inhibition effects, however, only clearly emerged when predators were excluded, demonstrating strong synergistic effects between predation and habitat modification. Our findings suggest that disturbance of trophic interactions and loss of habitat modifying species interactively affect bivalve recruitment dynamics in coastal ecosystems. We conclude that conservation and restoration of bivalves should focus on protecting and restoring internal facilitation mechanisms, and should simultaneously reduce excessive mesopredator predation by restoring natural food web dynamics, including the role of top-predators.

As modular genetic elements that are often conjugative, the selective pressures that act on plasmid-borne genes are distinct from those that act on the chromosome. Many bacteria are co-infected by multiple plasmids that impart niche-specific phenotypes. Thus, in addition to host-plasmid dynamics, interactions between co-infecting plasmids are likely to be important drivers of plasmid population dynamics, evolution and ecology. Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a facultative plant pathogen that commonly harbours two distinct megaplasmids. Virulence depends on the presence of the tumour-inducing (Ti) plasmid, with benefits that are primarily restricted to the disease environment. Here, we demonstrate that a second megaplasmid, the At plasmid, confers a competitive advantage in the rhizosphere. To assess the individual and interactive costs of these plasmids, we generated four isogenic derivatives: plasmidless, pAt only, pTi only and pAtpTi, and performed pairwise competitions under carbon-limiting conditions. These studies reveal a low cost to the virulence plasmid when outside of the disease environment, and a strikingly high cost to the At plasmid. In addition, the costs of pAt and pTi in the same host were significantly lower than predicted based on single plasmid costs, signifying the first demonstration of non-additivity between naturally occurring co-resident plasmids. Based on these empirically demonstrated costs and benefits, we developed a resource-consumer model to generate predictions about the frequencies of these genotypes in relevant environments, showing that non-additivity between co-residing plasmids allows for their stable coexistence across environments.",4,2014,281,1779,,"Orwin, KH; Ostle, N; Wilby, A; Bardgett, RD",Effects of species evenness and dominant species identity on multiple ecosystem functions in model grassland communities,OECOLOGIA,Article,"Ecosystems provide multiple services upon which humans depend.

Much research has investigated how species richness influences functioning, but we lack knowledge of how other community attributes affect ecosystem functioning. Species evenness, species spatial arrangement, and the identity of dominant species are three attributes that could affect ecosystem functioning, by altering the relative abundance of functional traits and the probability of synergistic species interactions such as facilitation and complementary resource use. We tested the effect of these three community attributes and their interactions on ecosystem functions over a growing season, using model grassland communities consisting of three plant species from three functional groups: a grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), a forb (Plantago lanceolata), and a N-fixing forb (Lotus corniculatus). We measured multiple ecosystem functions that support ecosystem services, including ecosystem gas exchange, water retention, C and N loss in leachates, and plant biomass production. Species evenness and dominant species identity strongly influenced the ecosystem functions measured, but spatial arrangement had few effects. By the end of the growing season, evenness consistently enhanced ecosystem functioning and this effect occurred regardless of dominant species identity. The identity of the dominant species under which the highest level of functioning was attained varied across the growing season. Spatial arrangement had the weakest effect on functioning, but interacted with dominant species identity to affect some functions.

Assessing the combined impact of climate change and OA on marine ecosystems is a challenging task. The response of the ecosystem to a single driver can be highly variable and remains still uncertain; additionally the interaction between these can be either synergistic or antagonistic. In this work we use the coupled oceanographic- ecosystem model POLCOMS-ERSEM driven by climate forcing to study the interaction between climate change and OA. We focus in particular on carbonate chemistry, primary and secondary production. The model has been run in three different configurations in order to assess separately the impacts of climate change on net primary production and of OA on the carbonate chemistry, which have been strongly supported by scientific literature, from the impact of biological feedbacks of OA on the ecosystem, whose uncertainty still has to be well constrained. The global mean of the projected decrease of pH at the end of the century is about 0.27 pH units, but the model shows significant interaction among the drivers and high variability in the temporal and spatial response. As a result of this high variability, critical tipping point can be locally and/ or temporally reached: e.g. undersaturation with respect to aragonite is projected to occur in the deeper part of the central North Sea during summer.

Decisions about land-use management in agroecosystems involve spatial and temporal trade-offs. The key scales at which these trades-offs occur are poorly understood for most systems, and quantitative assessments of the services provided by agroecosystems under different combinations of land uses are rare. To fill these knowledge gaps, we measured 12 ecosystem services (ES), including climate regulation, gas regulation, soil stability, nutrient regulation, habitat quality, raw material production, food production, fishing, sports, recreation, education, and social relationships, in seven common land-use types at three spatial scales, i.e., patch, municipality, and landscape, in a riparian floodplain in Spain. We identified the provision of each ES in each land-use type either by direct measurement or from public databases. We analyzed the interactions, i.e., trade-offs and synergies, among ES across land uses and spatial scales and estimated ES provision in several land-use change scenarios. Our results illustrated that each land-use type provides unique bundles of ES and that the spatial scale at which measurements were taken affected the mixture of services. For instance, a land-use type with low provision of services per hectare but with an extensive area can supply more services to the overall landscape than a land-use type supplying higher values of services per hectare but with a smaller extent. Hence, riparian forest supplied the most service of any land-use type at the patch scale, but dry cereal croplands provided the most services across the municipality and landscape because of their large area. We found that most ES should be managed primarily at the patch scale, but food production, fishing, and social relationships were more relevant to manage at the municipality scale. There was great variability in ES interactions across scales with different causes of trade-offs at each scale. We identified more significant synergies among ES than trade-offs. Trade-offs were originated because some services were mutually incompatible within a given land use, whereas the provision of others depended on land-management decisions within a land-use type. Thus, we propose a classification of ES interactions that incorporates societal values as drivers of management decisions along with biophysical factors as likely causes of ES trade-offs and conclude with practical suggestions to reduce trade-offs and to enhance the supply of multiple ES to society.",4,2014,19,1,,"Rebollo, S; Milchunas, DG; Stapp, P; Augustine, DJ; Derner, JD",Disproportionate effects of non-colonial small herbivores on structure and diversity of grassland dominated by large herbivores,OIKOS,Article,"The response of semiarid grasslands to small, non-colonial herbivores has received little attention, focusing primarily on the effects of granivore assemblages on annual plant communities. We studied the long-term effects of both small and large herbivores on vegetation structure and species diversity of shortgrass steppe, a perennial semiarid grassland considered marginal habitat for small mammalian herbivores. We hypothesized that 1) large generalist herbivores would affect more abundant species and proportions of litter-bare ground-vegetation cover through non-selective herbivory, 2) small herbivores would affect less common species through selective but limited consumption, and 3) herbivore effects on plant richness would increase with increasing aboveground net primary production (ANPP).

Exclusion of large herbivores affected litter and bare ground and basal cover of abundant, common and uncommon species. Additional exclusion of small herbivores did not affect uncommon components of the plant community, but had indirect effects on abundant species, decreased the cover of the dominant grass Bouteloua gracilis and total vegetation, and increased litter and species diversity. There was no relationship between ANPP and the intensity of effects of either herbivore body size on richness. Exclusion of herbivores of both body sizes had complementary and additive effects which promoted changes in vegetation composition and physiognomy that were linked to increased abundance of tall and decreased abundance of short species.

They hold great conservation potential and there is demand for assessments of their biodiversity value. Forest disturbance and forest loss often occur together, yet few studies attempt to disentangle their separate effects on biological communities. In the Ecuadorian Choco, a biodiversity hotspot, we sampled understory birds in patches with increasing levels of disturbance (old-growth, selectively-logged, and secondary forests) within contiguous forest and in fragments. Species richness increased with disturbance but decreased with habitat loss, with a 75% reduction in endemic and threatened species in fragments compared to contiguous forest. This reduction in richness was most pronounced in secondary forest fragments, suggesting that disturbance and habitat loss interact synergistically to maximally reduce avian biodiversity. Species composition was strongly affected by habitat loss and, to a lesser extent, disturbance, with forest fragments and secondary forests presenting distinct communities dominated by generalists with medium-to-low sensitivity to anthropogenic disturbance and reduced proportions of endemics and endangered species. Capture rates also decreased (non-significantly) with habitat loss, and the relative abundance of dietary guilds varied in response to both habitat loss and disturbance. Our study shows that regenerating patches surrounded by contiguous forest can sustain high biodiversity levels and, when past habitat disturbance is mild, present similar communities to old-growth forests. In contrast, forest loss caused reductions in richness (especially in more disturbed patches), profound changes in community composition, and loss of species of conservation concern.

Data obtained were used to build correlative species distribution models (SDMs) and forecasts for future decades (2020s, 2050s and 2080s) under the A1b emissions scenario, using four statistical techniques (generalised linear models, generalised additive models, random forest, and multivariate adaptive regression). Results The SDMs showed an excellent performance. Climate was a better predictor than stream topography, while land cover characteristics were not necessary to improve performance. Forecasts predict the distribution of S. trutta to become increasingly restricted over time. The geographical extent of data had a weak impact on model performance and gain/loss values, but better species response curves were generated using data from all three basins collectively. By 2080, 64% of the stream reaches sampled will be unsuitable habitats for S. trutta, with Elbe basin being the most affected, and virtually no new habitats will be gained in any basin. Main conclusions More reliable predictions are obtained when the geographical data used for modelling approximate the environmental range where the species is present. Future research incorporating both correlative and mechanistic approaches may increase robustness and accuracy of predictions.",4,2013,19,8,1059,1071"Patsias, K; Bruelheide, H",Climate change - Bad news for montane forest herb layer species?,ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Article,"Global warming presents a threat to plant species distributed at montane or alpine altitudes if the topography does not allow upward shifts in distribution ranges. Nevertheless, the species might also benefit from increasing temperatures and secondary effects on dominant species (e.g. bark beetle outbreaks or summer drought affecting the canopy species). As a consequence, disturbance frequency in montane forests might increase and light availability for herb layer species will increase. We addressed these interactions in a common garden experiment in Central Germany at different altitudes, representing cold and moist vs. warm and dry conditions. We investigated three montane species with different life forms, including a herb (Trientalis europaea), a grass (Calamagrostis villosa) and a dwarf shrub (Vaccinium myrtillus) under three shading treatments (3%, 28% and 86% of full sunlight). We hypothesized that montane species are at a disadvantage in the lowland, with the dwarf shrub suffering more than the grass. Furthermore, we hypothesized an antagonistic interaction of increased temperature and increased light conditions. While T europaea and v myrtillus showed only slightly responses to low altitude conditions, C villosa displayed a nearly fifteen fold increase in biomass production, despite higher observed herbivory levels in the lowland. We failed to show an antagonistic effect of increased temperature and increased light availability, as all study species suffered from deep shade conditions and grew best under full light conditions at both sites. In conclusion, both improved temperature and light conditions might be principally beneficial for the investigated boreal species, in particular for the grass species C villosa.

Here we seek to understand how abiotic and biotic stresses associated with climate change can affect plant-herbivore interactions in a model crop species (soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr.) by answering three questions: (1) Do the combined effects of abiotic and biotic stresses associated with climate change cause synergistic negative effects on plant biomass? (2) Can abiotic stress affect resistance of plants to insect herbivores? (3) Does genetic variation in plant traits modify a plant's response to stress? We performed three experiments in controlled growth environments using up to 51 soybean genotypes selected to vary in numerous traits associated with drought and resistance against pests (e.g., insect herbivores, nematodes, and pathogenic fungi), and up to 3 generalist-feeding herbivorous noctuid moth species (Helicoverpa zea, Heliothis virescens, and Spodoptera exigua) that commonly feed on soybean in North America. Drought and herbivory had the largest and the most consistent negative effects on plant performance, reducing the above- and below-ground biomass by 10-45 %, whereas increased temperature had little to no effect on plants. Drought also increased susceptibility to generalist noctuid herbivores, but these results varied dramatically in magnitude and direction among plant genotypes. Our experiments show that the effects of abiotic and biotic stress on soybean biomass were largely due to the additive effects of these stresses, and there exists substantial genetic variation in the soybean germplasm pool we studied that could be used as a source of parental stock in breeding new crops that can more effectively tolerate and resist the combined negative effects of insect herbivory and drought.",4,2013,7,2,201,215"van Heerwaarden, B; Sgro, CM",Multivariate analysis of adaptive capacity for upper thermal limits in Drosophila simulans,JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,Article,"Thermal tolerance is an important factor influencing the distribution of ectotherms, but our understanding of the ability of species to evolve different thermal limits is limited. Based on univariate measures of adaptive capacity, it has recently been suggested that species may have limited evolutionary potential to extend their upper thermal limits under ramping temperature conditions that better reflect heat stress in nature. To test these findings more broadly, we used a paternal half-sibling breeding design to estimate the multivariate evolutionary potential for upper thermal limits in Drosophila simulans. We assessed heat tolerance using static (basal and hardened) and ramping assays. Our analyses revealed significant evolutionary potential for all three measures of heat tolerance. Additive genetic variances were significantly different from zero for all three traits. Our G matrix analysis revealed that all three traits would contribute to a response to selection for increased heat tolerance. Significant additive genetic covariances and additive genetic correlations between static basal and hardened heat-knockdown time, marginally nonsignificant between static basal and ramping heat-knockdown time, indicate that direct and correlated responses to selection for increased upper thermal limits are possible. Thus, combinations of all three traits will contribute to the evolution of upper thermal limits in response to selection imposed by a warming climate. Reliance on univariate estimates of evolutionary potential may not provide accurate insight into the ability of organisms to evolve upper thermal limits in nature.",4,2013,26,4,800,809"Harbeitner, RC; Hahn, ME; Timme-Laragy, AR",Differential sensitivity to pro-oxidant exposure in two populations of killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus),ECOTOXICOLOGY,Article,"New Bedford Harbor (MA, U.S.A.; NBH) is a Superfund site inhabited by Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) with altered aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) signaling, leading to resistance to effects of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). The Ahr is a transcription factor that regulates gene expression of many Phase I and II detoxifying enzymes and interacts with Nrf2, a transcription factor that regulates the response to oxidative stress. This study tested the hypothesis that PCB-resistant killifish exhibit altered sensitivity to oxidative stress. Killifish F-1 embryos from NBH and a clean reference site (Scorton Creek, MA, U.S.A.; SC) were exposed to model pro-oxidant and Nrf2-activator, tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ). Embryos were exposed at specific embryonic developmental stages (5, 7, and 9 days post fertilization) and toxicity was assessed, using a deformity score, survival, heart rate, and gene expression to compare sensitivity between PCB -resistant and -sensitive (reference) populations. Acute exposure to tBHQ resulted in transient reduction in heart rate in NBH and SC F-1 embryos. However, embryos from NBH were more sensitive to tBHQ, with more frequent and severe deformities, including pericardial edema, tail deformities, small body size, and reduced pigment and erythrocytes. NBH embryos had lower basal expression of antioxidant genes catalase and glutathione-S-transferase alpha (gsta), and upon exposure to tBHQ, exhibited lower levels of expression of catalase, gsta, and superoxide dismutase compared to controls. This result suggests that adaptation to tolerate PCBs has altered the sensitivity of NBH fish to oxidative stress during embryonic development, demonstrating a cost of the PCB resistance adaptation.",4,2013,22,2,387,401"Poggio, SL; Chaneton, EJ; Ghersa, CM",The arable plant diversity of intensively managed farmland: Effects of field position and crop type at local and landscape scales,AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,Article,"Agro-ecosystem biodiversity is threatened by increasing spatial homogenisation of intensively managed farmland. Yet current understanding of patterns of arable plant diversity at various scales remains limited. We evaluated the extent to which species richness of arable plants in the Rolling Pampas of Argentina is determined by field position (fencerow, edge and centre) and crop type, at both field (local) and landscape scales. Plant richness was assessed in maize, soybean and wheat-soybean fields across four landscape types differing in spatial complexity, as defined by percentage area devoted to cropland. Species richness was hierarchically nested within landscape types, field positions and crop types. Landscape richness (gamma-diversity, the cumulative number of species in a set of fields) was additively partitioned into two components, one for local richness (alpha-diversity, the mean number of species per field) and one denoting differences in species composition among fields (alpha-diversity, where beta = gamma - alpha). Field position was the main determinant of landscape-scale plant richness. Overall, gamma-diversity declined from fencerows, through field edges to field centres, but was unaffected by crop type. Spatial variation in species composition (beta-diversity), rather than species packing within fields (alpha-diversity), accounted for most of the variation in arable gamma-diversity. Higher beta-diversity in field edges than in field centres suggested that propagule dispersal from fencerow vegetation may create a 'mass effect' onto certain crop types. Shifts in gamma-diversity of major perennial life-forms (chamaeophytes and phanerophytes) between field positions and crop types reflected the contrasting disturbance regimes affecting plant communities of fencerows and cultivated fields. Our results indicate that preserving coherent and extensive fencerow networks is essential to conserve farmland biodiversity. Moreover, maintaining landscape heterogeneity to support elevated beta-diversities of arable plants requires cropping systems that promote crop diversity in both space and time.

Aquatic organisms are increasingly exposed to environmental changes linked with human activities in river catchments. For instance, the clogging of bottom substratum by fine sediments is observed in many rivers and usually leads to a decrease in dissolved oxygen concentrations in gravel beds. Such hypoxic stress can alter the development and even be lethal for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) embryos that spend their early life into gravel beds. In this study, we used a common garden experiment to compare the responses to hypoxic stress of four genetically differentiated and environmentally contrasted populations. We used factorial crossing designs to measure additive genetic variation of early life-history traits in each population. Embryos were reared under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and we measured their survival, incubation time and length at the end of embryonic development. Under hypoxic conditions, embryos had a lower survival and hatched later than in normoxic conditions. We found different hypoxia reaction norms among populations, but almost no population effect in both treatments. We also detected significant sire x treatment interactions in most populations and a tendency for heritability values to be lower under stressful conditions.

Climate change, habitat loss and nitrogen deposition have been identified as the key threats to biodiversity loss in these regions, yet their combined effects are poorly understood. We measured the interactive effects of rainfall manipulation (reduction, control, addition) and nitrogen deposition (N addition, N 1 P addition, and unfertilised) on the establishment of 19 Banksia-woodland species planted at three sites in southwestern Australia. Seedling survival and aboveground biomass was increased with water addition but was not affected by rainfall reduction. N addition alone did not impact seedling survival and growth, but interacted with rainfall manipulation and site in unpredictable ways. Treatment effects were context dependent, which we attributed to historic nutrient enrichment and competitive exotic species that prevented seedling establishment. Plant species (n 5 6) varied greatly in their water-use efficiency and nitrogen-use efficiency responses to the imposed treatments, which underscores the difficulty of generalising results to larger numbers of species. Despite our finding that rainfall manipulation and nutrient addition have complex, and in some cases antagonistic effects on seedling survival and growth in Banksia woodlands, our results suggest that local context (i.e. invasive species, land-use history) will have as much influence on seedling establishment as global changes in climate and nitrogen deposition. We call for more field experiments and predictive models to explore further the importance of ecological context in determining the interactive effects of multiple global change drivers on ecosystems.

In this study, we characterized gap recovery after complete removal of eelgrass (Zostera marina) in Willapa Bay, Washington, USA. In separate experiments, we imposed two disturbance types - shoot damage and shoot removal - at different magnitudes and frequencies. We examined a broad suite of morphological and life history responses relevant to the ability of Z. marina to tolerate and recolonize following disturbance. We found that at multiple sites, 4 m(2) gaps in eelgrass meadows recovered in 2 years. Experiments revealed that cut shoots had a short-term reduction in growth, decline in shoot width in relation to the number of cutting events, and a drop in clonal branching. In contrast, in thinned plots, both clonal branching and seedling size increased. Upper-elevation intertidal plants shared many traits of cut plants, particularly lower growth and size, but maintained similar clonal branching and shoot densities as at lower intertidal elevations. Sexual reproduction appeared inflexible to disturbances imposed over the summer experimental period but differed by elevation, with upper-elevation plants showing increased flowering, lower seedling densities, but higher seedling survival. Effects of multiple disturbances were generally additive even though individually their effects varied in magnitude and direction. One exception was an antagonism that appeared in sheath width: cutting had less effect at upper than lower elevation. Overall, Z. marina tolerated shoot damage through remodeling that reduced shoot size, and shoots compensated following loss of neighbors via enhanced clonal branching. Recolonization in this estuary should be further accelerated by sexual reproduction, despite weak responses to disturbance treatments, because seedling densities in late summer (4 m(-2)) contributed 20-56% of shoot births.

We have, however, poor knowledge on how ecologically similar species differ in their biomarker responsiveness and how predation risk may affect these biomarkers, potentially in an interactive way with pesticides. We evaluated this by exposing four corixid water bug species to combinations of endosulfan and predation risk and quantifying the activity of four general enzymatic biomarkers: acetylcholinesterase (AChE), phenoloxidase (PO), catalase (CAT) and superoxidedismutase (SOD). AChE activity was inhibited at an endosulfan concentration of 2 mu g l(-1) and this did not differ significantly among species. Predation risk inhibited AChE activity with the same magnitude as endosulfan in one species, S. striata. Reduction in the investment of immune function following pesticide exposure, as measured by the activity of PO, was only observed in C. coleoptrata at 8 mu g l(-1) while we observed an increase of PO levels in S. striata. Overall, PO was suppressed under predation risk at 8 mu g l(-1) endosulfan. For SOD we observed a pesticide-induced increase across all species under predation risk, while for CAT the pesticide-induced increase was only present without predation risk. These results indicate that even within this group of ecologically similar and closely related species opposing biomarker responses may exist, as observed for PO.

The performance (frequency, abundance, and size) of the two associate species in neighbored patches (patches formed by a dominant species which were closely adjacent to the patches formed by the other dominant species), isolated patches (patches formed by one dominant species with no neighbor), and open areas was compared to analyze the individual and combined effects of the two dominant species. A. splendens and N. tangutorum appeared to have reciprocal facilitation effects when growing adjacent to one another, as evidenced by the increased size of neighbored patches over isolated ones. The individual effects of A. splendens on the associate species should be generally neutral, since the frequency, abundance, size, and co-occurrence frequency of the two associate species in isolated A. splendens patches and open areas were the same (except for the significantly larger size of R. soongorica in isolated A. splendens patches). The individual effects of N. tangutorum were positive to the associate species R. soongorica, as evidenced by the fact that the frequency and abundance of R. soongorica was significantly higher (P < 0.05), and the size of two associate species was significantly larger (P < 0.05), in isolated N. tangutorum patches than in open areas. However, the frequency and abundance of P. australis, and the co-occurrence frequency of the two associate species in isolated N. tangutorum patches and in open areas were the same.

We evaluated the effects of a marine herbivore (i.e. the crab Neohelice granulata) on plant secondary succession in a southwestern Atlantic salt marsh. Field surveys revealed that disturbance-generated bare patches have harsh physical conditions and that their edges suffer higher herbivore pressure compared to the marsh matrix. A factorial experiment demonstrated that asexual expansion of the surrounding plants is the only possible mechanism to re-colonize disturbed patches and that crab exclusion can increase this colonization rate by more than 30 times. Our results show that even in highly stressful environments, herbivores strongly impact marsh structure by regulating patch recovery.

The future of coral reef systems at local, regional and global scales is highly uncertain, which poses a challenge to decision makers in designing appropriate strategies for managing human activities that affect reef resilience. Scenario analysis using simulation models can inform decision making by exploring possible futures under alternative management frameworks. Here, we use a spatially explicit, regional-scale simulation model for coral reefs in the Meso-American Reef system to explore the effects of multiple stressors and disturbances on reef state. Two complementary approaches to scenario analysis help to characterize potential reef responses to the combined impacts of climate and land-use change in the Meso-American Reef region. Sedimentation and nutrification emerge as key factors in decreasing the resilience of reef systems to climate change effects. The average community composition of degraded reef systems exposed to high levels of stress and disturbance tends to be more predictable than community composition on reefs that are subject to lower levels of stress and disturbance because degraded reefs tend to a common composition. This observation applies at both subregional (10(4)-10(5) m) and regional (10(6) m) scales and reflects a finite bound to the effects of degradation on coral reef communities. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Ciliates in surface litter numbered 180-580 g(-1) dry weight, but were reduced by 20-60% in the underlying soils. Testate amoebae numbered 18,000-77,000 g(-1) dry weight in both litter and soil although they were often more abundant in underlying soils. Rotting logs, essential for tree regeneration, supported similar numbers of ciliates, but twice the numbers of testate amoebae. In three epiphytic soils, ciliates numbered 350-550, and testate amoebae 35,000-195,000 g(-1) dry weight of soil. In these soils, 26 species of gymnamoebae, 64 species of ciliates, and 113 species of testate amoebae were found. About 65% of the individuals in ciliate and 45% in testate amoebae populations were small, r-selected taxa. Rain forest soil protozoa have distinct testate amoebae populations, and are characterized by enormous biodiversity, the dominance of acrostome species, the proliferation of Euglypha and Nebela species, and the appearance of aquatic taxa. Ecological succession of ciliates and testate amoebae follows an additive (non-replacement) pattern according to a neutral model. The large numbers of persistent r-selected species respond to ecosystem disturbances by mobilizing quickly to resume the bacterivory necessary to help restore the recovering above-ground plant community.

Under AP, late-acting deleterious mutations accumulate because they confer beneficial effects early in life. Recent studies suggest that the mitochondrial genome is a major player in ageing. It therefore seems plausible that the MA and AP models will be relevant to genomes within the cytoplasm. This possibility has not been considered previously. We explore whether patterns of covariation between fitness and ageing across 25 cytoplasmic lines, sampled from a population of Drosophila melanogaster, are consistent with the genetic associations predicted under MA or AP.

Dominance structures due to competitive hierarchies, with consequences for species richness, have not received as much experimental attention, since their manipulation is a large logistic undertaking. Here the data from a model system based on bryophytes are presented to investigate competition structure in a three-species system. Grown in monocultures, pairwise and three-species mixtures under no and high nitrogen supply, the three moss species responded strongly to treatment conditions. One of them suffered from nitrogen fertilisation and hence performed better in mixtures, where the dominant species provided physical shelter from apparently toxic nitrogen spray. Accordingly, no linear competitive hierarchy emerged and qualitative transitivity remains restricted to the unfertilised treatments. Faciliation also affected other properties of the competition structure. The reciprocity of competition effects could not be observed. Moreover, the performances in three-species mixtures were not well predictable from the knowledge of monocultures and pairwise mixtures because competitive effects were not additive. This had implications for community stability at equilibrium: all two-species systems were stable, both fertilised and unfertilised, while the three-species system was only stable when fertilised. This stability under fertilisation has probably to do with the facilitative effect of the two dominant species on the third. In this experiment, little support for commonly held ideas was found about the way competition in plant communities is structured. On the other hand, this study shows that moss communities are ideal model systems to test predictions of theoretical models concerning properties and consequences of competition in plant communities.",4,2007,191,2,171,184"Norris, WR; Hemesath, LM; Debinski, DM; Farrar, DR","Does bird community composition vary along a disturbance gradient in northeast Iowa, USA, forests?",NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL,Article,"Most previous studies of bird-habitat relationships in midwestern U.S. forests have excluded recently disturbed habitats from consideration.

The study was to investigate whether mild salinity stress could influence the accumulation and reduction of SO2 absorbed and SO2 fumigation could modify the salt ion concentrations in the plant tissues. SO2 fumigation significantly increased sulphur concentration in the shoots, but not in the roots. The SO2 absorbed in the leaves was mostly oxidized into sulphate and little reduced into organic sulphur compounds. NaCl salinity decreased the sulphate concentration in leaves, but did not affect the organic sulphur concentration. There was an antagonistic interaction between SO2 fumigation and NaCl salinity on the concentration of sulphate in the leaves. SO2 fumigation, salinity, and their combination affected the concentrations of Cl-, K+, Na+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the plant tissues Exposure to SO2 increased the K+ concentration in the leaves, but decreased the Cl-, Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations. SO2 fumigation and NaCl salinity had an antagonistic interaction on the concentrations of K+, Cl-, Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the leaf tissue. The Na+ concentration in the youngest fully expanded leaves of the saline plants was decreased by exposure to 441 nl l-1 SO2. Plant tolerance to NaCl salinity may have been enhanced by SO2 fumigation by decreasing Na+ and Cl- concentration and increasing the K+ concentration in the leaves. The antagonistic interactions between SO2 fumigation and NaCl salinity on the SO2 uptake and salt accumulation in the leaves may be responsible for their antagonistic interaction on plant growth.",4,1994,47,4,335,351"LARSEN, BR","SYNERGISTIC EFFECTS OF ACID-RAIN AND (+/-)-2-(2,4-DICHLOROPHENOXY)-PROPANOIC ACID (2,4-DP) ON GROWTH, MINERAL-CONTENT AND STRESS-INDUCED ETHYLENE IN LETTUCE",ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION SERIES A-ECOLOGICAL AND BIOLOGICAL,Article,,4,1986,41,2,179,196"Soudzilovskaia, NA; Douma, JC; Akhmetzhanova, AA; van Bodegom, PM; Cornwell, WK; Moens, EJ; Treseder, KK; Tibbett, M; Wang, YP; Cornelissen, JHC",Global patterns of plant root colonization intensity by mycorrhizal fungi explained by climate and soil chemistry,GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,Article,"AimMost vascular plants on Earth form mycorrhizae, a symbiotic relationship between plants and fungi. Despite the broad recognition of the importance of mycorrhizae for global carbon and nutrient cycling, we do not know how soil and climate variables relate to the intensity of colonization of plant roots by mycorrhizal fungi. Here we quantify the global patterns of these relationships. LocationGlobal. MethodsData on plant root colonization intensities by the two dominant types of mycorrhizal fungi world-wide, arbuscular (4887 plant species in 233 sites) and ectomycorrhizal fungi (125 plant species in 92 sites), were compiled from published studies. Data for climatic and soil factors were extracted from global datasets. For a given mycorrhizal type, we calculated at each site the mean root colonization intensity by mycorrhizal fungi across all potentially mycorrhizal plant species found at the site, and subjected these data to generalized additive model regression analysis with environmental factors as predictor variables. ResultsWe show for the first time that at the global scale the intensity of plant root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi strongly relates to warm-season temperature, frost periods and soil carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, and is highest at sites featuring continental climates with mild summers and a high availability of soil nitrogen. In contrast, the intensity of ectomycorrhizal infection in plant roots is related to soil acidity, soil carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and seasonality of precipitation, and is highest at sites with acidic soils and relatively constant precipitation levels. Main conclusionsWe provide the first quantitative global maps of intensity of mycorrhizal colonization based on environmental drivers, and suggest that environmental changes will affect distinct types of mycorrhizae differently. Future analyses of the potential effects of environmental change on global carbon and nutrient cycling via mycorrhizal pathways will need to take into account the relationships discovered in this study.",3,2015,24,3,371,382"Zheng, ZM; Fu, BJ; Hu, HT; Sun, G","A method to identify the variable ecosystem services relationship across time: a case study on Yanhe Basin, China",LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,Article,"Ecosystem services are increasingly recognized as the foundations of a well-functioning society. Large-scale ecological restoration projects have been implemented around China with the goal of restoring and sustaining ecosystem services, especially in vulnerable semi-arid regions where soil and water resources are most stressed due to historic human activities. The relationships among ecosystem services are often driven by land-use changes. It is necessary to develop an applicable method to explore the relationships between ecosystem services and driving factors over time. We selected the Yanhe Basin on China's Loess Plateau as the study area, which has experienced a large-scale Grain for Green Project (GGP), and quantified four ecosystem services (soil conservation, water retention, water yield, and crop production). The results of this study show that different trends have occurred for ecosystem services during 2000-2008. We found potential tradeoffs between soil conservation and water yield. Synergies may exist among water retention and soil conservation/water yield. Two types of preconditions were pointed out in the analysis process to define the potential relationships among ecosystem service variables. The correspondence analysis was used to explore its intrinsic linkage and its variations among ecosystemservices, land uses, and spatial locations. It suggests that the intensities of the ecosystem services provided by most of land uses and the internal proportion of regulating service to provision service in a sub-basin has been changed by GGP, but the relative spatial patterns of ecosystem services are still being maintained in entire basin scale from 1980 to 2008.",3,2014,29,10,1689,1696"Cubaynes, S; MacNulty, DR; Stahler, DR; Quimby, KA; Smith, DW; Coulson, T",Density-dependent intraspecific aggression regulates survival in northern Yellowstone wolves (Canis lupus),JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,Article,"Understanding the population dynamics of top-predators is essential to assess their impact on ecosystems and to guide their management. Key to this understanding is identifying the mechanisms regulating vital rates. Determining the influence of density on survival is necessary to understand the extent to which human-caused mortality is compensatory or additive. In wolves (Canis lupus), empirical evidence for density-dependent survival is lacking. Dispersal is considered the principal way in which wolves adjust their numbers to prey supply or compensate for human exploitation. However, studies to date have primarily focused on exploited wolf populations, in which density-dependent mechanisms are likely weak due to artificially low wolf densities. Using 13years of data on 280 collared wolves in Yellowstone National Park, we assessed the effect of wolf density, prey abundance and population structure, as well as winter severity, on age-specific survival in two areas (prey-rich vs. prey-poor) of the national park. We further analysed cause-specific mortality and explored the factors driving intraspecific aggression in the prey-rich northern area of the park. Overall, survival rates decreased during the study. In northern Yellowstone, density dependence regulated adult survival through an increase in intraspecific aggression, independent of prey availability. In the interior of the park, adult survival was less variable and density-independent, despite reduced prey availability. There was no effect of prey population structure in northern Yellowstone, or of winter severity in either area. Survival was similar among yearlings and adults, but lower for adults older than 6years. Our results indicate that density-dependent intraspecific aggression is a major driver of adult wolf survival in northern Yellowstone, suggesting intrinsic density-dependent mechanisms have the potential to regulate wolf populations at high ungulate densities. When low prey availability or high removal rates maintain wolves at lower densities, limited inter-pack interactions may prevent density-dependent survival, consistent with our findings in the interior of the park.",3,2014,83,6,1344,1356"Palacios-Agundez, I; de Manuel, BF; Rodriguez-Loinaz, G; Pena, L; Ametzaga-Arregi, I; Alday, JG; Casado-Arzuaga, I; Madariaga, I; Arana, X; Onaindia, M",Integrating stakeholders' demands and scientific knowledge on ecosystem services in landscape planning,LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,Article,"The conflict between conservation and timber production is shifting in regions such as Biscay (Basque Country, northern Spain) where planted forests are no longer profitable without public subsidies and environmentalist claim that public subsidies should be reoriented to the regeneration of natural forest. This paper develops an approach that integrates scientific knowledge and stakeholders' demands to provide decision-making guidelines for the development of new landscape planning strategies while considering ecosystem services. First, a participatory process was conducted to develop a community vision for the region's sustainable future considering the opportunities and constrains provided by the landscape and its ecosystems. In the participatory process forest management was considered an important driver for the region`s landscape development and forest multi-functionality was envisioned as a feasible attractive alternative. The participatory process identified a knowledge gap on the synergies and trade-offs between biodiversity and carbon storage and how these depend on different forest types. Second, to study the existing synergies and trade-offs between biodiversity and carbon storage and disentangle the identified knowledge gap, a GIS-based research was conducted based on spatially explicit indicators. Our spatial analysis results showed that natural forests' contribution to biodiversity and carbon storage is higher than that of the plantations with exotic species in the region. The results from the spatial analysis converged with those from the participatory process in the suitability of promoting, where possible and appropriate, natural forest ecosystems restoration.

Here, we hypothesize that predator prey relationships vary spatially in association with underlying physical ocean conditions, leading to observable changes in demographic rates, such as reproduction. To test this hypothesis, we quantified spatio-temporal variability in hydrographic conditions, krill, and forage fish to model predator (seabird) demographic responses over 18 years (1990-2007). We used principal component analysis and spatial correlation maps to assess coherence among ocean conditions, krill, and forage fish, and generalized additive models to quantify interannual variability in seabird breeding success relative to prey abundance. The first principal component of four hydrographic measurements yielded an index that partitioned ""warm/weak upwelling"" and ""cool/strong upwelling"" years. Partitioning of krill and forage fish time series among shelf and oceanic regions yielded spatially explicit indicators of prey availability. Krill abundance within the oceanic region was remarkably consistent between years, whereas krill over the shelf showed marked interannual fluctuations in relation to ocean conditions. Anchovy abundance varied on the shelf, and was greater in years of strong stratification, weak upwelling and warmer temperatures. Spatio-temporal variability of juvenile forage fish co-varied strongly with each other and with krill, but was weakly correlated with hydrographic conditions. Demographic responses between seabirds and prey availability revealed spatially variable associations indicative of the dynamic nature of ""predator habitat"" relationships.

We report the severe impact of a previously undocumented introduced predator on the endangered, migratory swift parrot (Lathamus discolor). Sugar gliders (Petaurus breviceps), a supposedly benign introduced species, were detected acting as a major opportunistic predator of cavity-nesting birds. We assessed the intensity and geographical extent of sugar glider predation and investigated whether habitat loss exacerbated predation risk to swift parrots. Location Tasmania, Australia. Methods We monitored nests of swift parrots for 3 years with motion-activated cameras. We used bioclimatic modelling to predict the potential distribution of introduced sugar gliders across the study area and assessed the predation risk to swift parrots and other threatened birds in the region using nest-survival analysis. Results Daily survival of nests in areas where sugar gliders occurred was mean 0.97, which equated to a true likelihood of 0.17 for a nest to survive the 60-day nesting period. No nests failed on an offshore island where sugar gliders were shown to be absent. Most cases (83.3%) of glider predation resulted in the death of the adult female parrot. On the Tasmanian mainland, there was a positive relationship between nest survival and increasing mature forest cover at the landscape scale. Main conclusions Predation risk varied dramatically across the breeding range of swift parrots, depending on the presence of sugar gliders. Offshore islands are an important refuge for swift parrots because sugar gliders are absent. However, islands are vulnerable, and our bioclimatic model shows that they are bioclimatically suitable for sugar gliders.

The investigation of microbe-microbe interactions is essential for understanding the in vivo activities of commensal and pathogenic microorganisms. Candida albicans, a polymorphic fungus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative bacterium, are two opportunistic pathogens that interact in various polymicrobial infections in humans. To determine how P. aeruginosa affects the physiology of C. albicans and vice versa, we compared the proteomes of each species in mixed biofilms versus single-species biofilms. In addition, extracellular proteins were analyzed. We observed that, in mixed biofilms, both species showed differential expression of virulence proteins, multidrug resistance-associated proteins, proteases and cell defense, stress and iron-regulated proteins. Furthermore, in mixed biofilms, both species displayed an increase in mutability compared with monospecific biofilms. This characteristic was correlated with the downregulation of enzymes conferring protection against DNA oxidation. In mixed biofilms, P. aeruginosa regulates its production of various molecules involved in quorum sensing and induces the production of virulence factors (pyoverdine, rhamnolipids and pyocyanin), which are major contributors to the ability of this bacterium to cause disease. Overall, our results indicate that interspecies competition between these opportunistic pathogens enhances the production of virulence factors and increases mutability and thus can alter the course of host-pathogen interactions in polymicrobial infections.",3,2014,8,10,1974,1988"Clark, ES; Pompini, M; da Cunha, LM; Wedekind, C",Maternal and paternal contributions to pathogen resistance dependent on development stage in a whitefish (Salmonidae),FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,Article,"It is often assumed that maternal and paternal contributions to offspring phenotype change over the lifetime of an individual. However, studies on parental effects typically suffer from the problems that heritabilities and maternal environmental effects are difficult to separate, and that both may depend on environmental factors and developmental stage. In order to experimentally disentangle maternal from paternal contributions and the likely effects of developmental stage from ecological effects, we sampled a natural population of the whitefish Coregonus palaea, used gametes for full-factorial in vitro fertilizations, raised over 10000 of the resulting offspring singly at controlled conditions, and exposed them at different points during embryonic development to one of two strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens that differed in their virulence characteristics (only one caused mortality, while both delayed hatching and reduced growth). Vulnerability to infection increased markedly over embryo development. This change coincided with a distinct shift in the importance of maternal to additive genetic effects on survival. Timing of exposure also affected the variance components for hatching time and larval length, but in a less consistent direction than the variance components for mortality. No significant genetic variation was found for any reaction norms across time points of exposure, indicating a uniformity among genotypes in how susceptibility changed over development. Phenotypes were also typically correlated across time points, which could constrain the evolution of the reaction norms.

We also investigated the relative importance of landscape versus local community attributes in mediating the effects of S.secundatum invasion on the community. Location Four hundred kilometres of the coastline of south-eastern Australia. Methods We compared the diversity, composition and recruitment of resident vegetation in 32 invaded and 32 non-invaded forest stands across an anthropogenic land use gradient. Local disturbance and environmental attributes of the forest (e.g. fire severity, litter abundance, canopy openness, vegetation structure) and adjacent landscape matrix (e.g. cover of forest, urban and agricultural land) were measured in detail at each site. Results Invasion was associated with substantial local extinctions of native plant species (i.e. 83% fewer species in invaded sites), altered community compositions and an 85% reduction in rates of woody plant recruitment. Local disturbances and environmental attributes of forest stands and adjacent landscape matrix were similar between invaded and native sites. Invasion caused a twofold increase in litter biomass, which we hypothesize is the primary mechanism by which the invader excludes native species. Landscape modification had no effect on the diversity of adjacent swamp forest. There was no interactive effect of landscape modification and invasion on the native community; species losses in response to invasion were high regardless of the condition of the adjacent matrix.

We mechanistically studied the interaction between the sediment-stabilizing seagrass Zostera noltii and the bioturbating and sediment-destabilizing lugworm Arenicola marina, which sometimes co-occur for prolonged periods. We investigated (1) if the negative sediment destabilization effect of A. marina on Z. noltii might be counteracted by positive biogeochemical effects of bioirrigation (burrow flushing) by A. marina in sulfide-rich sediments, and (2) if previously observed nutrient release by A. marina bioirrigation could affect seagrasses. We tested the individual and combined effects of A. marina presence and high porewater sulfide concentrations (induced by organic matter addition) on seagrass biomass in a full factorial lab experiment. Contrary to our expectations, we did not find an effect of A. marina on porewater sulfide concentrations. A. marina activities affected the seagrass physically as well as by pumping nutrients, mainly ammonium and phosphate, from the porewater to the surface water, which promoted epiphyte growth on seagrass leaves in our experimental set-up.

Principal component analysis indicated that individually recorded behaviors were described by two personality axes: the first reflecting boldness, exploration, and aggression and the second tendency to freeze. These personality components, as well as the originally recorded behaviors, were statistically significantly repeatable over time. The latter PC, but not the first one, was statistically significantly heritable, though at low level (h (2) = 0.142 +/- 0.096).

Impacts can be caused by local stressors which can be managed, such as eutrophication, and by global stressors that cannot be managed, such as climate change. Cumulative impact maps typically assume that there are no interactive effects between stressors on biodiversity. However, the benefits of managing the ecosystem are affected by interactions between stressors. Our aim was to determine whether the assumption of no interactions in impact maps leads to incorrect identification of sites for management. Location General, Australasia. Methods We used the additive effects model to incorporate the effects of interactions into an interactive impact map. Seagrass meadows in Australasia threatened by a local stressor, nutrient inputs, and a global stressor, warming, were used as a case study. The reduction in the impact index was quantified for reductions in the nutrient stressor. We examined the outcomes for three scenarios: no interactions, antagonistic interactions or synergistic interactions. Results Cumulative impact maps imply that reducing a local stressor will give equivalent reductions in the impact index everywhere, regardless of spatial variability in a global stressor. We show that reductions in the impact index were greatest in refuges from warming if there was an antagonistic interaction between stressors, and greatest in areas of high warming stress if there was a synergistic interaction. Reducing the nutrient stressor in refuges from warming always reduced the impact index, regardless of the interaction.

Both lead to a loss of biodiversity and alter species interactions, which may imperil vital ecosystem processes such as seed dispersal by frugivores. Reponses of frugivores to disturbance are often linked to their specialization on certain habitats or resources. Yet, it is poorly understood how habitat loss and plant invasion structure interactions between plants and different habitat or feeding guilds. Here we investigated whether visitation rates of frugivores change guild-specifically with increasing habitat loss and invasion level in a heterogeneous subtropical landscape. In 756 h of observations, we recorded 1446 plant-frugivore interactions among 18 plant species and 42 avian frugivore species. Visitation rates of forest specialists decreased with increasing habitat loss, but not with changes in invasion level. In contrast forest generalists and forest visitors were unaffected by either driver. Similarly, obligate frugivores that overall showed a generalized fruit choice were unaffected by habitat loss and changes in invasion level. Contrary, visitation rates of specialized partial and opportunistic frugivores decreased with higher invasion level. Importantly, the negative effect of plant invasion on partial frugivores was more pronounced as habitat loss in the same study site increased, indicating a synergistic effect of the two drivers. The implications of our study are twofold: first, frugivores respond guild-specifically to habitat loss and plant invasion. Thereby forest dependency is mainly related to habitat loss, and degree of frugivory mainly related to plant invasion. Forest generalists and obligate frugivores in turn may play a key-role for forest regeneration in disturbed forest landscapes.

Eelgrass exhibited a statistically significant linear increase in relative growth with increasing NH4 concentration (range from 5 to 1000 mu M); in contrast, there was no relationship between relative growth rate and increasing NO3 concentration. After 14 d there were no indications of plant mortality associated with NH4 or NO3. Leaf growth metrics exhibited strong statistically significant linear relationships with increasing water temperature (temperature range 4-25 degrees C), indicating broad thermal tolerance. In the factorial experiment, triplicate plants were exposed to 3 temperatures (10, 18 and 25 C) and 3 nitrate concentrations (10,30 and 100 mu M). Most metrics (leaf elongation, growth, relative growth, wasting index) exhibited a statistically significant temperature effect but no nutrient concentration effect, indicating the importance of temperature on metabolic rates. Plants at 18 and 25 C had significantly more wasting disease than plants at 10 C. Tissue delta N-15 and C:N values exhibited significant nutrient concentration and temperature effects, indicating that both factors influenced how much NO3 was incorporated into the tissues.

Both predators and parasites can affect host traits, such as growth rates and behavior, and these effects may in part be mediated through shared physiological pathways (e.g. the glucocorticoid stress hormone, corticosterone [CORT]). Here, we examined the effects of trematode parasites (Digena: Echinostomatidae) and predator (larval odonate) exposure on larvae of two amphibian species (Rana sylvatica and R. clamitans) in laboratory experiments. First, we measured behavior and CORT responses of tadpoles exposed to predator chemical cue in combination with parasite cue or under direct exposure to parasites. We then measured the combined effects of predator cue and parasite infection on survival and traits. Evidence for effects of parasite cue in our study was equivocal, but we found novel interactive effects of parasites and predators on larval frogs. Parasites and predators had antagonistic effects on CORT, behavior, and morphology, and negative synergistic effects on development. In addition, parasite infection and predator cues additively reduced activity levels of both species and growth in wood frogs. Negative effects of parasite infection on survival and traits were dose-dependent for both species, although wood frogs generally experienced stronger effects of infection than green frogs. Our results emphasize the importance of considering effects of parasites as well as predators, since both can have strong effects on survival and the combination can have both additive and non-additive effects on key traits.

Decades of research have provided a litany of examples of the potential for shrubs as nurse plants for establishment of desirable species, especially in water-limited environments. However, interactions with the existing understory community may alter the outcome of interactions between shrubs and understory plants. A manipulative experiment was conducted to disentangle interactions between a native forb species (Penstemon palmeri A. Gray), a native shrub (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.), and a diverse understory of exotic and native forbs and grasses in a semi-arid shrubland of Northern Utah, USA. Seedlings of P. palmeri were transplanted in a factorial design: (1) beneath shrub canopies or into their interspaces and (2) with understory interactions retained or removed. Transplant survival was tracked for roughly 1 year. Shrubs appeared to facilitate P. palmeri survival while interactions with the existing understory community were equivalently negative, leading to overall neutral interactions. Further, positive shrub interactions and negative understory interactions appeared to operate independently and simultaneously. While the debate over the importance of facilitation and competition in driving plant community dynamics continues, our observations strongly suggest that both have considerable effects on plant establishment in A. tridentata communities.

The stress gradient hypothesis predicts that under physiologically stressful environmental conditions abiotic factors shape range edges while in less stressful environments negative biotic interactions are more important. Butterflies provide a suitable system to test this hypothesis since larvae of most species depend on biotic interactions with a specific set of host plants, which in turn can shape patterns of occurrence and distribution. Here we modelled the distribution of 92 butterfly and 136 host plant species with three different modelling algorithms, using distribution data from the Swiss biodiversity monitoring scheme at a 1 x 1 km spatial resolution. By comparing the ensemble prediction for each butterfly species and the corresponding host plant(s), we assessed potential constraints imposed by host plant availability on distribution of butterflies at their distributional limits along the main environmental gradient, which closely parallels an elevational gradient. Our results indicate that host limitation does not play a role at the lower limit. At the upper limit 50% of butterfly species have a higher elevational limit than their primary host plant, and 33% have upper elevational limits that exceed the limits of both primary and secondary hosts. We conclude that host plant limitation was not relevant to butterfly distributional limits in less stressful environments and that distributions are more likely limited by climate, land use or antagonistic biotic interactions. Obligatory dependency of butterflies on their host plants, however, seems to represent an important limiting factor for the distribution of some species towards the cold, upper end of the environmental gradient, suggesting that biotic factors can shape ranges in stressful environments. Thus, predictions by the stress gradient hypothesis were not always applicable.",3,2014,37,3,301,308"Olsen, K; Ritson-Williams, R; Paul, VJ; Ross, C",Combined effects of macroalgal presence and elevated temperature on the early life-history stages of a common Caribbean coral,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,Article,"Both global- and regional-scale stressors are contributing to the decline of corals on reefs across the planet. Even though many factors affect corals, we have very little data on the relationship between multiple co-occurring stressors and their compounding effects on these critical ecosystem engineers. We provide evidence that under short-term exposure, the presence of the brown alga Dictyota menstrualis has direct negative consequences for coral survival and recruitment, while seawater elevated to + 3.5 degrees C causes sub-lethal stress and compromises coral health. Three life-history stages (larvae, 6 wk-old juveniles [similar to 0.15 cm(2)], and 1-2 yr-old colonies [0.8-45 cm(2)]) of the common Caribbean coral Porites astreoides were exposed to each stressor alone and in combination. Exposure to D. menstrualis reduced the survival of P. astreoides larvae and 6 wk-old juveniles by similar to 40% and caused partial mortality in 1-2 yr-old colonies. Elevated temperature did not cause mortality, but induced sub-lethal stress that was disparate among coral life-history stages. These stressors in combination predominately impacted corals in an independent manner. However, extended exposure resulted in a synergistic enhancement of oxidative damage (lipid peroxidation) in P. astreoides larvae. Our results suggest that benthic macroalgae can greatly inhibit coral recruitment, and this pressure combined with rising sea-surface temperatures re presents a significant threat to the health of coral reef ecosystems. These results highlight the importance of local- and global-scale stressors acting in concert to impact coral demographics during critical early life-history stages.",3,2014,509,,181,+"Traveset, A; Richardson, DM",Mutualistic Interactions and Biological Invasions,"ANNUAL REVIEW OF ECOLOGY, EVOLUTION, AND SYSTEMATICS, VOL 45",Review; Book Chapter,"Mutualisms structure ecosystems and mediate their functioning. They also enhance invasions of many alien species. Invasions disrupt native mutualisms, often leading to population declines, reduced biodiversity, and altered ecosystem functioning. Focusing on three main types of mutualisms (pollination, seed dispersal, and plant-microbial symbioses) and drawing on examples from different ecosystems and from species-and community-level studies, we review the key mechanisms whereby such positive interactions mediate invasions and are in turn influenced by invasions. High interaction generalization is ""the norm"" in most systems, allowing alien species to infiltrate recipient communities. We identify traits that influence invasiveness (e.g., selfing capacity in plants, animal behavioral traits) or invasibility (e.g., partner choice in mycorrhizas/rhizobia) through mutualistic interactions. Mutualistic disruptions due to invasions are pervasive, and subsequent cascading effects are also widespread.

To understand how song responds to selection, it is vital to determine the extent to which variation in song learning and neuroanatomy is attributable to genetic variation, environmental conditions, or their interactions. Using a partial cross fostering design with an experimental stressor, we quantified the heritability of song structure and key brain nuclei in the song control system of the zebra finch and the genotype-by-environment (G x E) interactions. Neuroanatomy and song structure both showed low levels of heritability and are unlikely to be under selection as indicators of genetic quality. HVC, in particular, was almost entirely under environmental control. G x E interaction was important for brain development and may provide a mechanism by which additive genetic variation is maintained, which in turn may promote sexual selection through female choice.

In arid and semi-arid environments, this is challenging because animal populations show considerable spatial and temporal variation. An effective approach in such systems is to examine both broad-scale and long-term data. We used this approach to investigate the distribution of small mammal species in semi-arid mallee' vegetation in south-eastern Australia. First, we examined broad-scale data collected at 280 sites across the Murray Mallee region. We used generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) to examine four hypotheses concerning factors that influence the distribution of individual mammal species at this scale: vegetation structure, floristic diversity, topography and recent rainfall. Second, we used long-term data from a single conservation reserve (surveyed from 1997 to 2012) to examine small mammal responses to rainfall over a period spanning a broad range of climatic conditions, including record high rainfall in 2011. Small mammal distributions were strongly associated with vegetation structure and rainfall patterns, but the relative importance of these drivers was species-specific. The distribution of the mallee ningaui Ningaui yvonneae, for example, was largely determined by the cover of hummock grass; whereas the occurrence of the western pygmy possum Cercartetus concinnus was most strongly associated with above-average rainfall. Further, the combination of both broad-scale and long-term data provided valuable insights. Bolam's mouse Pseudomys bolami was uncommon during the broad-scale survey, but long-term surveys showed that it responds positively to above-average rainfall. Conceptual models developed for small mammals in temperate and central arid Australia, respectively, were not, on their own, adequate to account for the distributional patterns of species in this semi-arid ecosystem. Species-specific variation in the relative importance of different drivers was more effectively explained by qualitative differences in life-history attributes among species.",3,2013,38,7,786,797"Clark, ES; Wilkins, LGE; Wedekind, C",MHC class I expression dependent on bacterial infection and parental factors in whitefish embryos (Salmonidae),MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,Article,"Ecological conditions can influence not only the expression of a phenotype, but also the heritability of a trait. As such, heritable variation for a trait needs to be studied across environments. We have investigated how pathogen challenge affects the expression of MHC genes in embryos of the lake whitefish Coregonus palaea. In order to experimentally separate paternal (i.e. genetic) from maternal and environmental effects, and determine whether and how stress affects the heritable variation for MHC expression, embryos were produced in full-factorial in vitro fertilizations, reared singly, and exposed at 208 degree days (late-eyed stage) to either one of two strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens that differ in their virulence characteristics (one increased mortality, while both delayed hatching time). Gene expression was assessed 48h postinoculation, and virulence effects of the bacterial infection were monitored until hatching. We found no evidence of MHC class II expression at this stage of development. MHC class I expression was markedly down-regulated in reaction to both pseudomonads. While MHC expression could not be linked to embryo survival, the less the gene was expressed, the earlier the embryos hatched within each treatment group, possibly due to trade-offs between immune function and developmental rate or further factors that affect both hatching timing and MHC expression. We found significant additive genetic variance for MHC class I expression in some treatments. That is, changes in pathogen pressures could induce rapid evolution in MHC class I expression. However, we found no additive genetic variance in reaction norms in our study population.",3,2013,22,20,5256,5269"Wolf, AT; Nugues, MM",Synergistic effects of algal overgrowth and corallivory on Caribbean reef-building corals,ECOLOGY,Article,"Indirect biotic interactions play a crucial role in structuring ecological communities, but many of these interactions have not been explored. Algal competition and corallivory are two major stressors contributing to the decline of coral reefs. Here, we provide the first evidence of algal-induced corallivory and synergistic effects between the two stressors on corals. When corals (Montastraea faveolata) were placed in contact with algae (Halimeda opuntia) together with corallivorous fireworms (Hermodice carunculata) in aquaria, corals suffered high tissue mortality. This mortality was reduced in the presence of algae only, and no mortality occurred in the presence of fireworms only or when excluding both algae and fireworms. These findings were supported by field observations showing a predominance of fireworms inside algae contacting live corals, and by an in situ experiment demonstrating higher coral mortality in contact with algae left undisturbed than with algae from which all mobile epifauna were periodically removed. Among the main contributing mechanisms, we suggest that algal contact produces decaying coral tissue that attracts the corallivore and enhances its aggregation behavior.

The interaction with external stressors like fragmentation could exacerbate the effects of internal ecosystem drivers like herbivory, with distinct implications for ecosystem management. We used manipulative field experiments to assess these interactive effects in two Posidonia oceanica seagrass meadows. We monitored replicated plots in small and large patches in two meadows suffering fragmentation with and without herbivores (using exclusion cages) to test whether fragment size and herbivory could act together to alter ecosystem functioning. We measured changes in defoliation rates, primary production, canopy height and nutrient content in all plots after 4months of herbivore exclusion. Our results show that herbivores increased defoliation rates resulting in reduced primary production, nutrient content and canopy structure (canopy height). Patch size (fragment) on its own also reduced primary production, nutrient content and canopy structure. We also observed significant additive interactions between herbivores and fragmentation on canopy structure and production responses. In addition, small patches showed nutrient limitation but were able to accumulate more carbohydrate reserves, probably due to a higher light availability. This may explain why small patches can persist under significant herbivore pressure. Synthesis. While fragmentation has already been identified as an important external agent of seagrass decline, the combination of fragmentation and herbivory can seriously exacerbate structural losses and affect primary production, profoundly compromising the role of seagrasses as habitat-forming ecosystems.

In this study we determined the effect of binary mixtures of cadmium and phenanthrene on the reproduction of Folsomia candida and investigated the cellular mechanisms underlying this response. Mixture toxicity modeling showed an antagonistic deviation from concentration addition for reproduction effects of the mixtures. Subsequent transcriptional response analysis was done using five mixtures at the modeled 50 % effect level for reproduction. The transcription profiles of 86 high throughput RT-qPCR assays were studied by means of partial least squares regression analysis. The first and second principal components (PCs) were correlated with global responses to cadmium and phenanthrene, while correlations with the mixture treatments were found in the higher PCs. Specifically associated with the mixture treatments were a biotransformation phase II gene, four mitochondrial related genes and a gene involved in the biosynthesis of antioxidant selenoproteins. Membrane integrity related gene inductions were correlated with the single phenanthrene treatment but not with the mixtures. Immune and inflammatory response assays did not correlate with any of the mixtures. These results suggest moderated oxidative stress, a higher mitochondrial maintenance and less compromised membrane function in the mixture exposed samples compared to the separate cadmium or phenanthrene exposures. The antagonism found for inhibition of reproduction may partially originate from these differences.

The addition of cicada carcasses increased mean plant biomass by 61 % compared to non-supplemented plants, while competition decreased mean plant biomass by 44 % compared to plants grown without competition; these effects were additive. In comparison, nutrient use efficiency decreased in fertilized plants (cicada-supplemented plants showed 20 % greater foliage nitrogen concentrations compared to non-supplemented plants), but was not significantly affected by the plant's competitive environment. In addition, cicada supplementation did not significantly increase the biomass asymmetry in competing pairs of plants.

We assessed the influence of coastal land use and climate change (specifically sea level rise) on the spatial distribution of nests within the largest loggerhead Caretta caretta marine turtle rookery in the Atlantic Ocean, at Melbourne Beach, Florida, from 1986 to 2006. We generated a multiple regression model based on climate change, sea-level rise and land use that describes 47% of the spatial variation in loggerhead nesting.

We recorded from 16 (shrubby grassland following forest fire) to 27 (selectively logged forest) woody plant species per site and 37 species in total (gamma diversity). Additive partitioning showed that alpha diversity contributed 59% to gamma diversity and beta diversity only 41%.

Ordination analyses confirmed this finding: species composition of unlogged, selectively logged and intensively logged forest sites was quite similar. Results suggest that (1) woody vegetation, at least, of the Semi-arid Chaco is quite tolerant to traditional modes of land use and that (2) conservation of this vegetation as a whole must include not only ""pristine"" sites varying in edaphic conditions but also sites varying in land use and management histories.

We employed dynamic occupancy modeling to compare the strength of local habitat variables and metrics of landscape patterns as drivers of metapopulation dynamics for a vulnerable, high-elevation species in a naturally fragmented landscape. Repeat surveys of Bicknell's thrush Catharus bicknelli presence/non-detection were conducted at 88 sites across Vermont, USA in 2006 and 2007. We used an organism-based approach, such that at each site we measured important local-scale habitat characteristics and quantified landscape-scale features using a predictive habitat model for this species. We performed a principal component analysis on both the local and landscape features to reduce dimensionality. We estimated site occupancy, colonization, and extinction probabilities while accounting for imperfect detection. Univariate, additive, and interaction models of local habitat and landscape context were ranked using AICc scores. Both local and landscape scales were important in determining changes in occupancy patterns. An interaction between scales was detected for occupancy dynamics indicating that the relationship of the parameters to local-scale habitat conditions can change depending on the landscape context and vice versa. An increase in both landscape- and local-scale habitat quality increased occupancy and colonization probability while decreasing extinction risk. Colonization and extinction were both more strongly influenced by local habitat quality relative to landscape patterns. We also identified clear, qualitative thresholds for landscape-scale features.

The survey showed that drift algae varied considerably between sites and sampling times, and sites experienced average loads of 0.4 to 0.8 kg fresh wt m(-2) and extreme loads up to 2.5 kg fresh wt m(-2). In contrast, invasive snails were constantly abundant at all sites at all collection times (mean abundance: 489 snails m(-2)). In the laboratory experiment, drift algae caused increased shoot mortality and leaf loss rate, and suppressed the formation of new nodes. Drift algae also decreased the depth of the sulphide horizon in the sediment and the oxygen concentration in the water column at night, suggesting increased risk of hypoxia. Invasive snails reduced the biomass of H. ovalis leaves and roots, increased leaf plastochrone interval and decreased the depth of the sulphide horizon. Finally, elevated temperature increased leaf loss and reduced leaf biomass, and, in the presence of drift algae, also reduced the length of the 2nd inter node.

These relationships were examined by placing red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst.), adults in flasks at increasing densities and monitoring the changes in volatile chemical emission over time. Only certain chemicals were quantified: methyl benzoquinone, ethyl benzoquinone and 4,8-dimethyldecanal, all of which are known to impact the biology of T. castaneum. The flasks were used as sources for both quantification of the chemicals and for bioassays. Additional bioassays were conducted with synthetic 4,8-dimethyldecanal, a known aggregation pheromone component, to evaluate attraction with respect to population density. Tribolium castaneum density affected both the release of volatile chemicals and the responses of conspecifics to those chemicals. The results indicated that while there were important effects of beetle density on chemical emission and response, none of the chemicals evaluated emerged as promising synergists to the current aggregation pheromone 4,8-dimethyldecanal.

Previous studies based on the analysis of aerial photography reported an increase in woody plant cover on these flood plains, apparently associated with changed fire regimes, increased rainfall and possibly increased atmospheric CO2. In opposition to this woody vegetation encroachment past high densities of feral buffalo in the 1960 to mid 1980s changed the hydrology of the KNP flood plains, allowing increased penetration of saltwater causing extensive death of Melaleuca forests. Climate change has increased sea levels and there is concern that this will threaten the freshwater ecosystems of KNP. We hypothesized that Melaleuca forests that were previously impacted by high densities of feral buffalo have continued to decline because of salinization driven by sea level rise. We examined this hypothesis by overlaying georeferenced aerial photography taken in 1964, 1984 and 2004 in a geographic information environment, and then constructing generalized linear fixed effects and mixed effects models to rank the statistical strength of different drivers of Melaleuca forest contraction. We found that there has been a 5% overall contraction of Melaleuca forests over the last 50 years on our study sites, although the amount of contraction varied both geographically and temporally. The amount of Melaleuca forest contraction was greatest during the 1984-2004 interval, when buffalo densities were low. Contraction was greatest on the Melaleuca forest edges, at low-lying sites, and where high densities of buffalo were apparent in 1964. These results suggest the enduring legacy effect of past buffalo damage will amplify the effects of sea level rise on the flood plains of KNP.",3,2010,35,8,898,905"Vaidyanathan, S; Krishnaswamy, J; Kumar, NS; Dhanwatey, H; Dhanwatey, P; Karanth, KU",Patterns of tropical forest dynamics and human impacts: Views from above and below the canopy,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,Article,"Tropical forests are influenced by regional and global bio-climatic processes as well as local anthropogenic disturbances. Most studies have ignored the synergistic influence of bio-physical processes operating at large spatial scales and local human use on forest vegetation and fauna. Assessments of forest condition change using time-series of remotely sensed data need to be supported by measurements under the canopy. The Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) in India is a protected area that has a long history of human resource extraction and settlements. Like much of South Asia. it has undergone major shifts in rainfall in the last hundred years. We examine trends in forest greenness over two and half decades and assess spatial patterns in rates of change. We also analyze ground based measurements of human impacts on flora and fauna. Trends in forest canopy greenness show two distinct phases: a period of decline from 1980s to mid-90s, followed by a recovery. These trends are a function of initial greenness and are best explained by prevailing climatic regimes, feed-backs from human use, and park management practices and protection. Negative impacts to flora and fauna on the ground were, however, wide-spread during the recovery period and are influenced by proximity to nearest settlement as well as combined distance from all settlements. Remotely sensed data cannot effectively detect these processes under the canopy.

Most broadleaved trees were shorter than the median crown-base height (H (CB)) of the conifer trees. Estimates of the maximum height (H (max)) of the conifer trees were greater than those of the broadleaved trees. Crown damage had significant negative effects on maximum height of the conifer trees. Crown damage was observed for 72.8-88.7% of the conifer trees, and severe types of damage such as stem breakage and top die-back were the most predominant. The H (max) of the damaged conifer trees was 16-17% shorter than that of the intact trees and as much as 16-28% shorter than the potential maximum height estimated from the diameter-height relationship of the tallest intact trees.

Many population-level responses to climate change have been shown, yet few studies have addressed the additive and/or relative impact of environmental and anthropogenic influences on seabird populations. Using a mixed model approach, we analyzed the trends in plot counts of common murres (Uria aalge) from a Low Arctic colony at Cape St. Mary's, Newfoundland, across 26 years (1980-2006). We tested for associations between population change and various environmental and anthropogenic covariates: water temperature, winter North Atlantic Oscillation, hunting mortality, oil pollution, by-catch in fishing gear, and visitor disturbance. The number of murres occupying central plots decreased from 1980 to 1989 and increased from 1990 to 2006. Annual changes in the population were negatively associated with the estimated number of murres killed in the Newfoundland murre hunt and the high numbers killed in the early 1980s likely caused the observed population decline. The large number of gillnets set in Newfoundland waters during the 1980s, and associated incidence of drowning through by-catch, probably also contributed to the observed decline. Though a centennially significant cold-water perturbation in 1991 forced a regime shift in pelagic food webs, the effect of ocean climate variability on the population was not obvious.

Here, we evaluate the contribution of two spatial levels [transects (100 m x 2 m) and sections within transects (5 m x 2 m)] on the local termite assemblage of a continuous mixed secondary lowland rainforest in southeast Cameroon. Standardized 100 m x 2 m transects were run in five vegetation types to cover more of the heterogeneity of this forest. The additive partitioning of the species richness of all species, soil- and wood-feeder species was statistically tested with sample-based randomization. The average species richness per transect (61) was the highest ever recorded. The section scale significantly influenced the observed species richness of all groups. This suggests that physical complexity and heterogeneity exist on a small scale within each transect and create a variety of microhabitats for different termites. Still, soil-feeder species were less influenced by this scale than wood-feeder species. Although different vegetation types were sampled, transect scale did not enhance observed termite species diversity. Overall, as a wide variety and high density of microhabitats is inherent to large primary or regenerating forests, conservation programmes should focus on interconnecting large tropical rainforest blocks in Central Africa to maintain biodiversity hot spots of termites and optimal ecosystem functioning.",3,2008,46,1,5,18"Stangeland, T; Remberg, SF; Lye, KA",Antioxidants in some Ugandan fruits,AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Article,"Several studies indicate that a plant-based diet protects against the development of some serious diseases.

Multiple stressors are often present in the habitat, and interactions among these can magnify injury to biota. This raises the possibility that the additive or synergistic impact of these stressors may be the underlying cause of amphibian declines. Effective management for the restoration of amphibian populations requires the identification of causal factors contributing to their declines. A systematic approach to determine causality is especially important because initial impressions may be misleading or ambiguous. In addition, the evaluation of amphibian populations requires consideration of a broader spatial scale than commonly used in regulatory monitoring. We describe a systematic three-tiered approach to determine causality in amphibian declines and deformities. Tier I includes an evaluation of historic databases and extant data and would involve a desktop synopsis of the status of various stressors as well as site visits. Tier 2 studies are iterative, hypothesis driven studies beginning with general tests and continuing with analyses of increasing complexity as certain stressors are identified for further investigation. Tier 3 applies information developed in Tier 2 as predictive indicators of habitats and species at risk over broad landscape scales and provides decision support for the adaptive management of amphibian recovery.

Few studies have addressed responses of organisms exposed to combinations of chemical and physical stressors. Although antagonistic, additive and synergistic effects have been described for exposure of biota to combinations of chemical stressors, it seems to be agreed that concentration addition proves to be a reasonable worst case estimation. Therefore, aggregation of physico-chemical parameters in water quality indices and supplementary specifications of environmental quality objectives to account for mixture toxicity are generally based on concentration addition. In spite of a growing interest in multiple stressors, basic data are often lacking or inadequate to allow precise predictions of the cumulative impacts of multiple stressors at the ecosystem level. Even in the long term, investigation of all probable ecotoxicological responses to exposure to all possible combinations of stressors does not seem practically or economically feasible. Monitoring of a sophisticated combination of physico-chemical, and biological parameters improves detection and ecotoxicological risk assessment of multiple stressors.

The isolated trees were in clumps similar to trees growing in savannas and tropical forests. In our study, adults were less clumped compared to juveniles. Environmental and biotic differences related to edaphic heterogeneity, life history, and reproductive strategy could account for the clumped pattern.

We developed these topics by capitalizing on the key insights obtained using damselflies as model organisms. First, delayed contaminant effects on important fitness-related effects exist during the larval stage and after metamorphosis in the adult stage. Second, synergistic interactions of contaminants with bacteria and predation risk have been demonstrated, and we present advances in the mechanistic understanding of these synergisms with biotic interactors. Third, we illustrate the strength of assessing the effect of contaminants under global warming using a space-for-time substitution approach and the need to consider temperature extremes. These studies using damselflies as model organisms highlight the relevance of considering contaminant effects after the exposure period and in the presence of natural stressors, such as predation risk and higher temperatures. They further highlight the need for spatially explicit risk-assessment and conservation tools. These insights are relevant for most aquatic taxa. Indeed most aquatic taxa have a complex life cycle, are strongly affected by predation risk and by warming, and show latitudinal gradients.

Despite recent observational, experimental, and modeling studies suggesting increased vulnerability of trees to hotter drought and associated pests and pathogens, substantial debate remains among research, management and policy-making communities regarding future tree mortality risks. We summarize key mortality-relevant findings, differentiating between those implying lesser versus greater levels of vulnerability. Evidence suggesting lesser vulnerability includes forest benefits of elevated [CO2] and increased water-use efficiency; observed and modeled increases in forest growth and canopy greening; widespread increases in woody-plant biomass, density, and extent; compensatory physiological, morphological, and genetic mechanisms; dampening ecological feedbacks; and potential mitigation by forest management. In contrast, recent studies document more rapid mortality under hotter drought due to negative tree physiological responses and accelerated biotic attacks. Additional evidence suggesting greater vulnerability includes rising background mortality rates; projected increases in drought frequency, intensity, and duration; limitations of vegetation models such as inadequately represented mortality processes; warming feedbacks from die-off; and wildfire synergies. Grouping these findings we identify ten contrasting perspectives that shape the vulnerability debate but have not been discussed collectively. We also present a set of global vulnerability drivers that are known with high confidence: (1) droughts eventually occur everywhere; (2) warming produces hotter droughts; (3) atmospheric moisture demand increases nonlinearly with temperature during drought; (4) mortality can occur faster in hotter drought, consistent with fundamental physiology; (5) shorter droughts occur more frequently than longer droughts and can become lethal under warming, increasing the frequency of lethal drought nonlinearly; and (6) mortality happens rapidly relative to growth intervals needed for forest recovery. These high-confidence drivers, in concert with research supporting greater vulnerability perspectives, support an overall viewpoint of greater forest vulnerability globally. We surmise that mortality vulnerability is being discounted in part due to difficulties in predicting threshold responses to extreme climate events. Given the profound ecological and societal implications of underestimating global vulnerability to hotter drought, we highlight urgent challenges for research, management, and policy-making communities.",2,2015,6,8,,"Kissling, WD; Schleuning, M",Multispecies interactions across trophic levels at macroscales: retrospective and future directions,ECOGRAPHY,Review,"Trophic interactions among multiple species are ubiquitous in nature and their importance for structuring ecological communities has been extensively demonstrated at local spatial scales. However, how local species interactions scale-up to large spatial scales and how they contribute to shape species distributions and diversity patterns at macroecological extents remains less clear. Here, we provide an overview of recent and potential future developments in macroecology that explore the role of antagonistic and mutualistic interactions among multiple species across trophic levels. Recent studies broadly represent two analytical methods (analyses of species richness and ecological networks) and provide evidence that plant-animal interactions (e.g. pollination, frugivory) and predator-prey interactions influence large-scale richness patterns and that ecological network structure varies systematically at macroscales. Current methodological problems and challenges are related to defining the functional links in cross-trophic richness analyses, understanding trait effects in multispecies interactions, and addressing sampling effects when analyzing multiple ecological networks across large spatial extents. Key topics for future research are 1) testing paleoclimatic imprints on interaction diversity, 2) understanding macroevolution and the phylogenetic structure of multispecies interactions, 3) quantifying contemporary spatial and temporal variability in complex ecological networks, and 4) predicting novel interactions under global change. Moreover, we see great potential for a deeper bidirectional integration of macroecology and network research, e.g. by analyses of trait complementarity and functional diversity of interacting groups and by employing species distribution modeling to predict changes in functional network structure. Addressing these key topics and achieving a better integration between these two research fields will significantly advance our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary drivers of multispecies interactions.

Still, combined effects of drought and grazing on plant production are poorly understood, thus hampering adequate projections and development of mitigation strategies. We used a large, cross-continental database consisting of 174 long-term datasets from >30 dryland regions to quantify ecosystem responses to drought and grazing with the ultimate goal to increase functional understanding in these responses. Two key aspects of ecosystem stability, resistance to and recovery after a drought, were evaluated based on standardized and normalized aboveground net primary production (ANPP) data. Drought intensity was quantified using the standardized precipitation index. We tested effects of drought intensity, grazing regime (grazed, ungrazed), biome (grassland, shrubland, savanna) or dominant life history (annual, perennial) of the herbaceous layer to assess the relative importance of these factors for ecosystem stability, and to identify predictable relationships between drought intensity and ecosystem resistance and recovery. We found that both components of ecosystem stability were better explained by dominant herbaceous life history than by biome. Increasing drought intensity (quasi-) linearly reduced ecosystem resistance. Even though annual and perennial systems showed the same response rate to increasing drought intensity, they differed in their general magnitude of resistance, with annual systems being ca. 27% less resistant. In contrast, systems with an herbaceous layer dominated by annuals had substantially higher postdrought recovery, particularly when grazed. Combined effects of drought and grazing were not merely additive but modulated by dominant life history of the herbaceous layer. To the best of our knowledge, our study established the first predictive, cross-continental model between drought intensity and drought-related relative losses in ANPP, and suggests that systems with an herbaceous layer dominated by annuals are more prone to ecosystem degradation under future global change regimes.",2,2015,21,3,1258,1270"Nepoux, V; Babin, A; Haag, C; Kawecki, TJ; Le Rouzic, A",Quantitative genetics of learning ability and resistance to stress in Drosophila melanogaster,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Article,"Even though laboratory evolution experiments have demonstrated genetic variation for learning ability, we know little about the underlying genetic architecture and genetic relationships with other ecologically relevant traits.

Substantial additive genetic variation was detected for each trait, highlighting their potential to evolve. Genetic effects contributed more than nongenetic parental effects to variation in traits measured at the adult stage: learning, odorant perception, and resistance to infection. In contrast, the two traits quantifying larval tolerance to low-quality food were more strongly affected by parental effects.

Despite concerns about the impacts of changes in land use, eutrophication and climate warming in running waters, the interactive effects of these stressors on stream periphyton are largely unknown. We manipulated nutrients (simulating agricultural runoff), deposited fine sediment (simulating agricultural erosion) (two levels each) and water temperature (eight levels, 0-6 degrees C above ambient) simultaneously in 128 streamside mesocosms. Our aim was to determine the individual and combined effects of the three stressors on the algal and bacterial constituents of the periphyton. All three stressors had pervasive individual effects, but in combination frequently produced synergisms at the population level and antagonisms at the community level. Depending on sediment and nutrient conditions, the effect of raised temperature frequently produced contrasting response patterns, with stronger or opposing effects when one or both stressors were augmented. Thus, warming tended to interact negatively with nutrients or sediment by weakening or reversing positive temperature effects or strengthening negative ones. Five classes of algal growth morphology were all affected in complex ways by raised temperature, suggesting that these measures may prove unreliable in biomonitoring programs in a warming climate. The evenness and diversity of the most abundant bacterial taxa increased with temperature at ambient but not with enriched nutrient levels, indicating that warming coupled with nutrient limitation may lead to a more evenly distributed bacterial community as temperatures rise.

Studies of thermal stress have shown that underpinning such changes in several intertidal species are specific shifts in gene and protein expression (e.g. upregulation of heat-shock proteins). But relatively few studies have examined genetic responses to predation risk. Here, we use next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to examine the transcriptomic (mRNA) response of the snail Nucella lapillus to thermal stress and predation risk. We found that like other intertidal species, N.lapillus displays a pronounced genetic response to thermal stress by upregulating many heat-shock proteins and other molecular chaperones. In contrast, the presence of a crab predator (Carcinus maenas) triggered few significant changes in gene expression in our experiment, and this response showed no significant overlap with the snail's response to thermal stress.

Their inheritance is thus more likely through one of the two sexes, a property they share with sexually antagonistic alleles. Previous theory has shown that pairs of linked loci segregating for sexually antagonistic alleles are more likely to remain polymorphic and that linkage disequilibrium accrues between them. I probe this similarity between drive and sexual antagonism and examine the evolution of chromosomes experiencing these selection pressures simultaneously. Reminiscent of previous theory, I find that: the opportunity for polymorphism increases for a sexually antagonistic locus that is physically linked to a driving locus; the opportunity for polymorphism at a driving locus also increases when linked to a sexually antagonistic locus; and stable linkage disequilibrium accompanies any polymorphic equilibrium. Additionally, I find that drive at a linked locus favours the fixation of sexually antagonistic alleles that benefit the sex in which drive occurs. Further, I show that under certain conditions reduced recombination between these two loci is selectively favoured.

In this context, synergistic effects between predation risk and other natural stressors on prey organisms are gaining attention. Although non-pathogenic bacteria can be widespread in aquatic ecosystems, their role in mediating effects of predation risk has been ignored. We here address the hypothesis that non-pathogenic bacteria may reinforce the negative effects of predation risk in larvae of the damselfly Coenagrion puella. We found synergistic effects for all three life history variables studied: mortality increased, growth reductions were magnified and bacterial load was higher when both non-lethal stressors were combined. The combined exposure to the bacterium and predation risk considerably impaired the two key antipredator mechanisms of the damselfly larvae: they no longer reduced their food intake under predation risk and showed a synergistic reduction in escape swimming speed. The reinforcing negative effects on the fitness-related traits could be explained by the observed synergistic effects on food intake, swimming muscle mass, immune function and oxidative damage. These are likely widespread consequences of energetic constraints and increased metabolic rates associated with the fight-or-flight response. We therefore hypothesize that the here documented synergistic interactions with non-pathogenic bacteria may be widespread.

Savannas are highly heterogeneous tree-grass mixtures, and the structural variation imposed by a discontinuous canopy cover results in spatial variation in soil properties such as plant-available nutrients, temperature and soil moisture. Many savannas are also dominated by large vertebrate herbivores, which impose a different suite of effects on soil properties related to consumption, excretion and physical disturbance. 2. In nutrient-poor, water-limited systems, variation in soil resource availability may play a fundamental role in structuring plant communities, but the relative and interactive effects of key drivers of heterogeneity have received little attention in savanna ecosystems. 3. We investigated the independent and interactive effects of herbivores and tree canopy cover on multiple soil properties up to a depth of 10 cm, including bulk density, soil C pools, total and plant-available nutrients, moisture dynamics and temperature at two contrasting sites in Kruger National Park, South Africa. We analysed samples from locations under and between adult tree canopies and inside and outside long-term herbivore exclosures using a nested design. 4. We found strong positive effects of tree canopies on total and labile pools of soil C and N and negative effects on plant-available P and soil temperature. Tree canopy effects on soil moisture availability were small but clearly detectable. During precipitation events, trees increased moisture inputs on granite soils but decreased moisture inputs on basalt soils compared to open sites. 5. Conversely, we found mixed evidence for herbivore effects on soil chemistry and temperature, but a clearer effect on soil moisture, with areas outside exclosures experiencing higher soil moisture retention, particularly immediately following precipitation events. Soil bulk density, a driver of both nutrient and soil moisture dynamics, was lower under trees and when herbivores were excluded. 6. Synthesis. Our results suggest that variation in tree cover is the dominant biotic driver of C, N and P dynamics in these savanna systems in the top 10 cm of soil, that herbivores primarily affect soil moisture content, and that canopy and herbivore effects tend to be additive rather than synergistic.",2,2014,102,5,1171,1182"Gomez-Aparicio, L; Lortie, CJ",Advancing plant ecology through meta-analyses,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Editorial Material,"1. The inherent complexity of nature produces a diverse and varied set of outcomes for any given ecological process. However, the advance of ecology requires making generalizations that synthesize current knowledge and guide new basic research and practical applications. Among the synthesis tools available for this specific purpose, meta-analysis is one of the most accurate and powerful methods. 2. This Special Feature examines the use that meta-analysis has received in plant ecology over the last two decades and provides examples of synthesis applied to contemporary topics in different areas of plant ecology from populations to ecosystems. 3. The number of meta-analyses in plant ecology has been increasing rapidly in the last two decades. However, this increase has not been accompanied by a parallel increase in quality. The opening review paper in this Special Feature provides a checklist of quality criteria specific to ecological meta-analysis that will largely contribute to improvement of the methodological and reporting standards of meta-analyses. 4. The following five papers in the Special Feature demonstrate the advantages of application of meta-analysis compared with other techniques of research synthesis. Meta-analysis is applied here to demonstrate the consistency of ecological hypotheses across large spatial scales (e.g. Janzen-Connell hypothesis), understand sources of variation in the magnitude of ecological processes (e.g. herbivory effects on leaf life span, effects of intraspecific genetic diversity on communities and ecosystems), measure synergistic impacts of environmental change drivers (e.g. CO2, drought, land use) or assess research gaps within a certain sub-discipline of plant ecology (e.g. landscape fragmentation). 5. Synthesis. Meta-analysis can contribute to the advance of ecological theory by synthesizing the available evidence on specific topics and informing the scope of generalizations. However, plant ecologists can only take full advantage of this capacity if we improve our knowledge on how and when to conduct a proper meta-analysis, and by avoiding the frequent misuses that have characterized the use of this statistical tool in the ecological literature thus far.",2,2014,102,4,823,827"Hoover, DL; Knapp, AK; Smith, MD",Contrasting sensitivities of two dominant C-4 grasses to heat waves and drought,PLANT ECOLOGY,Article,"Heat waves and droughts are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity with climate change.

In a mesic tallgrass prairie ecosystem, we used a factorial experimental approach to assess ecophysiological and productivity responses of two dominant C-4 grasses, Andropogon gerardii and Sorghastrum nutans, to a season-long drought and a mid-summer heat wave at four intensities. We hypothesized that drought would have greater impacts than heat waves, that combined effects would be greater than either factor alone, and that the dominant grasses would differ in their responses to heat and water heat stress. We detected significant reductions in photosynthesis, leaf water potential, and productivity with drought but few direct responses to the heat waves. Surprisingly, there was no additive effect of heat and water stress on any plant response. However, S. nutans was more sensitive than A. gerardii to drought. In this grassland, water stress will likely dominate photosynthetic and productivity responses caused by discrete drought and heat wave events, rather than direct or additive effects of heat stress, with differential sensitivity in these grasses altering future ecosystem structure and function.",2,2014,215,7,721,731"Carnell, PE; Keough, MJ",Spatially variable synergistic effects of disturbance and additional nutrients on kelp recruitment and recovery,OECOLOGIA,Article,"Understanding the impact of multiple stressors on ecosystems is of pronounced importance, particularly when one or more of those stressors is anthropogenic. Here we investigated the role of physical disturbance and increased nutrients on reefs dominated by the canopy-forming kelp Ecklonia radiata. We combined experimental kelp canopy removals and additional nutrient at three different locations in a large embayment in temperate southeastern Australia. Over the following winter recruitment season, Ecklonia recruitment was unaffected by increased nutrients alone, but tripled at all sites where the canopy had been removed. At one site, the combination of disturbance and increased nutrients resulted in more than four times the recruitment of the introduced kelp Undaria pinnatifida. Six months after disturbance, the proliferation of the Undaria canopy in the canopy-removal and nutrient-addition treatment negatively influenced the recovery of the native kelp Ecklonia. Given the otherwise competitive dominance of adult Ecklonia, this provides a mechanism whereby Undaria could maintain open space for the following recruitment season.

However, connectivity continues to be simulated using overly simple distance-based dispersal models with little consideration of how the individual behaviour of dispersing organisms interacts with landscape structure (functional connectivity). Here, we link an individual-based model to a niche-population model to test the implications of this omission. We apply this novel approach to a turtle species inhabiting wetlands which are patchily distributed across a tropical savannah, and whose persistence is threatened by two important synergistic drivers of global change: predation by invasive species and over-exploitation. We show that projections of local range dynamics in this study system change substantially when functional connectivity is modelled explicitly. Accounting for functional connectivity in model simulations causes the estimate of extinction risk to increase, and predictions of range contraction to slow. We conclude that models of range dynamics that simulate functional connectivity can reduce an important source of bias in predictions of shifts in species distributions and abundances, especially for organisms whose dispersal behaviours are strongly affected by landscape structure.",2,2014,10,5,,"Anson, JR; Dickman, CR; Handasyde, K; Jessop, TS",Effects of multiple disturbance processes on arboreal vertebrates in eastern Australia: implications for management,ECOGRAPHY,Article,"Habitat loss and invasive predators increasingly threaten global biodiversity. Here we use a landscape-scale experimental approach to explore the individual and synergistic effects of logging and an invasive predator, the red fox Vulpes vulpes on two common native arboreal vertebrates (a predator and prey species) in south-eastern Australia. We used site occupancy methods to evaluate different models evaluating the effects of site specific forest logging disturbance, lethal fox baiting and forest structural elements for explaining variation in site occupancy of a large monitor lizard Varanus varius, and a marsupial prey, the common ringtail possum Pseudocheirus peregrinus across a complex forest landscape. Site occupancy of ringtail possum was influenced by habitat resources and the structural complexity of forest, which indirectly mediated predation risk. Presence of fox baiting had no direct effect on the ringtail site occupancy. In contrast, access to prey resources and fox baiting appeared to best explain site occupancy variation in monitor lizards across the landscape. While these species are affected primarily by separate disturbances, synergistic interactions between the processes may intensify their effects.

The pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), now widespread in Neotropical mountains, may act in synergy with climate change causing collapse in thermally stressed hosts. We measured the thermal tolerance of frogs along a wide elevational gradient in the Tropical Andes, where frog populations have collapsed. We used the difference between critical thermal maximum and the temperature a frog experiences in nature as a measure of tolerance to high temperatures. Temperature tolerance increased as elevation increased, suggesting that frogs at higher elevations may be less sensitive to rising temperatures. We tested the alternative pathogen optimal growth hypothesis that prevalence of the pathogen should decrease as temperatures fall outside the optimal range of pathogen growth. Our infection-prevalence data supported the pathogen optimal growth hypothesis because we found that prevalence of Bd increased when host temperatures matched its optimal growth range. These findings suggest that rising temperatures may not be the driver of amphibian declines in the eastern slopes of the Andes. Zoonotic outbreaks of Bd are the most parsimonious hypothesis to explain the collapse of montane amphibian faunas; but our results also reveal that lowland tropical amphibians, despite being shielded from Bd by higher temperatures, are vulnerable to climate-warming stress.

El hongo patogeno Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), actualmente ampliamente distribuido en las montanas neotropicales, puede actuar en conjunto con el cambio climatico, causando un colapso en los hospederos termalmente estresados. Medimos la tolerancia termal de las ranas a lo largo de un amplio gradiente de elevacion en la zona tropical de los Andes, donde las poblaciones de ranas han colapsado. Usamos la diferencia entre la temperatura critica maxima y la temperatura que una rana experimenta en la naturaleza como medida de tolerancia a altas temperaturas. La tolerancia a la temperatura incremento junto con la elevacion, sugiriendo que las ranas de elevaciones mas altas son menos sensibles al incremento en la temperatura.

First, realistic global change scenarios involve multiple drivers of environmental change that can interact with one another to produce non-additive effects. Second, in addition to these direct effects, global change drivers can indirectly affect plants by modifying species interactions. In order to tackle both of these challenges, we propose a novel population modeling approach, requiring only measurements of abundance and climate over time. To demonstrate the applicability of this approach, we model population dynamics of eight abundant plant species in a multifactorial global change experiment in alpine tundra where we manipulated nitrogen, precipitation, and temperature over 7years. We test whether indirect and interactive effects are important to population dynamics and whether explicitly incorporating species interactions can change predictions when models are forecast under future climate change scenarios. For three of the eight species, population dynamics were best explained by direct effect models, for one species neither direct nor indirect effects were important, and for the other four species indirect effects mattered. Overall, global change had negative effects on species population growth, although species responded to different global change drivers, and single-factor effects were slightly more common than interactive direct effects. When the fitted population dynamic models were extrapolated under changing climatic conditions to the end of the century, forecasts of community dynamics and diversity loss were largely similar using direct effect models that do not explicitly incorporate species interactions or best-fit models; however, inclusion of species interactions was important in refining the predictions for two of the species.

Facilitation is known as the positive effect of one species (benefactor) on associated neighbouring species (beneficiaries). Although the beneficial part of this interaction has received considerable research interest, there is a gap of knowledge on the bidirectional nature of these interactions; in particular, the physiological and fitness consequences for both beneficiaries and benefactors. 2. Alpine cushion plants are generally strong benefactors, increasing species richness and abundance on a global scale, and provide a suitable system to study the physiological effects of bidirectional interactions and its consequences for reproduction. Current knowledge suggests that species improve their fitness when associated to a benefactor cushion species, whereas cushions may receive predominantly negative feedbacks. 3. We measured physiological and reproductive traits of the cushion species Arenaria tetraquetra ssp. amabilis and three other forbs (Eryngium glaciale, Lotus corniculatus ssp. glacialis and Plantago nivalis) in the dry Sierra Nevada Mountains, southern Spain. All four species were studied either when growing alone or when the three forbs were associated with the cushion plant. 4. The three forb species improved their water status when associated with the cushion, and Lotus and Plantago significantly increased their seed set. In contrast, Arenaria showed poorer water status and reduced flower density and seed set with increasing cover of beneficiary species. There was a clear relationship between physiological and reproductive traits in Arenaria growing without beneficiaries but not in Arenaria with beneficiaries. Control cushions (without beneficiary species) showed increased seed set and seed mass with increasing photosynthetic and water use efficiencies, respectively, the latter being positively related to leaf nitrogen content. In contrast, cushions with a large cover of beneficiary species did not show such relations. The missing relationship between physiological and reproductive traits for these facilitating cushions indicates that reproductive output in heavily colonized cushions may not be directly related to the plant physiological status and the availability of resources. 5. Our results revealed the antagonistic behaviour underlying the interaction between beneficiary species and facilitating cushion plants, similar to parasitic interactions. They also provide indications for changes in cushions' resource allocation pattern in response to colonization by beneficiaries.",2,2014,28,2,500,508"Stella, JS; Munday, PL; Walker, SPW; Pratchett, MS; Jones, GP",From cooperation to combat: adverse effect of thermal stress in a symbiotic coral-crustacean community,OECOLOGIA,Article,"Although mutualisms are ubiquitous in nature, our understanding of the potential impacts of climate change on these important ecological interactions is deficient. Here, we report on a thermal stress-related shift from cooperation to antagonism between members of a mutualistic coral-dwelling community.

However, strong differential numerical effects occurred among crustaceans as a function of species and sex, with shrimp (75 %), and female crabs (55 %), exhibiting the fastest and greatest declines in numbers. These declines were due to forceful eviction from the coral-host by male crabs. Furthermore, surviving female crabs were impacted by a dramatic decline (85 %) in egg production, which could have deleterious consequences for population sustainability. Our results suggest that elevated temperature switches the fundamental nature of this interaction from cooperation to competition, leading to asymmetrical effects on species and/or sexes.

Yet, the advantages of including such data come at the expense of measuring traits, sequencing genes, and counting or weighing individuals, and it remains unclear whether this greater resolution yields substantial benefits in describing diversity. We summarized a decade of high-resolution trawl data from a bimonthly trawl survey to investigate spatial and seasonal patterns of demersal fish diversity in the Chesapeake Bay, USA, with the goal of identifying areas and times of mismatch between different dimensions of diversity, and their response to environmental forcing. We found moderate to strong positive relationships among all metrics of diversity, and that functional and phylogenetic differences were well-reflected in an index derived from taxonomic (Linnaean) hierarchy. Compared with species richness and species diversity, functional, phylogenetic, and taxonomic indices peaked later in the year, which was a consequence of the distribution of biomass among functionally and evolutionarily divergent species. Generalized additive models revealed that spatial, temporal, and environmental variables explained roughly similar proportions of deviance across all aspects of diversity, suggesting that these three factors do not differentially affect the functional and phylogenetic aspects of community structure. We conclude that an index of diversity derived from taxonomic hierarchy served well as a practical surrogate for functional and phylogenetic diversity of the demersal fish community in this system.

For biological invasions, much theoretical prominence has been given to additive or synergistic interactions with temperature change. However, empirical investigations are sparse. Here, we investigate the outcomes of interactions between temperature change and biological invasions on ectotherm body size in a temperate system. LocationThe sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Island group (46 degrees 54S, 37 degrees 45E). MethodsWe use long-term (24years) body size data on weevil species from Marion and Prince Edward Islands. Invasive house mice, which prey on four of the five weevil species, are present on Marion Island, while the neighbouring Prince Edward Island is mouse free. Theory predicts that with higher temperatures, body size should decline across all species, and previous work suggests that size-selective predation by mice should enhance this effect on the invaded island. Generalized linear models were used to determine the relative effects of sex, island, altitude and mean annual temperature on body size for each of the species. ResultsTemperature change and biological invasions interact to affect body size in an antagonistic fashion. In weevil species not preyed on by invasive house mice, body size and declining size with increasing temperature are consistent across adjacent invaded and non-invaded islands. By contrast, species preyed on by mice are smaller on the invaded island and show opposite size-temperature relationships on the invaded and mouse-free islands. Main conclusionsSize declines on the non-invaded island are in keeping with theoretical expectations of declining size with increasing temperatures. By contrast, this expectation is not met on the island invaded by mice, largely owing to what appears to be increased energetic demand of predators in colder years.

Separate effects of these two drivers on plant-pollinator interactions have been thoroughly studied, but we still lack an understanding of combined and potential interactive effects. In a subtropical South African landscape, we studied 17 plant-pollinator networks along two gradients of relative abundance of exotics and land-use intensity. In general, pollinator visitation rates were lower on exotic plants than on native ones. Surprisingly, while visitation rates on native plants increased with relative abundance of exotics and land-use intensity, pollinator visitation on exotic plants decreased along the same gradients. There was a decrease in the specialization of plants on pollinators and vice versa with both drivers, regardless of plant origin. Decreases in pollinator specialization thereby seemed to be mediated by a species turnover towards habitat generalists. However, contrary to expectations, we detected no interactive effects between the two drivers. Our results suggest that exotic plants and land-use promote generalist plants and pollinators, while negatively affecting specialized plant-pollinator interactions. Weak integration and high specialization of exotic plants may have prevented interactive effects between exotic plants and land-use.

Here, we identified key drivers of mangrove loss in Kenya and compared two different approaches to predicting risk. Risk factors tested included various possible predictors of anthropogenic deforestation, related to population, suitability for land use change and accessibility. Two approaches were taken to modelling risk; a quantitative statistical approach and a qualitative categorical ranking approach. A quantitative model linking rates of loss to risk factors was constructed based on generalized least squares regression and using mangrove loss data from 1992 to 2000. Population density, soil type and proximity to roads were the most important predictors. In order to validate this model it was used to generate a map of losses of Kenyan mangroves predicted to have occurred between 2000 and 2010. The qualitative categorical model was constructed using data from the same selection of variables, with the coincidence of different risk factors in particular mangrove areas used in an additive manner to create a relative risk index which was then mapped. Quantitative predictions of loss were significantly correlated with the actual loss of mangroves between 2000 and 2010 and the categorical risk index values were also highly correlated with the quantitative predictions.

We analyzed local climate change projections, the dynamics of the vegetation patches, the distribution of Catopsis in the patches, together with population genetics and demographic information. A drying and warming climate trend projected by most climate change models may contribute to explain the poor forest regeneration. Catopsis shows a positive mean stochastic population growth. A PVA reveals that quasi-extinction probabilities are not significantly affected by the current levels of harvesting or by a high drop in the frequency of wet years (2%) but increase sharply when harvesting intensity duplicates.

Our study evidences conflicting requirements between the epiphytes and their hosts and antagonistic effects of climate change and fragmentation with harvesting on a species that can exploit open spaces in the forest.

Main conclusions Our results demonstrate that a combination of elevation, area and MDE provide a basic explanation for the diversity of vascular plants in Pantepui. In addition, the present study indicates that maxima of STE are located at the highest altitudes, where the possibility of biotic connection (via migration) and gene flux has been minimal, even during glacial phases when most migration pathways amongst the tepui mountains were open.

In this study, we investigated the extent to which closely related insect herbivores with slight differences in their feeding behaviour induce contrasting reactions in plant communities. We studied the impact of herbivory by two Gomphocerinae grasshopper species, Chorthippus scalaris and Euthystira brachyptera, on the outcome of competition between the plant species Dactylis glomerata and Festuca paniculata. Under a controlled choice experiment, C. scalaris preferentially consumed D. glomerata while E. brachyptera preferred F. paniculata, but in an experimental plant community (mesocosm) both species consumed the plant species proportionally to their abundance and the amount of herbivory marks detected on the leaves did not depend on the specific grasshopper species. The herbivory pressure of both grasshopper species significantly reduced the vegetative height and the number of tillers of F. paniculata, with C. scalaris showing a stronger effect. As a consequence, herbivory by E. brachyptera did not significantly affect interspecific plant competition, whereas C. scalaris enhanced the dominance of D. glomerata. Our study shows that closely related herbivores that only slightly differ in their feeding behaviour can induce contrasting effects on interspecific plant competition, and that the dominant species D. glomerata is more tolerant to herbivory than F. paniculata.

When conditions across life stages are unpredictable, plasticity in niche shift timing may be adaptive; however, factors associated with clutch identity (e.g., genetic or maternal) may influence the effects of such plasticity. The red-eyed treefrog (Agalychnis callidryas) is an ideal organism for investigating the effects of genetics and life stage switch point timing because embryos exhibit adaptive phenotypic plasticity in hatching time. In this study, we evaluated the effects of experimentally manipulated hatching time and clutch identity on antipredator behavior of tadpoles and on developmental traits of metamorphs, including larval period, mass, SVL, and jumping ability. We found that in the presence of dragonfly nymph predator cues at 21 days post-oviposition, tadpoles reduced both their activity level and height in the water column. Furthermore, early-hatched tadpoles were less active than late-hatched tadpoles of the same age. This difference in behavior patterns of early- and late-hatched tadpoles may represent an adaptive response due to a longer period of susceptibility to odonate predators for early-hatched tadpoles, or it may be a carry-over effect mediated by early exposure to an environmental stressor (i.e., induction of early hatching). We also found that hatching time affected both behavioral traits and developmental traits, but its effect on developmental traits varied significantly among clutches. This study shows that a single early-life event may influence a suite of factors during subsequent life stages and that some of these effects appear to be dependent on clutch identity.

Integral projection models (IPMs) are used for this purpose, but it is unclear whether the conclusions drawn from their analysis are sensitive to how functional structures (the functions that describe how survival, growth and fecundity vary with individual size) are selected. We constructed 12 IPMs that differed in their functional structure by combining two reproduction models and three functional expressions (generalized linear, cubic and additive models), each with and without simplification. Models were parameterized with data from two populations of two endangered cacti subject to different disturbance intensities. For each model, we identified the demographic processes that most affected lambda in the presence of disturbance. Simulations were performed on artificial data and analyzed as above to assess the generality of the results. In both empirical and simulated data, the same processes were identified as making the largest contribution to changes in lambda regardless of the functional structure. The major differences in the results were due to misspecification of the fecundity functions, whilst functional expression and model simplification had lesser effects. Therefore, as long as the demographic attributes of the species are well known and incorporated into the model, IPMs will robustly identify the processes that most affect the growth of populations subject to disturbance, making them a reliable tool for developing conservation strategies.",2,2013,171,2,347,356"Higuchi, T; Agostini, S; Casareto, BE; Yoshinaga, K; Suzuki, T; Nakano, Y; Fujimura, H; Suzuki, Y",Bacterial enhancement of bleaching and physiological impacts on the coral Montipora digitata,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,Article,"Bleaching affects corals worldwide. We studied the effects of high seawater temperature and bacterial challenges on bleaching, metabolism, and antioxidant defenses of coral. The coral Montipora digitate and five bacterial strains (Vibrio coralliilyticus, Vibrio harveyi, Paracoccus carotinifaciens, Pseudoalteromonas sp., and Sulfitobacter sp.) were used in an inoculation experiment. The bacteria were isolated from the bleached corals and their surrounding seawater. At normal temperatures, the bacteria did not cause coral bleaching and did not affect metabolism or antioxidant enzyme activities. However, bacterial challenges in addition to high-temperature stress resulted in coral bleaching, with a 70% decrease in zooxanthellae density compared with the control, a 25% decrease in photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm), a 66% decrease in photosynthesis, and a 101% reduction in calcification activity. Tissue necrosis was observed in the most compromised branches. Respiration and activity levels of antioxidant enzymes were not affected. Corals under thermal stress alone showed signs of bleaching, but the changes in zooxanthellae density and metabolic rates were less severe than those under synergistic thermal stress and bacterial challenge. Among the bacteria examined, Sulfitobacter sp. had a greater capacity to enhance and accelerate the bleaching process under thermal stress. The mechanisms by which bacteria affect corals are not yet understood. Direct actions include infection and production of toxic substances by bacteria; indirect effects due to changes in the bacterial community under the influence of added bacteria must also be considered. Our results suggest that bacterial challenges combined with thermal stress can synergistically lead to negative outcomes in corals. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Depending on the balance between antagonistic and mutualistic interactions, they can limit or promote the success of plant species. This is particularly important in the context of exotic plant invasions where soil biota can either increase the biotic resistance of habitats, or they can shift the balance between exotic and native plants towards the exotics and thereby greatly contribute to their dominance. Here, we explored the role of soil biota in the invasion success of exotic knotweed (FallopiaXbohemica), one of the world's most noxious invasive plants. We created artificial native plant communities that were experimentally invaded by knotweed, using a range of substrates where we manipulated different fractions of soil biota. We found that invasive knotweed benefited more from the overall presence of soil biota than any of the six native species. In particular the presence of the full natural soil biota strongly shifted the competitive balance in favor of knotweed. Soil biota promoted both regeneration and growth of the invader, which suggests that soil organisms may be important both in the early establishment of knotweed and possibly its later dominance of native communities. Addition of activated carbon to the soil made the advantage of knotweed disappear, which suggests that the mechanisms underlying the positive soil biota effects are chemically mediated. Our study demonstrates that soil organisms play a key role in the invasion success of exotic knotweed.",2,2013,4,2,,"Millington, JDA; Walters, MB; Matonis, MS; Liu, JG","Modelling for forest management synergies and trade-offs: Northern hardwood tree regeneration, timber and deer",ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,Article,"In many managed forests, tree regeneration density and composition following timber harvest are highly variable. This variability is due to multiple environmental drivers - including browsing by herbivores such as deer, seed availability and physical characteristics of forest gaps and stands - many of which can be influenced by forest management. Identifying management actions that produce regeneration abundance and composition appropriate for the long-term sustainability of multiple forest values (e.g., timber, wildlife) is a difficult task. However, this task can be aided by simulation tools that improve understanding and enable evaluation of synergies and trade-offs between management actions for different resources. We present a forest tree regeneration, growth, and harvest simulation model developed with the express purpose of assisting managers to evaluate the impacts of timber and deer management on tree regeneration and forest dynamics in northern hardwood forests over long time periods under different scenarios. The model couples regeneration and deer density sub-models developed from empirical data with the Ontario variant of the US Forest Service individual-based forest growth model, Forest Vegetation Simulator. Our error analyses show that model output is robust given uncertainty in the sub-models. We investigate scenarios for timber and deer management actions in northern hardwood stands for 200 years. Results indicate that higher levels of mature ironwood (Ostrya virginiana) removal and lower deer densities significantly increase sugar maple (Acer saccharum) regeneration success rates. Furthermore, our results show that although deer densities have an immediate and consistent negative impact on forest regeneration and timber through time, the non-removal of mature ironwood trees has cumulative negative impacts due to feedbacks on competition between ironwood and sugar maple. These results demonstrate the utility of the simulation model to managers for examining long-term impacts, synergies and trade-offs of multiple forest management actions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We used an additive diversity partitioning framework and quantified species richness patterns of grassland plant communities affected by marmot disturbance across different spatial scales: within and among on- and off-marmot-mound subsites, among sites, and among landscape units (corresponding to alpha and three levels of beta richness). Values of beta richness among subsites and beta richness among landscape units were similar to those expected by chance. This suggests that plant species are randomly distributed among subsites and among landscape units, despite the prediction based on previous studies that local-scale disturbance by Siberian marmots and its interactive effects with landscape contexts disproportionately influence spatial patterns of plant species. Of the spatial components of regional richness, only the beta richness among sites was significantly different from the expected value, probably reflecting the differential spatial pattern of disturbance by marmots at a site scale. The beta richness among landscape units contributed the most to regional richness, whereas beta richness among subsites and among sites contributed less. Thus, our results suggest that local-scale disturbance by Siberian marmots has little influence on regional plant richness in a Mongolian grassland.",2,2013,214,1,29,34"Eads, AR; Mitchell, NJ; Evans, JP","PATTERNS OF GENETIC VARIATION IN DESICCATION TOLERANCE IN EMBRYOS OF THE TERRESTRIAL-BREEDING FROG, PSEUDOPHRYNE GUENTHERI",EVOLUTION,Article,"Environmental change often requires evolutionary responses, and therefore understanding the genetic architecture of susceptible populations is essential for predicting their capacity to respond adaptively.

Here, we assess the level of heritable variation in the ability of embryos to tolerate desiccation stress in Pseudophryne guentheri, a terrestrial-breeding frog that is currently experiencing a drying climate. We applied a North Carolina II breeding design to identify sources of genetic and environmental variance, and genotype-by-environment interactions (GEIs), underlying the expression of embryo survival, hatching times, hatchling mass, size, and shape. Our analysis revealed highly significant effects of water potential and maternal effects on all measured traits, while additive genetic effects were significant for hatchling shape, and nonadditive effects were observed for embryo survival. Interestingly, GEIs, including for some traits complex three-way sire-by-dam-by-environment interactions, were significant, indicating that progeny from certain malefemale crosses were more tolerant to water stress than others.

Human activities responsible for forest fragmentation tend also to change the internal characteristics of remnant patches, for example, through the creation of gaps by selective logging. While edges and gaps can be expected to cause comparable changes in the micro-environmental conditions of the forest, their effects on forest-dwelling species and their interactions are not necessarily comparable. This study compares the effect of forest edges and anthropogenic gaps on the reproductive success of a self-incompatible epiphytic plant (Mitraria coccinea), mediated by changes in its relationship with mutualists (pollinators) and antagonists (flower larcenists). Mitraria coccinea's flowers are pollinated by hummingbirds and robbed by the bumblebee Bombus dahlbomii. Edges and gaps had comparable positive effects on flower production and fruit set; however, nectar robbing was up to sevenfold higher in patches with numerous gaps and resulted in lower reproductive success (fruit set and total fruit crop).

Techno-fixes to solve the big conservation issues in southern Asia,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,Article,"The conservation challenges facing mega-biodiverse South and Southeast Asia in the 21st century are enormous. For millennia, much of the habitat of these regions was only lightly modified by human endeavour, yet now it is experiencing rampant deforestation, logging, biofuel cropping, invasive species expansion, and the synergies of climate change, drought, fire and sea-level rise. Although small-scale conservation management might assist some species and habitats, the broader sweep of problems requires big thinking and some radical solutions. Given the long expected lead times between progressive economic development and stabilization of human population size and consumption rates, we argue that 'technological fixes' cannot be ignored if we are to address social and fiscal drivers of environmental degradation and associated species extinctions in rapidly developing regions like southern Asia. The pursuit of cheap and abundant 'clean' energy from an economically rational mix of nuclear power, geothermal, solar, wind, and hydrogen-derivative 'synfuels', is fundamental to this goal. This will permit pathways of high-tech economic development that include intensified (high energy-input) agriculture over small land areas, full recycling of material goods, a transition from fossil-fuel use for transport and electricity generation, a rejection of tropical biofuels that require vast areas of arable land for production, and a viable alternative to the damming of major waterways like the Mekong, Murum and northern tributaries of the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers for hydroelectricity. Rational approaches that work at large scales must be used to deal with the ultimate, rather than just proximate, drivers of biodiversity loss in the rapidly developing regions of southern Asia.

Here we studied prescribed burning and fertilizer treatments on the productivity and diversity of a semi-arid Mediterranean grassland ecosystem. Variables measured were aboveground plant productivity, vegetation, litter and soil cover, species richness and plant density of an Avena/Hordeum (A-H) dominated plant community using a split-plot experimental design over a three-year period. Burning increased vegetative cover by 21.2% and reduced litter cover by 22.6%, while fertilization increased vegetative cover by 31.6%. The combined effect of burning and fertilization increased vegetative cover by 35.5% and reduced litter cover by 13.9%. Aboveground biomass was also higher in burned treatments (52.41 g 0.25 m(-2)) by 39.5% over unburned treatments. Burning reduced the proportion of the dominant Avena/Hordeum complex by 43.1%, thus significantly enhancing overall species richness by 52.5% over the unburned plots. On the other hand, fertilizer application increased biomass production and species richness by 37.4% and 13.5%, respectively, over the unfertilized plots. The combined effect of burning and fertilization enhanced biomass production and species richness by 90.8% and 69.8%, respectively, and reduced the dominant A-H by 45.5%. Burning generally resulted in lowering the dominance of the A-H complex compared to the control while fertilizer application had variable effect, reducing the proportion of A-H with burning but increasing it without burning. Reduction in the A-H complex increased the presence of other species, therefore enhancing diversity. Our findings showed that burning and fertilization treatments have a synergistic effect on both productivity and diversity of an arid grassland. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

But the sheer inescapability of Earth's gravitational pull has meant that its influence on Earth's organisms is difficult to study. Neutralization of the gravity vector (so-called simulated microgravity) by random movement in three-dimensional space is the best option for Earth-based experiments, with spaceflight alone offering the possibility to assess the effects of an extremely reduced gravitational field (microgravity). However, the technical constraints associated with spaceflight introduce complications that can compromise the interpretation of microgravity experiments. It can be unclear whether changes detected in these experiments reflect additional spaceflight-related stresses (temperature shifts, vibrational effects, radiation exposure, and so on) as opposed to the loss of gravitational force per se. In this issue, Herranz et al. (2010) report a careful study in which the effects of simulated and actual microgravity on gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster were compared and the effects of the flight-associated stresses on the microgravity responses were investigated. A striking finding emerged. The additional stresses associated with the spaceflight experiment altered the response to microgravity. Despite controlling for the effects of these stresses/constraints, the group found that responses to microgravity are much stronger in the stressed/constrained background than in its absence.

Lethal and sublethal toxic effects modify biological interactions through density- and trait-mediated changes. Density-mediated effects due to pesticide treatment can lead to indirect positive effects on the target species. For example, recolonization of pests can be amplified due to disturbances of antagonistic species. Trait-mediated effects can result in lethal effects of originally sublethal exposure when the pesticide is combined with additional stress. Such lethal effects can result from changes of behavior or sensitivity. Also the immune capacity and resistance of individuals to parasitic infection could be decreased. Furthermore, pesticide treatment can act independently of toxic effects. For example, habitat and oviposition site selection can be influenced. These examples highlight the diversity of processes to be considered when determining the overall consequences of pesticide treatment. We show that a better understanding of these processes is needed to predict effects of pesticides on population dynamics.

However, spatial resource heterogeneity is a powerful mechanism for multispecies coexistence when it acts synergistically with a competition-colonization trade-off.

Exposure experiments have been conducted to assess cause-effects relationships with acidic deposition and forest decline. Simulated acid rain or ozone in combination with sulfur dioxide was exposed to sixteen potted-tree species for 3 growing seasons. Rain acidity below pH 4.0 could induce deleterious effects on some broad-leaved trees, however, coniferous trees did not show any significant growth reduction. Sulfur dioxide and/or ozone induced complicated differential growth responses than the wet deposition did. Some indicated additive harmful effects of sulfur dioxide. Others showed synergistic adverse effects of ozone and sulfur dioxide. Experimental results suggest that ambient level of ozone may take an important role to reduce tree vitality, since ozone induced chronic changes in carbon allocation will be accelerated by increased nitrogen input. Assuming that fossil fuel energy consumption will continue at the current rate in the China, sulfur emission will be double at the year of 2010. Without any countermeasures for reduction of sulfur dioxide emission, it may induce possible adverse direct effects on the natural vegetation due to increasing concentration of sulfur dioxide rather than due to increasing wet deposition of sulfate.

While the number of studies that estimate the standing levels of adaptive genetic variation in populations under predicted global change scenarios is growing all the time, few studies have considered multiple environments simultaneously and even fewer have considered evolutionary potential in multivariate context. Because conditions will not be constant, adaptation to climate change is fundamentally a multivariate process so viewing genetic variances and covariances over multivariate space will always be more informative than relying on bivariate genetic correlations between traits. A multivariate approach to understanding the evolutionary capacity to cope with global change is necessary to avoid misestimating adaptive genetic variation in the dimensions in which selection will act. We assessed the evolutionary capacity of the larval stage of the marine polychaete Galeolaria caespitosa to adapt to warmer water temperatures. Galeolaria is an important habitat-forming species in Australia, and its earlier life-history stages tend to be more susceptible to stress. We used a powerful quantitative genetics design that assessed the impacts of three temperatures on subsequent survival across over 30 000 embryos across 204 unique families. We found adaptive genetic variation in the two cooler temperatures in our study, but none in the warmest temperature. Based on these results, we would have concluded that this species has very little capacity to evolve to the warmest temperature.

Intraspecific genetic diversity of long-lived plants like trees might shape patterns of herbivory by different guilds of herbivores that trees experience through time. However, previous studies on plant genetic diversity effects on herbivores have been largely short-term. We investigated how tree genotypic variation and diversity influence herbivory of silver birch Betula pendula in a long-term field experiment. Using clones of eight genotypes, we constructed experimental plots consisting of one, two, four or eight genotypes, and measured damage by five guilds of arthropod herbivores twice a year over three different years (four, six and nine years after the experiment was established). Genotypes varied significantly for most types of herbivore damage, but genotype resistance rankings often shifted over time, and none of the clones was more resistant than all others to all types of herbivores. At the plot level, birch genotypic diversity had significant positive additive effect on leaf rollers and negative non-additive effects on chewing herbivores and gall makers. In contrast, leaf-mining and leaf-tying damage was not influenced by birch genotypic diversity. Within diverse plots, the direction of genotypic diversity effects varied depending on birch genotype, some having lower and some having higher herbivory in mixed stands. This research highlights the importance of long-term studies including different feeding guilds of herbivores to understand the effects of plant genetic diversity on arthropod communities.

LocationSouth-west Western Australia. MethodsA comprehensive survey of winter annual plant communities (more than a thousand communities sampled in total) was undertaken across a natural moisture availability gradient in phosphorus (P)-limited York gum woodlands exposed to different levels of anthropogenic P enrichment. Three key functional traits (height, seed mass and specific leaf area) were measured incorporating intraspecific variation. Community richness, dominance of exotic species and trait distributions were investigated along local nutrient and regional climate gradients using hierarchical linear models. Results were assessed against expectations of moisture-regulated release from nutrient limitation based on trade-off theories and experimental findings of synergistic water and nutrient effects. ResultsConsistent with theoretical expectations, we identified significant interactions between local P levels and regional moisture availability for many of the response variables examined. Specifically, in communities exposed to both high P and high moisture we found: (1) reduced species richness, (2) high dominance of exotic species, (3) increases in community mean trait values and (4) strongly narrowing trait ranges. These results are consistent with competitive exclusion (via light competition). In naturally low-P situations we also identified shifting trait distributions and narrowing ranges as moisture stress increased, a finding consistent with environmental filtering. Main conclusionIn this P- and water-limited system, plant community responses to P enrichment are contingent on regional moisture availability in a non-additive fashion. The most dramatic changes are seen under high-P and high-moisture conditions, i.e. where productivity is high and light has become a major limiting resource.

We exposed 2 calcifying coral reef species (the scleractinian coral Acropora millepora and the green alga Halimeda opuntia) to combinations of ambient and increased pCO(2) (427 and 1073 mu atm, respectively), and 2 light intensities (35 and 150 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) for 16 d. We evaluated the individual and combined effects of these 2 stressors on weight increase, calcification rates, O-2 fluxes and chlorophyll a content for the species investigated. Weight increase of A. millepora was significantly reduced by OA (48%) and low light intensity (96%) compared to controls. While OA did not affect coral calcification in the light, it decreased calcification in the dark by 155%, leading to dissolution of the skeleton. H. opuntia weight increase was not affected by OA, but decreased (40%) at low light. OA did not affect algae calcification in the light, but decreased calcification in the dark by 164%, leading to dissolution. Low light significantly reduced gross photosynthesis (56 and 57%), net photosynthesis (62 and 60%) and respiration (43 and 48%) of A. millepora and H. opuntia, respectively. In contrast to A. millepora, H. opuntia significantly increased chlorophyll content by 15% over the course of the experiment. No interactive effects of OA and low light intensity were found on any response variable for either organism. However, A. millepora exhibited additive effects of OA and low light, while H. opuntia was only affected by low light.

New approaches for understanding dynamic communities,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,Review,"Succession has been a focus of extensive ecological study for well over a century. Despite this sustained interest, succession remains a central theme in ecological research and is positioned to continue that prominence in this era of expanding human impacts. Community ecology is currently experiencing a profound conceptual expansion, providing many new insights into succession. Here we present an existing conceptual framework of successional drivers that includes variation in site conditions, species availability and species performance, and expand it to include both evolutionary and geographic sources of variation. This framework is useful because it specifies relationships among individual drivers and is causally complete. While we generally think about succession as a within-site process, the inclusion of phylogenetic and geographic processes allows integration across broader scales. We use the conceptual framework to highlight several opportunities for successional research that have developed within community ecology, but have not been fully integrated into succession work. These ideas represent not only individual drivers of succession, but also potential synergistic processes operating through interaction with other drivers. The complexity of drivers in succession strongly argues for the need to move away from single factor studies towards combinatorial studies that incorporate multiple drivers. Utilizing a trait-based approach should allow researchers to address successional drivers at multiple ecological scales and lead to new insights that integrate ecological systems. Our ability to do this will depend on the availability of equivalent data across multiple systems, suggesting the need for more standardization in successional studies. Addressing the research opportunities highlighted here will not only produce insights into successional systems, but also expand our understanding of fundamental questions in community ecology as a whole. Of particular importance is the ability to address broader scale questions that go beyond the idiosyncrasies of individual sites and systems. Understanding the dynamics of successional systems will remain critical to understanding, managing and predicting anthropogenic impacts on natural systems.",1,2015,29,2,154,164"Motzke, I; Tscharntke, T; Wanger, TC; Klein, AM",Pollination mitigates cucumber yield gaps more than pesticide and fertilizer use in tropical smallholder gardens,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,Article,"Pollination can be an essential but often neglected ecosystem service to mitigate crop yield gaps. Pollination services are usually studied in isolation, and their relative role and possible interactions with other factors, such as major management practices, is little understood. We tested how pollination (insect vs. wind- and self-pollination) interacts with weed control, fertilization and insect herbivore control and how these factors as well as flower-visiting bees influence fruit set and yield of cucumber Cucumis sativus L. in 13 traditional Indonesian home gardens. Although insect pollination, fertilization and weed control additively increased crop yield, fertilization and weed control alone could not compensate for pollination loss. Pollination individually accounted for 75% of the yield and was, hence, the most important driver of yield. In contrast, herbivore control through insecticides at commonly applied levels did not increase yield. Yield strongly increased with higher number of flower-visiting bee individuals, while the number of bee individuals in turn was not influenced by weed control, fertilization or herbivore control, but increased with higher number of cucumber flowers.Synthesis and applications. Although multiple management practices influence yield, they cannot compensate yield gaps from pollinator loss in cucumber smallholder production in Indonesia. Our results also show that the widespread use of insecticides without considering the impacts on pest reduction is uneconomical. Here, reducing insecticides caused no income loss and, at the same time, reduces potential risks to important pollinators, which needs to be acknowledged by policy-driven regulations for pesticide application in tropical agroecosystems.

This may reflect variation in limitation by different abiotic niche dimensions (realized niche shift) or phenotypic effects of biotic interactions that vary among ranges (realized niche expansion). Novel abiotic and biotic environments in the introduced range may also lead to genetic changes in exotic plant traits that enhance their abiotic stress tolerance (fundamental niche expansion). Here, we investigated how biotic interactions (aboveground herbivory and soil organisms) affect plant salinity tolerance using the invasive species Triadica sebifera from China (native range) and US (introduced range) populations grown in common gardens in both ranges. Simulated herbivory significantly reduced survival in saline treatments with reductions especially large at low salinity. Soil sterilization had a negative effect on survival at low salinity in China but had a positive effect on survival at low salinity in the US. Triadica survival and biomass were higher for US populations than for China populations, particularly in China but salinity tolerance did not depend on population origin. On average, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization was higher for US populations, US soils and low salinity. These factors had a significant, positive, non-additive interaction so that clipped seedlings from US populations in low saline US soils had high levels of AM colonization. Overall, our results show that phenotypic biotic interactions shape Triadica's salinity tolerance.

Previous studies show that these environmental co-stressors significantly impact upon a number of key physiological functions, including calcification, metabolism and growth, in many marine organisms. Yet despite the importance of the immune system, to date only a handful of studies have investigated the impact of reduced seawater pH on an organism's immune response. Furthermore, whilst temperature has received far greater attention with respect to host defence, there is a dearth of information concerning the possible synergism of these two stressors on immune defence. Here we show that a 90 day exposure to reduced seawater pH led to a reduction in the antibacterial activity of cell-free haemolymph in the blue mussel Mytilus edulis, whilst temperature led to an increase in this immune parameter. However in contrast to previous research, following this initial 90 day exposure, mussels in the current study were then exposed to the pathogenic bacterium, Vibrio tubiashii. Crucially, whilst reduced seawater pH initially appeared to impair immunological functioning, as has been interpreted previously, mussels demonstrated the ability to restore haemolymph bactericidal activity when required. This indicated that the initial reduction in antibacterial activity was in fact a reversible physiological trade-off, rather than an irreversible impairment of immune function. By demonstrating this plasticity, the current study illustrates the need to measure organism responses within a realistic natural context (i.e. measuring the immune response of an organism in the presence of a pathogen). Failure to do so may result in a misleading interpretation of the ecological relevance of experimental data, and thus the sensitivity of different species in a rapidly changing environment.

In six seashore mallow plantations, its well-developed perennial root system promoted the growth of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus in the rhizosphere, where the fungus's activity produced total glomalin (TG, ranging from 0.85 to 2.43 mg g(-1) soil), with a high ratio of TG/SOC (soil organic carbon) up to 53.29% in six-year-old seashore mallow plantation. K. virginica ameliorated the condition of saline soils, promoted native species growth, and increased plant diversity in the plantation sites. Seashore mallow contains many bioactive compounds, e.g., polysaccharides, saponins, flavonoids, etc. which have high bioactivity, and could be used as a fodder additive or for the development of health foods. The leaf, flower, stem and root of K. virginica, serve as raw materials for hierachical development of useful products according to their different properties. This study reviews and summarizes research on K. virginica in China during the past 20 years since its introduction from the USA.

However, to what extent resistance interacts with disturbance to control invasion success remains unclear. We studied the interaction between biotic resistance, fire and small-scale disturbances mimicking those of large mammalian herbivores (hoof action and grazing) on invasion success of the alien shrub Chromolaena odorata. LocationHluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, South Africa. MethodsWe performed a seedling transplant experiment in a savanna grassland. We manipulated the grass layer by clipping (grazing), created small-scale soil disturbances (hoof action) and transplanted seedlings under native tree canopies to assess potential nursing effects. Subsequently, we burned half of our plots. We assessed the effect of fire and small-scale disturbances on seedling growth, survival and biomass allocation. ResultsSeedling survival of C.odorata was 26% in undisturbed savanna grassland, reducing to 5% post-fire. Small-scale disturbances increased seedling biomass and survival and modified biomass allocation, whereas fire greatly reduced seedling survival. Root allocation increased in response to grass clipping, while stem allocation decreased. Tree shading increased seedling survival in the absence of fire, but greatly reduced post-fire survival. ConclusionsGrass communities in savannas exert a high level of biotic resistance to C.odorata invasion. However, small-scale disturbances, mimicking those of large mammalian herbivores, can facilitate the invasion of C.odorata in savanna grassland both directly, by creating micro-sites for establishment, and indirectly, by reducing the negative effect of fire.

We examined the influence of a natural (non-anthropogenic acidity) vs. human-induced stress (land drainage) and their interaction on species richness and spatial turnover ( diversity) of stream diatom, bryophyte, and benthic invertebrate communities. Our four stream categories were: circumneutral reference, circumneutral impacted, naturally acidic, and naturally acidic impacted streams. We expected the most sensitive species to be present only in the circumneutral reference streams. Therefore, species richness should be highest in these streams and lowest in the naturally acidic streams additionally stressed by forest drainage. Alternatively, communities in acidic streams may consist of the most tolerant taxa that are unaffected by further stressors, species richness in these streams remaining unaffected by drainage. We also expected spatial turnover to be highest in the circumneutral near-pristine streams and lowest in the drainage-impacted acidic streams. In all three taxonomic groups, diversity was lower in the naturally acidic than in circumneutral streams. The additional impact of the anthropogenic stress on species richness varied between groups, having no effect on diatoms, antagonistic effect on bryophytes, and additive effect on invertebrates. We also found differences in how each stressor modified diversity of each taxonomic group. For diatoms, diversity showed an overall tendency to decrease with increasing stress level, while bryophyte diversity responded mainly to forest drainage. Benthic invertebrate diversity did not differ between treatments. Our results suggest that non-additive effects among stressors need special attention to improve the understanding and management of multifactor responses in streams.

The idea that nurse-based restoration can accelerate the recovery of these forests is underexplored, despite its promise as a restoration technique. Recent conceptual models predict that facilitation among plants may be an important mechanism, but there is a lack of strong empirical support. We gathered experimental data to test this prediction and explore the relevance of using nurse-based forest restoration in these environments. A 20-month factorial experimental design in the Andean tropical cloud forest was established. We measured the survival and estimated the biomass production of transplanted seedlings of a keystone canopy forest species, Ceroxylon echinulatum (Arecaceae), in a deforested area in the presence/absence of herbivory, a potential nurse plant (the tussock grass Setaria sphacelata, Poaceae) and artificial shade. The joint effects of deforestation and herbivory led to the death of all seedlings, whereas most seedlings survived in the adjacent forest, which was used as the control. The presence of nurse plants led to significantly higher survival and growth of Ceroxylon seedlings throughout the experiment, regardless of herbivore presence. The nurse effects were explained by a reduction of the relative abiotic stress experienced by the seedlings outside the forest, that is, the consistently decreasing maximum vapour pressure deficit. Furthermore, nurse tussocks delayed and reduced the effects of herbivory by offering physical protection and a refuge for seedlings against detection by herbivores. However, the effects of herbivory and abiotic stress on facilitation were not additive.Synthesis and applications. Facilitation in degraded cloud forest can be intense as soon as the beneficiary plants are driven away from their physiological optimum (relative abiotic stress) and/or are confronted by herbivory.

Here, we compared forest bird species richness and composition in the municipalities of Santarem and Belterra in Para state, eastern Brazilian Amazon, with a road network metric called 'roadless volume (RV)' at the scale of small hydrological catchments (averaging 3721 ha). We found a significant positive relationship between RV and both forest bird richness and the average number of unique species (species represented by a single record) recorded at each site. Forest bird community composition was also significantly affected by RV. Moreover, there was no significant correlation between RV and forest cover, suggesting that road networks may impact biodiversity independently of changes in forest cover. However, variance partitioning analysis indicated that RV has partially independent and therefore additive effects, suggesting that RV and forest cover are best used in a complementary manner to investigate changes in biodiversity.

As the oceans warm and decrease in pH due to increased anthropogenic CO2 production(,) coral reefs are also susceptible to bleaching, disease and reduced calcification. The impacts of ocean acidification and warming may be exacerbated by COTS predation, but it is not known how this major predator will fare in a changing ocean. Because larval success is a key driver of population outbreaks, we investigated the sensitivities of larval A. planci to increased temperature (2-4 degrees C above ambient) and acidification (0.3-0.5 pH units below ambient) in flow-through cross-factorial experiments (3 temperaturex3 pH/pCO(2) levels). There was no effect of increased temperature or acidification on fertilization or very early development. Larvae reared in the optimal temperature (28 degrees C) were the largest across all pH treatments. Development to advanced larva was negatively affected by the high temperature treatment (30 degrees C) and by both experimental pH levels (pH 7.6, 7.8). Thus, planktonic life stages of A. planci may be negatively impacted by near-future global change. Increased temperature and reduced pH had an additive negative effect on reducing larval size. The 30 degrees C treatment exceeded larval tolerance regardless of pH. As 30 degrees C sea surface temperatures may become the norm in low latitude tropical regions, poleward migration of A. planci may be expected as they follow optimal isotherms. In the absence of acclimation or adaptation, declines in low latitude populations may occur. Poleward migration will be facilitated by strong western boundary currents, with possible negative flow-on effects on high latitude coral reefs.

We studied long-term changes (1980-2012) in forest dynamics and liana (woody vine) abundance and biomass in fragmented and intact forests of the central Amazon. We did so by contrasting trends in 33 permanent 1-ha plots near forest edges (plot center <100 m from the nearest edge) with those in 36 1-ha plots in intact-forest interiors (150-3300 m from nearest edge). In fragmented and edge-affected forests, rates of tree (>= 10 cm diameter at breast height) mortality and recruitment were often sharply elevated, especially in the first 10-15 years after fragmentation. Lianas (>2 cm stem diameter) also increased markedly in abundance (mean 6 SD = 1.78 +/- 1.23% per yr) and biomass (1.30 +/- 1.39% per yr) over time, especially in plots with high edge-related tree mortality. However, plots in undisturbed forest interiors, which were originally established as experimental controls, also experienced long-term changes. In these plots, tree mortality and recruitment rose significantly over time, as did liana abundance (1.00 +/- 0.88% per yr) and biomass (0.32 +/- 1.37% per yr). These changes were smaller in magnitude than those in fragments but were nonetheless concerted in nature and highly statistically significant. The causes of these changes in forest interiors are unknown, but are broadly consistent with those expected from rising atmospheric CO2 or regional climate drivers that influence forest dynamics. Hence, the dynamics of Amazonian forest fragments cannot be understood simply as a consequence of forest fragmentation. Rather, the changes we observed appear to arise from an interaction of fragmentation with one or more global-or regional-scale drivers affecting forest dynamics.

Coral bleaching, the potential decreases in dissolved oxygen concentration (deoxygenation) and pH (acidification) in the oceans can induce severe changes in coral reef ecosystem biodiversity and functionality. The main objective of this study was to apply four Ecopath with Ecosim models of a Caribbean coral reef system to individually and collectively model the effects of coral bleaching on the trophic web, deoxygenation on fish, and acidification on calcifying organisms. These three sources of stress were used as forcing functions on several trophic groups depending on the model. The forcing functions were scaled according to the species' responses achieved in previously tested climate change marine models. For the bleaching model, a mediation function was also considered that represents the degree of coral reef protection on small and intermediate fish groups. The dynamic models were constructed from an extensive database of 171 reef fish species (abundance and biomass) and benthic communities from 13 coral reefs that were evenly distributed parallel to approximately 400 km of the Mexican Caribbean coast as well as fishery landings in this area. Simulations driven with these different forcing and mediation functions predicted different changes in the biomasses of fish and non-fish functional groups as well as the biomass of the functional groups of fished species. Coral bleaching and pH reduction caused a phase shift to a decrease in coral biomass and an increase in primary producer biomass. This shift produced a cascading decrease in the biomass of small and intermediate fish groups. Additionally, the fished functional group biomass increased with coral bleaching but decreased with the effects of decreased oxygen on fish and pH on calcifying organisms. The biomasses of certain macroinvertebrate functional groups were predicted to respond favourably to the combined effect of the sources of stress. However, when all the sources of stress were combined, we found a general decrease of biomass in fish, non-fish, and some commercially valuable fish and macroinvertebrate functional groups, suggesting that the combined effects of stress induced synergistic effects as a result of global climate change and overfishing, which can result in a potential loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services in coral reefs.

However, these assessments have been made using extreme levels of desiccation stress (less than 10% relative humidity (RH)) that extend well beyond the changes projected for the wet tropics under climate change scenarios over the next 30 years.

All major pools were considered, including organic and mineral soil (10 cm depth), and contrasted with neighboring undisturbed forests as a reference. The disturbances had an additive effect on carbon loss, with increasing numbers of disturbances resulting in progressively decreasing carbon/black carbon stocks. This resulted from lower substrate availability and higher fire intensity. Surprisingly, there was no significant difference between reference and burned plots in terms of total black carbon.

Here we tested experimentally how Tetrahymena thermophila protist predation and PNM phage parasitism (bacteria-specific virus) alone and together affect the evolution of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 virulence, measured in wax moth larvae. Protist predation selected for small colony types, both in the absence and presence of phage, which showed decreased edibility to protists, reduced growth in the absence of enemies and attenuated virulence. Although phage selection alone did not affect the bacterial phenotype, it weakened protist-driven antipredatory defence (biofilm formation), its associated pleiotropic growth cost and the correlated reduction in virulence. These results suggest that protist selection can be a strong coincidental driver of attenuated bacterial virulence, and that phages can constrain this effect owing to effects on population dynamics and conflicting selection pressures.

In free-living great tits (Parus major), we quantified heritability, common environmental effect, sexual dimorphism and cross-sex genetic correlation in offspring resistance to oxidative stress by performing a split-nest cross-fostering experiment where 155 broods were split, and all siblings (n=791) translocated and raised in two other nests. Resistance to oxidative stress was measured as both oxidative damage to lipids and erythrocyte resistance to a controlled free-radical attack. Both measurements of oxidative stress showed low additive genetic variances, high common environmental effects and phenotypic sexual dimorphism with males showing a higher resistance to oxidative stress. Cross-sex genetic correlations were not different from unity, and we found no substantial heritability in resistance to oxidative stress at adult age measured on 39 individuals that recruited the subsequent year.

However, few empirical studies have tested the potential for disturbance to mediate competition between engineers. We examined the capacity for disturbance and habitat modification to explain the disjunct distributions of two benthic ecosystem engineers, eelgrass Zostera marina and the burrowing ghost shrimp Neotrypaea californiensis, in two California estuaries. Sediment sampling in eelgrass and ghost shrimp patches revealed that ghost shrimp change benthic biogeochemistry over small scales (centimeters) but not patch scales (meters to tens of meters), suggesting a limited capacity for sediment modification to explain species distributions. To determine the relative competitive abilities of engineers, we conducted reciprocal transplantations of ghost shrimp and eelgrass. Local ghost shrimp densities declined rapidly following the addition of eelgrass, and transplanted eelgrass expanded laterally into the surrounding ghost shrimp-dominated areas. When transplanted into eelgrass patches, ghost shrimp failed to persist. Ghost shrimp were also displaced from plots with structural mimics of eelgrass rhizomes and roots, suggesting that autogenic habitat modification by eelgrass is an important mechanism determining ghost shrimp distributions. However, ghost shrimp were able to rapidly colonize experimental disturbances to eelgrass patch edges, which are common in shallow estuaries.

We modelled a two-generation pedigree with the animal model to distinguish additive genetic variance from maternal and common environmental effects. The results show that FMR is significantly heritable, with additive genetic variance accounting for about 40% of total phenotypic variance; thus, FMR has the potential to respond to selection on dispersal capacity. Maternal influences on flight metabolism were negligible. Heritability of flight metabolism was context dependent, as in stressful thermal conditions, environmentally induced variation dominated over additive genetic effects. There was no heritability in RMR, which was instead strongly influenced by maternal effects. This study contributes to a mechanistic understanding of the evolution of dispersal-related traits, a pressing question in view of the challenges posed to many species by changing climate and fragmentation of natural habitats.",1,2014,27,8,1733,1743"Salo, T; Pedersen, MF",Synergistic effects of altered salinity and temperature on estuarine eelgrass (Zostera marina) seedlings and clonal shoots,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,Article,"Salinity and temperature are among the most important factors determining eelgrass distribution and performance. Plants in estuarine environments experience large variations in both on a seasonal basis and exceptionally warm summers have caused massive die-backs of eelgrass in many areas. We investigated experimentally how different combinations of salinity and temperature affect the physiological performance of adult eelgrass (Zostera marina) shoots and seedlings. Plants were exposed to different combinations of salinity (salinity 5, 12.5 and 20) and temperature (15,20 and 25 degrees C) in a 5-week aquarium experiment. Plants responded in general negatively to decreasing salinity and increasing temperature and the combination of high temperature and low salinity resulted in markedly higher mortality rates and lower leaf production when compared to plants held at more optimal combinations of salinity and temperature. Seedlings had higher absolute mortality, while adult shoots were relatively more sensitive to unfavorable levels of salinity. Leaf tissue sucrose concentrations in both life stages decreased at low salinity, whereas salinity and temperature resulted in contrasting starch concentrations between seedlings and adult shoots. Our results show that altered salinity and temperature may have negative synergistic effects on eelgrass performance. Future climate changes may thus have serious impacts on eelgrass survival and performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Some Trichoderma isolates can directly affect plant pathogens, but they also are known to influence the phytohormonal network of their host plant, thus leading to an improvement of plant growth and stress tolerance. In this study, we tested whether alterations in the phytohormone signature induced by different Trichoderma isolates correspond with their ability for biocontrol and growth promotion. Four Trichoderma isolates were collected from agricultural soils and were identified as the species Trichoderma harzianum (two isolates), Trichoderma ghanense, and Trichoderma hamatum. Their antagonistic activity against the plant pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. melonis was tested in vitro, and their plant growth-promoting and biocontrol activity against Fusarium wilt on melon plants was examined in vivo, and compared to that of the commercial strain T. harzianum T-22. Several growth- and defense-related phytohormones were analyzed in the shoots of plants that were root-colonized by the different Trichoderma isolates. An increase in auxin and a decrease in cytokinins and abscisic acid content were induced by the isolates that promoted the plant growth. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to evaluate the relationship between the plant phenotypic and hormonal variables. PCA pointed to a strong association of auxin induction with plant growth stimulation by Trichoderma. Furthermore, the disease-protectant ability of the Trichoderma strains against F. oxysporum infection seems to be more related to their induced alterations in the content of the hormones abscisic acid, ethylene, and the cytokinin trans-zeatin riboside than to the in vitro antagonism activity against F. oxysporum.",1,2014,40,7,804,815"Shantz, AA; Burkepile, DE",Context-dependent effects of nutrient loading on the coral-algal mutualism,ECOLOGY,Article,"Human-mediated increases in nutrient availability alter patterns of primary production, impact species diversity, and threaten ecosystem function. Nutrients can also alter community structure by disrupting the relationships between nutrient-sharing mutualists that form the foundation of communities. Given their oligotrophic nature and the dependence of reef-building corals on symbiotic relationships, coral reefs may be particularly vulnerable to excess nutrients. However, individual studies suggest complex, even contradictory, relationships among nutrient availability, coral physiology, and coral growth. Here, we used meta-analysis to establish general patterns of the impact of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) on coral growth and photobiology. Overall, we found that over a wide range of concentrations, N reduced coral calcification 11%, on average, but enhanced metrics of coral photobiology, such as photosynthetic rate. In contrast, P enrichment increased average calcification rates by 9%, likely through direct impacts on the calcification process, but minimally impacted coral photobiology. There were few synergistic impacts of combined N and P on corals, as the nutrients impact corals via different pathways. Additionally, the response of corals to increasing nutrient availability was context dependent, varying with coral taxa and morphology, enrichment source, and nutrient identity. For example, naturally occurring enrichment from fish excretion increased coral growth, while human-mediated enrichment tended to decrease coral growth. Understanding the nuances of the relationship between nutrients and corals may allow for more targeted remediation strategies and suggest how other global change drivers such as overfishing and climate change will shape how nutrient availability impacts corals.",1,2014,95,7,1995,2005"Earles, JM; North, MP; Hurteau, MD",Wildfire and drought dynamics destabilize carbon stores of fire-suppressed forests,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,Article,"Widespread fire suppression and thinning have altered the structure and composition of many forests in the western United States, making them more susceptible to the synergy of large-scale drought and fire events. We examine how these changes affect carbon storage and stability compared to historic fire-adapted conditions. We modeled carbon dynamics under possible drought and fire conditions over a 300-year simulation period in two mixed-conifer conditions common in the western United States: (1) pine-dominated with an active fire regime and (2) fir-dominated, fire suppressed forests. Fir-dominated stands, with higher live- and dead-wood density, had much lower carbon stability as drought and fire frequency increased compared to pine-dominated forest. Carbon instability resulted from species (i.e., fir's greater susceptibility to drought and fire) and stand (i.e., high density of smaller trees) conditions that develop in the absence of active management. Our modeling suggests restoring historic species composition and active fire regimes can significantly increase carbon stability in fire-suppressed, mixed-conifer forests.

Here we describe new pore-forming colicin R, specifically produced in biofilms formed by the natural isolate Escherichia coli ROAR029 but that cannot be detected under planktonic culture conditions. We demonstrate that an increased SOS stress response within mature biofilms induces SOS-dependent colicin R expression. We provide evidence that colicin R displays increased activity against E. coli strains that have a reduced lipopolysaccharide length, such as the pathogenic enteroaggregative E. coli LF82 clinical isolate, therefore pointing to lipopolysaccharide size as an important determinant for resistance to colicins. We show that colicin R toxicity toward E. coli LF82 is increased under biofilm conditions compared with planktonic susceptibility and that release of colicin R confers a strong competitive advantage in mixed biofilms by rapidly outcompeting sensitive neighboring bacteria. This work identifies the first biofilm-associated colicin that preferentially targets biofilm bacteria.

However, mechanistic understanding of environmental controls of top predator size is poorly developed. We used streams to investigate how predator body size is altered by three fundamental climate change stressors: reductions in habitat size, increases in disturbance and warmer temperatures. Using new survey data from 74 streams, we showed that habitat size and disturbance were the most important stressors influencing predator body size. A synergistic interaction between that habitat size and disturbance due to flooding meant the sizes of predatory fishes peaked in large, benign habitats and their body size decreased as habitats became either smaller or harsher. These patterns were supported by experiments indicating that habitat-size reductions and increased flood disturbance decreased both the abundance and biomass of large predators. This research indicates that interacting climate change stressors can influence predator body size, resulting in smaller predators than would be predicted from examining an environmental factor in isolation. Thus, climate-induced changes to key interacting environmental factors are likely to have synergistic impacts on predator body size which, because of their influence on the strength of biological interactions, will have far-reaching effects on food-web responses to global environmental change.",1,2014,20,5,1550,1558"Tweiten, MA; Hotchkiss, SC; Vitousek, PM; Kellner, JR; Chadwick, OA; Asner, GP",Resilience against exotic species invasion in a tropical montane forest,JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE,Article,"Question How do canopy disturbance and soil properties structure vascular plant community species composition and resilience to encroachment by exotic species in a tropical montane wet forest? Location Hawai'i Experimental Tropical Forest (HETF), a tropical montane wet forest, on Mauna Kea, Hawai'i Island, Hawai'i, USA. Methods Previous studies employing airborne LiDAR were used to define three zones across an elevation gradient from 900 to 1500m. Within each zone, a ~1000-m block transect was selected to cross two different volcanic substrates: one derived from surface lava and one derived from thick ash deposits. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) scores of vegetation data were related to independently-derived environmental NMS scores and spatial location with generalized additive models (GAM). Results Vascular plant species composition in all elevation zones consists of three NMS axes, which are best modelled by one of three possible environmental NMS axes or by location. The first NMS axis of species composition in the lowest elevation zone (40% variance explained (VE)) is a function of location on volcanic substrates (61% deviance explained (DE)). The second lowest elevation axis (27% VE) is a function of unexplained spatial heterogeneity (31% DE). The third lowest elevation NMS axis (24% VE) is a function of the spatial mosaic of canopy disturbance (16% DE). In the middle elevation zone, species composition most strongly relates to the interaction between volcanic substrate and the condition of the soil surface for all three NMS axes (41%, 27%, 24% VE; 70%, 16%, 24% DE). The primary axis of species composition in the highest elevation zone (41% VE) corresponds with substrate and soil condition (55% DE) but the second and third axes of species composition (27% and 25% VE) relate to canopy dieback disturbance (36%, 14% DE). Counts of exotic species and 0-2m height class native tree species respond to the type of volcanic substrate and soil surface condition in all three elevation zones. Lava-derived substrates have a higher incidence of exotic species and less native tree regeneration; whereas ash-derived substrates have higher numbers of native tree species regenerating and many fewer exotic species. Discussion The tropical montane forests on Mauna Kea reflect a native-dominated plant community response to disturbance on both lava- and ash-derived volcanic substrates, and a higher propensity for exotic species to occur on the lava-derived substrate. Native plant communities on ash-derived soils may have higher resilience to exotic invasion than communities on lava-derived substrates.

We surveyed dung beetles from 17 pastures located in the northeastern part of Tochigi Prefecture, which is in the center of mainland Japan. From 1999 to 2001, surveys were conducted during the 6-month grazing period (May to October) by using dung baited basket traps. We also collected information about the environmental conditions and pasture management practices. Twenty-five dung beetle species belonging to Geotrupinae, Scarabaeinae, and Aphodiinae (including 13 tunneler and 12 dweller species) were recorded. The abundance of dweller species decreased with increasing elevation, possibly because of the effect of rainfall, whereas the species richness of tunneler species was affected by cattle disturbance and soil condition. Beetle species richness significantly increased with the number of years that the pastures had been grazed. Ivermectin administration did not appear to have any adverse effect on dung beetle abundance, species richness, or species diversity. The dung beetle datasets of the current study (including specific tunneler and dweller beetle groups) supported the widely documented positive relationship between local abundance and species distribution ranges.

Good-genes-for-viability' models predict that females prefer mates of high additive genetic value, such that offspring survival should correlate with male attractiveness. Mate choice may also vary with genetic diversity (e.g. heterozygosity) or compatibility (e.g. relatedness), where the female's genotype influences choice. The relative importance of these nonexclusive hypotheses remains unclear. Leks offer an excellent opportunity to test their predictions, because lekking males provide no material benefits and choice is relatively unconstrained by social limitations. Using 12years of data on lekking lance-tailed manakins, Chiroxiphia lanceolata, we tested whether offspring survival correlated with patterns of mate choice. Offspring recruitment weakly increased with father attractiveness (measured as reproductive success, RS), suggesting attractive males provide, if anything, only minor benefits via offspring viability. Both male RS and offspring survival until fledging increased with male heterozygosity. However, despite parent-offspring correlation in heterozygosity, offspring survival was unrelated to its own or maternal heterozygosity or to parental relatedness, suggesting survival was not enhanced by heterozygosity per se. Instead, offspring survival benefits may reflect inheritance of specific alleles or nongenetic effects. Although inbreeding depression in male RS should select for inbreeding avoidance, mates were not less related than expected under random mating. Although mate heterozygosity and relatedness were correlated, selection on mate choice for heterozygosity appeared stronger than that for relatedness and may be the primary mechanism maintaining genetic variation in this system despite directional sexual selection.",1,2014,23,4,933,946"Pedrana, J; Bernad, L; Maceira, NO; Isacch, JP","Human-Sheldgeese conflict in agricultural landscapes: Effects of environmental and anthropogenic predictors on Sheldgeese distribution in the southern Pampa, Argentina",AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,Article,"Sheldgeese species are currently the subject of serious conservation concern and have been a source of historical conflict with agricultural interests.

Initially driven by a desire to understand the potential for small-scale farmers to produce jatropha biodiesel in a sustainable way, we started to examine how farmers related to trees in different parts of the agricultural landscape. This provided us with insights into small-scale processes of land enclosure and conversion, which indicate that agricultural intensification is taking place. We learned that although the landscape could in theory accommodate a lot of jatropha hedges around existing (maize dominated) arable land, farmers were only creating hedges around new fields, carved out in the grazing commons. Already well established within the settlement, jatropha can produce a range of different ecosystem services. However, our case study suggests that scalability is problematic: cultural ecosystem services can be provided at very limited levels of production; supporting ecosystem services require a certain scaling up of production; and provisioning ecosystem services, like biofuels, would require production to be increased well beyond any synergies with ongoing tree plantings or land conversion processes.",1,2014,19,2,,"Barbehenn, RV; Kochmanski, J",Searching for synergism: effects of combinations of phenolic compounds and other toxins on oxidative stress in Lymantria dispar caterpillars,CHEMOECOLOGY,Article,"Synergistic combinations of plant allelochemicals are commonly believed to increase their effectiveness as defenses against insect herbivores. For example, temperate deciduous trees produce large amounts of phenolic compounds (primarily tannins), but many of these trees also produce smaller amounts of other potentially toxic compounds. This study tested the hypothesis that mixtures of phenolics and other types of toxins produce a greater effect on oxidative stress (a measure of toxicity) than do phenolics alone. Oxidative stress was measured in Lymantria dispar (gypsy moth) larvae as a shift in the redox balance of glutathione (GSH) towards a higher percentage of its oxidized form (glutathione disulfide; GSSG). We began by showing that larvae that ingested ellagitannins and chlorogenic acid (phenolics) contained greatly elevated levels of reactive oxygen species in their midgut contents, but this was not sufficient to shift the redox balance of GSH in their midgut tissues. Therefore, the phenolic compounds were tested in pairwise combinations with juglone (a quinone), rutin, kaempferol, or quercitrin (flavonoids), quinine, berberine, gramine, or glaucine (alkaloids), and soy or Quillaja saponins. When each of these allelochemical combinations was treated on hybrid poplar (Populus tremula x P. alba) leaves and consumed by L. dispar larvae for a 2-day period, none significantly shifted the redox balance of GSH. GSH levels were induced by the combination of phenolics with an alkaloid and a saponin, suggesting that a ""cocktail"" of allelochemicals might produce a more effective plant defense. GSH levels were also found to increase with larval age, both within and between instars. Increased levels of GSH may help explain the greater resistance of late-instar than early-instar larvae to plant defenses. Overall, the results of this study do not support the hypothesis that the combined effects of phenolic compounds and other toxins in sugar maple (Acer saccharum) leaves produce a synergistic increase in oxidative stress in L. dispar larvae. Further work is needed to test the general hypothesis that the allelochemical diversity in plants functions, in part, to produce synergistic toxicological effects in insect herbivores.",1,2013,23,4,219,231"Gomez, J; Barboza, FR; Defeo, O",Environmental drivers defining linkages among life-history traits: mechanistic insights from a semiterrestrial amphipod subjected to macroscale gradients,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Article,"Determining the existence of interconnected responses among life-history traits and identifying underlying environmental drivers are recognized as key goals for understanding the basis of phenotypic variability.

The latter often rely on methods, which repeatedly fragment the underground system, thereby trigger adventitious and axillary buds to sprout, and consequently reduce the amount of stored energy. If carried out at times when no re-growth occurs, treatments will have little effect on weed populations, but cost much in terms of labour and energy. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the seasonal variation in bud sprouting capacity after fragmentation.

Models that exclude DD or use generic DD functions for populations in which density may be an important form of regulation may introduce bias into management decisions. Understanding the interaction between DD and stressors on demographic endpoints is needed to ensure models applied in management have the potential to detect compensatory or synergistic interactions between the two. This relationship was explored through the development of a DD demographic model for the sheepshead minnow (Cyprinodon variegatus) containing data-defined functions of DD for adult survival, fecundity, and growth. Concentration response curves were developed for organism-level effects from chronic laboratory studies with four chemicals (estradiol, trenbolone, trifluralin, chlordane) causing impacts that vary in endpoint and magnitude. Concentration-response curves were also developed for three hypothetical chemicals (HC) that affected only adult survival (HC-A), fecundity (HC-B), or juvenile growth (HC-C). Population growth rate (PGR) was determined across a range of densities and concentrations for each chemical. PGR contours revealed potential DD-stressor interactions ranging from compensatory to synergistic, which were a function of the combination of DD forms applied in the model and the organism-level impacts of the stressor. Simulations of population projections verified the potential compensatory and synergistic interactions of density and stressors depicted by the PGR contours. The strongest compensation occurred where survival was both DD and impacted by the stressor. When DD survival was omitted, DD fecundity and growth were drivers of PGR, but had limited compensatory influence. These interactions reflect the importance of DD demographic rates to population projections, which should be incorporated into models applied in the management of species in which density may be an important population driver.

While potentially providing suitable habitat such as early-successional forest, infrastructure also enables human access, which may modify animal' movements, especially where hunted species are concerned. To investigated the effect of infrastructure for moose (Alces alces, n = 138), a heavily harvested species, we modelled circadian distances and movement rates over the year as a function of moose' distance to the nearest road, house and power line in different human-modified landscapes in Sweden (latitude 57-67). Distances between moose and roads followed a circadian pattern. Animals were more likely to be closer to roads between 18:00 in the evening and 6:00 in the morning (i.e., during times when traffic volumes are generally lower). Moose moved relatively faster when 125 m or closer to a road, or alternatively, were closer to roads when more active. We did not find these relationships between moose and houses or power lines. With respect to roads, our results suggest that moose may make a temporal adjustment. During hours when humans are less active, road-near habitats may be sought out. We suggest considering different resolutions to study the impact of different infrastructure types. We recommend future research to investigate animal movement and behaviour in relation to infrastructure to understand the utilization of human-modified habitats over time, and thus providing key information for wildlife management and conservation, particularly for species that are adapted to disturbed landscapes.

Impact from invasive alien predators has a strong association with impact from native predators, indicating that similarity in autecology affects co-occurrences between threats. The threat from invasive predators is disassociated from intrinsic factors on islands, probably because species suffering from for instance inbreeding problems have low densities and rarely encounter invasive alien predators. The analysis of co-occurrence of impact from invasive alien species and other threats is a first step to understand and mitigate vulnerability of a community to the simultaneous exposure to invasive alien species and other threats.

This is particularly true in terms of the prevalence and severity of infectious disease, as stressors in combination will not always act to simply decrease the immune function of a host, but may instead interact to compound or even oppose the influence of parasitism on the health of an organism. Here, we explore the impact of environmental stress on host-parasite interactions using the water flea Daphnia magna and it is obligate parasite Pasteuria ramosa. Utilising an ecologically relevant stressor, we focus on the combined effect of salinity and P. ramosa on the fecundity and survival of the host, as well as on patterns of infectivity and the proliferation of the parasite. We show that in the absence of the parasite, host fecundity and survival was highest in the low salinity treatments. Once a parasite was introduced into the environment, however, salinity and parasitism acted antagonistically to influence both host survival and fecundity, and these patterns of disease were unrelated to infection rates or parasite spore loads. By summarising the form of interactions found in the broader Daphnia literature, we highlight how the combined effect of stress and parasitism will vary with the type of stressor, the trait used to describe the health of Daphnia and the host-parasite combination under observation.

Acer negundo, a North American tree, has widely invaded riparian forests throughout Europe at the ecotone between early- (Salix spp. and Populus spp.) and late-successional (Fraxinus spp.) species. However, it is not present in the upper part of the Rhone River, where native Alnus incana occurs at an intermediate position along the successional riparian gradient. Is this absence of the invasive tree due to environmental or biotic resistance of the recipient communities, and in particular due to the presence of Alnus? Location Upper Rhone River, France. Methods We undertook a transplant experiment in an Alnus-dominated community along the Upper Rhone River, where we compared Acer negundo survival and growth, with and without biotic interactions (tree and herb layer effects), to those of four native tree species from differing successional positions in the Upper Rhone communities (P. alba, S. alba, F. excelsior and Alnus incana). Results Without biotic interactions Acer negundo performed similarly to native species, suggesting that the Upper Rhone floodplain is not protected from Acer invasion by a simple abiotic barrier. In contrast, this species performed less well than F. excelsior and Alnus incana in environments with intact tree and/or herb layers. Alnus showed the best growth rate in these conditions, indicating biotic resistance of the native plant community. Conclusions We did not find evidence for an abiotic barrier to Acer negundo invasion of the Upper Rhone River floodplain communities, but our results suggest a biotic resistance.

To determine how wildfire affects amphibians and their parasites, and whether effects differ between protected and managed landscapes, we compared abundance of two amphibians and two nematodes relative to wildfire extent and severity around wetlands in neighboring protected and managed forests (Montana, USA).

In contrast, breeding population sizes of Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris) increased with burn extent in both protected and managed protected forests. Path analysis showed that the effects of wildfire on the two species of nematodes were consistent with differences in their life history and transmission strategies and the responses of their hosts. Burn severity indirectly reduced abundance of soil-transmitted Cosmocercoides variabilis through reductions in salamander abundance. Burn severity also directly reduced C. variabilis abundance, possibly though changes in soil conditions. For the aquatically transmitted nematode Gyrinicola batrachiensis, the positive effect of burn extent on density of Columbia spotted frog larvae indirectly increased parasite abundance. Our results show that effects of wildfire on amphibians depend upon burn extent and severity, isolation, and prior land use. Through subsequent effects on the parasites, our results also reveal how changes in disturbance regimes can affect communities across trophic levels.",1,2013,23,2,479,492"Westbrook, CJ; Veatch, W; Morrison, A",Ecohydrology Bearings - Invited Commentary Is ecohydrology missing much of the zoo?,ECOHYDROLOGY,Article,"Ecohydrology is now recognized as an interdisciplinary field, and as it grows, there needs to be greater awareness and dialogue on its focus and future direction. To take a bearings' on where we are, 339 ecohydrological articles published between January 2000 and December 2011 in two databases were surveyed. We found that 72% of the studies address questions at the interface of plant ecology and hydrology. The scarcity of studies of animals as drivers of hydrological patterns and processes led us to question the reasons behind plant-based ecologists embracing the term ecohydrology to a greater extent than animal-based ecologists. Following that discussion are current examples of synergies between animal ecologists and hydrologists that have led to a greater understanding of ecosystem processes and a way for ecohydrologists to factor in faunal interactions in their future research. We end by suggesting that ecohydrology form its own scientific society so it can more purposely advance knowledge and understanding of coupled ecological and hydrological system functions.

Theory assumes that all individuals within a population have the same mutation rate, but this assumption may not be true. Compared with individuals in high condition, those in poor condition may have fewer resources available to invest in DNA repair, resulting in elevated mutation rates. Alternatively, environmentally induced stress can result in increased investment in DNA repair at the expense of reproduction. Here, we directly test whether sexual harassment by males, known to reduce female condition, affects female capacity to alleviate DNA damage in Drosophila melanogaster fruitflies. Female gametes can repair double-strand DNA breaks in sperm, which allows manipulating mutation rate independently from female condition. We show that male harassment strongly not only reduces female fecundity, but also reduces the yield of dominant lethal mutations, supporting the hypothesis that stressed organisms invest relatively more in repair mechanisms. We discuss our results in the light of previous research and suggest that social effects such as density and courtship can play an important and underappreciated role in mediating condition-dependent mutation rate.",1,2013,280,1750,,"Alsterberg, C; Sundback, K",Experimental warming and toxicant exposure can result in antagonistic effects in a shallow-water sediment system,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,Article,"It has been suggested that future warming will exacerbate the effect of local stressors such as toxicants. In this study the individual and combined effects of warming (+4 degrees C above ambient) and a toxicant (the antifouling substance copper pyrithione) on natural intact shallow-water sediment were studied in an outdoor flow-through facility. Functional (oxygen and inorganic nutrient fluxes in light and dark, bacterial production) and structural (biomass and composition of microphytobenthos and meiofauna) variables were measured. Warming was found to modify the toxicant response antagonistically, i.e. warming removed the negative effect of the toxicant exposure. This antagonism was found for functions depending on light (gross primary production, 24 h net oxygen fluxes, oxygen and silica fluxes). Most functional variables were, however, affected by warming alone, while structural variables were affected by the toxicant alone. At the end of the experiment, the system had 2 types of microalgal communities, a typical benthic algal mat and a floating periphytic mat. Both the benthic and floating microalgal mats were significantly affected by the toxicant alone, but in opposite directions. The biomass of the benthic algal mat was significantly higher under toxicant exposure, whereas the biomass of the floating periphytic mat was lower. Our results suggest that the effects of toxicants in aquatic environments may be reduced (rather than amplified) by warming. We also show that autotrophic communities can respond differently within the same ecosystem and that habitat may determine the mode of response to warming-toxicant exposures in aquatic environments.",1,2013,488,,89,101"Blumstein, DT; Bryant, GA; Kaye, P",The sound of arousal in music is context-dependent,BIOLOGY LETTERS,Article,"Humans, and many non-human animals, produce and respond to harsh, unpredictable, nonlinear sounds when alarmed, possibly because these are produced when acoustic production systems (vocal cords and syrinxes) are overblown in stressful, dangerous situations. Humans can simulate nonlinearities in music and soundtracks through the use of technological manipulations. Recent work found that film soundtracks from different genres differentially contain such sounds. We designed two experiments to determine specifically how simulated nonlinearities in soundtracks influence perceptions of arousal and valence. Subjects were presented with emotionally neutral musical exemplars that had neither noise nor abrupt frequency transitions, or versions of these musical exemplars that had noise or abrupt frequency upshifts or downshifts experimentally added. In a second experiment, these acoustic exemplars were paired with benign videos. Judgements of both arousal and valence were altered by the addition of these simulated nonlinearities in the first, music-only, experiment. In the second, multi-modal, experiment, valence (but not arousal) decreased with the addition of noise or frequency downshifts. Thus, the presence of a video image suppressed the ability of simulated nonlinearities to modify arousal. This is the first study examining how nonlinear simulations in music affect emotional judgements. These results demonstrate that the perception of potentially fearful or arousing sounds is influenced by the perceptual context and that the addition of a visual modality can antagonistically suppress the response to an acoustic stimulus.",1,2012,8,5,744,747"Jentsch, A; Steinbauer, MJ; Alt, M; Retzer, V; Buhk, C; Beierkuhnlein, C",A systematic approach to relate plant-species diversity to land use diversity across landscapes,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,Article,"Land use change is a major driver of biodiversity patterns, therefore conservation management in cultivated landscapes should seek to optimize land use diversity. Especially under changing environmental conditions there is an increasing need of identifying management options for preserving biodiversity. However, the design of historical data sets is often inappropriate for detecting biodiversity responses to ongoing rapid changes. Here, we present an approach to quantify plant species diversity and relate it to land use diversity. Data mining took place at the landscape scale in two mountainous regions of Central Europe, differing in natural and cultural history. Within these landscapes a representative systematic rectangular grid (7 x 7 plots of 1 ha) was sampled. At each plot polygons of uniform land use were mapped and presence-absence data of plant species were recorded. Plant species diversity differed significantly between landscapes: species richness and within landscape beta diversity in the calcareous mosaic landscape was higher than in the siliceous mosaic landscape. Land use diversity explained the significant variation in species richness. The relationship between plant species diversity and land use diversity is consistent in different cultivated landscapes and on multiple scales. The chosen sampling approach integrates the advantage of random but grid-based sampling with land use polygon specific information. This enables not only to investigate also similarity pattern (in land use and species composition) but also an integration of further information on the patch scale, if needed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Within this context, extensive research in rodent models and humans has shown that intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) caused by nutrient restriction during early development is often followed by post-natal catch-up growth when access to food resources improves. However, this accelerated growth rate seems to come at a cost, as metabolic and endocrine processes that are programmed during this time cause later-life onset of diseases such as obesity, insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease (reviewed in Crespi & Denver 2005). In this issue Molecular Ecology, Geiger (2012) asked what are the costs of catch-up growth in nutrient-restricted king penguin chicks (Fig.similar to 1) by measuring lengths of telomeres, the protective DNA sequences at the end of chromosomes, before and after catch-up growth, as the amount and rate of telomere sequence loss over time has been associated with reduced lifespan in both model and nonmodel organisms (see reviews of Costantini 2010; Haussmann & Marchetto 2010). Geiger (2011) found that chicks entering the post-winter growth season at a smaller size exhibited increased growth rates (i.e. catch-up growth) at the cost of increased oxidative stress and reduced telomere lengths compared with the chicks entering the growth period at a larger size. Furthermore, chicks that did not survive had drastically shorter telomere lengths and reduced antioxidant capacities at the beginning of the growth period than all other chicks, thereby directly associating telomere length to mortality. These results suggest that while catch-up growth allows smaller chicks to head off into the world on equal footing with chicks that hatched at a larger size, it likely comes at the cost of a shortened lifespan. Thus, this study provides a mechanism that supports the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of senescence (Promislow 2004).",1,2012,21,6,1307,1310"Moreau, G; Bjorkman, C",Nonadditive interactions between trophic levels bias the appraisal of the strength of mortality factors,POPULATION ECOLOGY,Article,"The role of bottom-up and top-down factors in determining the abundance of organisms is still often evaluated in terms of the nominal (i.e., apparent) cause of death. To determine whether estimates of mortality can be influenced by nonadditive multitrophic interactions, we generated both marginal (i.e., the entirety of mortality attributable to a given factor, including its obscured fraction) and nominal estimates of the trophic forces acting on an herbivore. This was accomplished by comparing mortality rates of the willow leaf beetle Phratora vulgatissima on willows affected or relatively unaffected by local growing conditions, in the presence or absence of natural enemies. Marginal estimates indicated that bottom-up and top-down mortality factors interacted in a synergistic or compensatory way, with the nature of the interaction varying in response to the time elapsed since the last harvest of willow plantations. In contrast, nominal estimates could not discriminate synergistic and compensatory interactions from top-down influence. Combined with recent evidence of compensatory mortality between trophic forces in another system, this study suggests that nonadditive effects between bottom-up and top-down mortality factors may be common, offering an explanation through which the contrasting evidences previously presented by proponents of the bottom-up and top-down views can be understood.",1,2012,54,1,125,133"Carlon, DB; Budd, AF; Lippe, C; Andrew, RL",THE QUANTITATIVE GENETICS OF INCIPIENT SPECIATION: HERITABILITY AND GENETIC CORRELATIONS OF SKELETAL TRAITS IN POPULATIONS OF DIVERGING FAVIA FRAGUM ECOMORPHS,EVOLUTION,Article,"Recent speciation events provide potential opportunities to understand the microevolution of reproductive isolation.

Considering both ecomorphs, we found significant narrow-sense heritability (h2) in a suite of measurements that define corallite architecture, and could partition additive and nonadditive variation for some traits. We found positive genetic correlations for homologous height and length measurements among different types of vertical plates (costosepta) within corallites, but negative correlations between height and length within, as well as between costosepta. Within ecomorphs, h2 estimates were generally lower, compared to the combined ecomorph analysis. Marker-based estimates of h2 were comparable to broad-sense heritability (H) obtained from parentoffspring regressions in a common garden for most traits, and similar genetic co-variance matrices for common garden and wild populations may indicate relatively small G x E interactions.

Macrofaunal assemblages were impoverished and their distribution highly patchy across stations and months. Molluscs, arthropods and echinoderms were scarce, but small-size opportunistic polychaete species such as Polydora sp. and Streblospio benedicti were predominant. The synergistic effects of low hydrodynamics and hypoxia derived from organic enrichment probably explain the distribution patterns of macrofauna. Heavy metal contamination appears to have minor effects on fauna; low bioavailability of metals and tolerance of fauna can explain this hypothesis. Seasonal changes of macrofauna can be related to water stagnation in the wet (summer) period and concomitant increase of hypoxia.

The use of native species for rehabilitation can be preferable because non-native species are often less suited to the local environment and can pose a threat to the integrity of adjacent ecosystems. Native multispecies sod could become a useful rehabilitation tool, but research is needed to determine which species to use and the appropriate number of species to include. Mixtures of 4-7 native species were grown for 7 months, and clipped dry biomass, species percent abundance, and total ground cover were assessed over time in order to determine the suitability of 20 native species for sod production.

Today, more than 32% of amphibian species are threatened and more than 43% face a steep decline in numbers. Most species are being affected simultaneously by multiple stressors and habitat protection is often inadequate to prevent declines. Aims. The main goal of the present research was to understand the consequences of alternative human land use in producing landscape disturbance for amphibians. At the same time, we also evaluated the effect of changing climatic conditions as additional potential drivers of population decline. Another goal was to determine whether and to what extent the existing nature reserves have been effective in protecting species in recent decades. Methods. We used generalised additive models (GAMs) to investigate the association between the state (stable/decline) of amphibian populations in 5 x 5 km cells in central Italy and proxies of different typology of anthropogenic stressors, climatic variables and protection measures. Key results. We found a significant association between anthropogenic landscape modifications and species decline. This negative relationship was revealed with agricultural predictors for the majority of the species, whereas urban fabrics had a slightly smaller impact. We found significant associations between amphibian declines and climatic variation, particularly the increasing number of dry days. Protected areas protected declines of two species only. Conclusions. Our results showed that the status of amphibians in this region warrants greater attention than has been given previously. The detrimental effect of agricultural practices, combined with increasing aridity, makes amphibian populations particularly susceptible to extinction, and the conservation measures applied till now are inadequate for species protection in this region.

Corticosterone is a glucocorticoid hormone, released in response to stress. Mifepristone (Ru 38486), inhibits the actions of this hormone. Imposed stress as well as administration of corticosterone, decreased consumption. Concurrent administration of mifepristone prevented these decreases. Mifepristone in low doses increased aversion in stressed, but not unstressed rats. At high doses, mifepristone both increased consumption and decreased aversion in all rats following exposure to 1080. Administration of corticosterone also produced dose-dependent effects on aversion.

There has been an ongoing discussion concerning the relative importance of these processes in controlling the dynamics of giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, an important structure-forming species on shallow reefs in the eastern Pacific. We used novel spatial time-series that span nearly three decades to determine the dominant drivers of giant kelp canopy biomass and the temporal and spatial scales over which they operate across the dominant range of the giant kelp in North America. LocationNear-shore areas from Ano Nuevo, California, to the USA/Mexico border. MethodsWe employed empirical orthogonal functions to elucidate the primary drivers of giant kelp canopy biomass across space and time and then fit generalized additive and linear models to determine the nonlinear effect and relative importance of each of these potential drivers along the c. 1500-km study region over a 25-year period. ResultsWave disturbance, nitrate availability and the state of the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation were the most important environmental predictors of giant kelp canopy biomass, explaining 24.5%, 12.7% and 6.1% of the variance, respectively. Environmental drivers of canopy biomass exhibited profound spatial differences in relative effect sizes. Nonlinear effect shapes of each potential biomass driver were determined, which explained these spatial differences. Main conclusionsThese large-scale analyses help to reconcile the local-scale conclusions of canopy biomass dynamics across the California coastline and show that these dynamics differ predictably in space and time in accordance with local and regional differences in environmental drivers.

Here, we review evidence of interactions between invasive predators and six key threats that together have strong potential to influence both the impacts of the predators, and their management. We show that impacts of invasive predators can be classified as either functional or numerical, and that they interact with other threats through both habitat- and community-mediated pathways. Ecosystem context and invasive predator identity are central in shaping variability in these relationships and their outcomes. Greater recognition of the ecological complexities between major processes that threaten biodiversity, including changing spatial and temporal relationships among species, is required to both advance ecological theory and improve conservation actions and outcomes.

To understand such changes we investigated the effects on top soils of three hydro-geomorphological units that are typical for floodplains: depression, levee, and plateau. They show distinct characteristics regarding soil type, trace element (TE) pollution level and hydrology. In the laboratory we used an automated biogeochemical microcosm set up to simulate oxidized-reduced cycles to monitor the effects of strong fluctuating redox potential (EH), on pH, iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), sulfur (S), nitrate (NO3), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved concentrations of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), and zinc (Zn) in the soil solution.

Both could be mainly allocated to their explicit spatial characteristics; due to differences in its buffer capacities and to the interaction between pH-value and microbial activity. In particular, we could demonstrate that a combination of several biogeochemical factors may influence TE release or retention in floodplain soils by means of generalized additive models (GAMs). Using those, Fe and S were identified as most important factors that determined the dynamics of TEs in all three studied soils; concentrations of As, Cu, Cr, Ni, and Zn increased with increasing Fe-concentrations whereas Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni, and Zn seem correspondingly to be dependent on S that went along with the course of the oxidized-reduced cycle. Still, several uncertainties between environmental changes and TE release from floodplain soils may exist. Thus, the fate of dissolved TEs in river-floodplain ecosystems needs to be taken under serious consideration since the ecotoxicology threat of them is of undisputed risk. a 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To contribute to closing this gap, this study applies a methodology for exploring complex linkages between ecosystem services and human wellbeing. This builds on emerging frameworks for studying multiple dimensions of human wellbeing, drawing on Amartya Sen's capabilities approach to human development. The approach is applied to an empirical case study of three sites adjacent to native tropical forest in western Rwanda. The value of exploring social complexity in ecosystem services research is illustrated through its contribution to understanding a) different types of values; b) disaggregation of people; c) power relations and their influence on trade-offs; d) the importance of multiple land use types in the landscape; and e) changes and their drivers at multiple scales. The analysis reveals that the majority of services valued by forest-adjacent Rwandan inhabitants are not provided by tropical forests but by other habitats. We suggest that more integrated landscape governance may offer synergistic opportunities for conservation and development. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

An accurate conceptualization of fragmented landscapes requires consideration of the age and origin of the fragments, i.e., direct fragmentation or reverse fragmentation (generation or increase of vegetated fragments by colonization), and the habitat modifications of fragment species (autogenic processes). Colonization and autogenic processes alter the fragments' composition and function. Fragment metrics affect colonization. Autogenic processes are antagonized by disturbances and modulated by abiotic inputs. Fragment alterations by autogenic processes may explain the continuous species substitution detected in some fragments or the species persistence in others. Reverse fragmentation, a natural process in commonly disturbed landscapes, challenges the avoidance-of-habitat disturbance as the ultimate strategy for biodiversity conservation and stresses the importance of pioneer species that promote succession as resilience elements in fragmented landscapes. Among-fragment diversity, generated by local disturbances, can be essential for the resilience of fragmented landscapes, suggesting that conservation and habitat utilization can be complementary processes. Traditional agroforestry systems that depend on disturbance, fragmentation, colonization, and autogenic processes may provide important insights into fragmentation ecology.",0,2015,25,6,1447,1455"Foster, CN; Barton, PS; Wood, JT; Lindenmayer, DB",Interactive effects of fire and large herbivores on web-building spiders,OECOLOGIA,Article,"Altered disturbance regimes are a major driver of biodiversity loss worldwide. Maintaining or re-creating natural disturbance regimes is therefore the focus of many conservation programmes. A key challenge, however, is to understand how co-occurring disturbances interact to affect biodiversity. We experimentally tested for the interactive effects of prescribed fire and large macropod herbivores on the web-building spider assemblage of a eucalypt forest understorey and investigated the role of vegetation in mediating these effects using path analysis. Fire had strong negative effects on the density of web-building spiders, which were partly mediated by effects on vegetation structure, while negative effects of large herbivores on web density were not related to changes in vegetation. Fire amplified the effects of large herbivores on spiders, both via vegetation-mediated pathways and by increasing herbivore activity. The importance of vegetation-mediated pathways and fire-herbivore interactions differed for web density and richness and also differed between web types. Our results demonstrate that for some groups of web-building spiders, the effects of co-occurring disturbance drivers may be mostly additive, whereas for other groups, interactions between drivers can amplify disturbance effects. In our study system, the use of prescribed fire in the presence of high densities of herbivores could lead to reduced densities and altered composition of web-building spiders, with potential cascading effects through the arthropod food web.

Individual management interventions can influence this balance by altering some, but not all of these potential drivers. For example, no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) on coral reefs can increase herbivorous fish abundance, thereby decreasing macroalgal coverage, but have limited influence on water quality and other vagile drivers. We compared the relative influence of seven abiotic water quality variables to that of MPA status on macroalgal coverage in 14 sites (5 of which are within no-take MPAs) over four consecutive seasons (summer through to spring) within the marginal coral reef habitats of Moreton Bay, Australia. Algal cover was quantified by taking 100 photo quadrats per site per sampling with the relative importance of our eight factors determined statistically by generalised additive models. Overall, temporal variations in total macroalgal cover and four out of five important macroalgal genera correlated with factors other than marine protection, especially water temperature, salinity, water clarity (Secchi disc) and nutrient concentration (nitrogen and phosphorus). However, seasonal variations in cover of individual macroalgal genera did not follow strong temporal trends and were not consistent with total macroalgal cover, meaning that different factors were significant for different algal genera. Consequently, we advocate for caution in determining the influence of impact gradients by exclusively measuring total macroalgal cover.

We then applied a generalized linear modeling framework and constructed cumulative effects models capable of predicting in-stream response to future surface-mine development within the context of other landuse activities. Predictive models provided precise estimates of specific conductance (model R-2 <= 0.77 and cross-validated R-2 <= 0.74), Se (0.74 and 0.70), and benthic macroinvertebrate community composition (0.72 and 0.65). Deletion tests supported the conclusion that stream degradation across the region is the result of complex, but predictable, additive and interactive effects of surface mining, underground mining, and residential development. Furthermore, we found that as stressors other than surface mining are factored out completely, the surface-mining level that results in exceedance of the 300 mu S/cm conductivity benchmark increased from 4.4% in the presence of other stressors to 16.6% when only surface mining was present. Last, extrapolating model results to all unsampled stream segments in the region (n = 26,135), we predicted high levels of chemical (33%) and biological (67%) impairment to streams on the current landscape.

While many single-factor studies have quantified ecosystem responses to single global change drivers, less is known about the interaction effects of these drivers on ecosystem functions. Here, we present the results of a three-year field and a two-year glasshouse experiment, in which we assessed responses of Calluna vulgaris heathlands to the single and combined effects of drought events (D) and N fertilization (D: 25% precipitation reduction in the field experiment and 20-50% soil water content reduction in the glasshouse experiment; N fertilization: 35kg N ha(-1)year(-1)). We examined the effects of D and N treatments on growth responses of the dominant dwarf shrub Calluna vulgaris (in terms of biomass production and allocation, tissue C-13 signatures and C:N ratios) in relation to two plant life-history stages and different ecotypes' (sub-Atlantic vs. subcontinental heathlands). Plant responses varied strongly with life-history stage, and the interaction of N and D showed lower effects than would be expected based on additive responses to single factors. While D treatments had no effects on Calluna in the building phase (ca. ten-year-old plants), seedlings (particularly one-year-old plants) were highly susceptible to drought. Differences in response patterns were attributable to the high shoot-root ratios typical of young Calluna plants. These ratios decreased with progressing life history as a result of increasing below-ground biomass investments. Below-ground biomass production and shoot-root ratios differed between plants from the different heathland sites. Tissue C-13 signatures decreased and C:N ratios increased with plant age as a result of decreasing evaporative demands (per unit root biomass). N fertilization increases the shoot-root ratios and thereby the drought susceptibility of Calluna plants.Synthesis. Our findings suggest that plant responses to global change are difficult to anticipate by means of single-factor studies or by focusing on a single life-history stage.

An experimental manipulation of the inherent correlation between genotype and environment,EVOLUTION,Article,"The optimal timing of the seasonal switch from somatic growth to reproduction can depend on an individual's condition at reproduction, the quality of the environment in which it will reproduce, or both. In annual plants, vegetative size (a function of age at flowering) affects resources available for seed production, whereas exposure to mutualists, antagonists, and abiotic stresses in the environment (functions of Julian date of flowering) influences success in converting resources into offspring. The inherent tight correlation between age, size, and environment obscures their independent fitness contributions. We isolated the fitness effects of these factors by experimentally manipulating the correlation between age at flowering and date of flowering in Brassica rapa. We staggered the planting dates of families with differing ages at flowering to produce experimental populations in which age at flowering and date of flowering were positively, negatively, or uncorrelated. In all populations, plants with an early date of flowering produced more seed than those flowering late, regardless of age or size at flowering onset. The temporal environment was thus the principal driver of selection on flowering time, but its importance relative to that of age and size varied with the presence/absence of herbivores and seed predators.",0,2015,69,8,2018,2033"Bennett, JR; Shaw, JD; Terauds, A; Smol, JP; Aerts, R; Bergstrom, DM; Blais, JM; Cheung, WWL; Chown, SL; Lea, MA; Nielsen, UN; Pauly, D; Reimer, KJ; Riddle, MJ; Snape, I; Stark, JS; Tulloch, VJ; Possingham, HP",Polar lessons learned: long-term management based on shared threats in Arctic and Antarctic environments,FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT,Review,"The Arctic and Antarctic polar regions are subject to multiple environmental threats, arising from both local and ex-situ human activities.

Given the lack of progress in reducing global atmospheric greenhouse-gas emissions, we suggest that managing the threats that interact synergistically with climate change, and that are potentially more tractable, is all the more important in the short to medium term for polar conservation. We show how evidence-based lessons learned from scientific research can be shared between the poles on topics such as contaminant mitigation, biosecurity protocols to reduce species invasions, and the regulation of fisheries and marine environments.

Even though empirical evidence is scarce, theory predicts that the importance of both top-down and bottom-up forces may decrease as physical stress increases. Here, we experimentally evaluate in the field the separate and interactive effect of salinity, nutrient availability, and crab herbivory on plant above-and belowground biomass, as well as on sexual and clonal reproduction in the salt marsh plant Spartina densiflora. Results show that the outcome of the interaction between nutrient availability and herbivory is highly context dependent, not only varying with the abiotic context (i.e., with or without increased salinity stress), but also with the dependent variable considered. Contrary to theoretical predictions, our results show that, consistently across different measured variables, salinity stress did not cancel bottom-up (i.e., nutrients) or top-down (i.e., consumers) control, but has additive effects. Our results support emerging theory by highlighting that, under many conditions, physical stress can act additively with, or even stimulate, consumer control, especially in cases where the physical stress is only experienced by basal levels of the trophic chain.

Opposing theories predict that invaders can either hinder or promote one another's success. Additionally, evidence suggests that co-occurring invaders can interact to amplify or mitigate one another's impacts on ecosystems. However, there has not been a quantitative review on interactions among multiple invasive animals. Here I use a meta-analysis approach to show that, across a global scale, the mean interaction among invaders was to reduce one another's performance. This pattern was consistent when considering interactions between marine animals but interactions were neutral overall in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. Crucially, individual studies showed that neutral interactions were the most common interaction type. Further, I demonstrate that the combined ecological impacts of multiple invaders were frequently the sum of their independent effects (additive) but the mean effect was non-additive and less than predicted (antagonistic). In both meta-analyses, the disparity between the most frequent and mean interaction type indicates that case studies of multiple invasions commonly have different outcomes to global trends.

Observations of high density of the invasive springtail (Collembola), Hypogastrura manubrialis in heavily grazed renosterveld vegetation in the Western Cape, South Africa, raised the question of whether the invasion was favored by changes in plant litter quality associated with habitat disturbance in this vegetation type. To examine the likely mechanisms underlying the high abundance of H.manubrialis, cages with three types of naturally occurring litter with different nutrient content were placed out in the area and collected after different periods of time. Hypogastrura manubrialis was mainly found in the nutrient-rich litter of the yellowbush (Galenia africana), which responds positively to disturbance in the form of overgrazing. This suggests that invasion may have been facilitated by a positive interaction with this grazing resistant plant. By contrast, indigenous Collembola were least abundant in yellowbush litter. Negative correlations between high abundance of H.manubrialis and the abundance and diversity of other species suggest that competitive interactions might underlie low abundance of these other species at the patch level. Group behavior enables H.manubrialis to utilize efficiently this ephemeral, high quality resource, and might improve its competitive ability. The results suggest that interactions among environmental change drivers may lead to unforeseen invasion effects. H.manubrialis is not likely to be very successful in un-grazed renosterveld, but in combination with grazing, favoring the nutrient-rich yellowbush, it may become highly invasive.

However, we hypothesized that, even if novel communities emerge, those communities may not be novel in terms of functional composition. To infer the processes associated with rising temperatures, we evaluated elevational taxonomic/functional turnover of plant and invertebrate communities. Because climate change interacts synergistically with other environmental factors, and therefore is not the sole driver of change in ecological communities, we also considered how the taxonomic/functional composition of the communities would be affected by mammalian overgrazing/browsing, which has become prominent in the study region. LocationShiretoko National Park, Shiretoko Peninsular, Hokkaido, Japan. MethodsWe investigated the diversity of eight groups of organisms (taxa) in forests of northern Japan, and calculated the distance decay of taxonomic/functional similarity (SOrensen's -diversity) along an elevational gradient. A null model was used to separate functional turnover from taxonomic turnover. We then simulated how taxonomic/functional turnover along the gradient would be changed after non-random loss of species sensitive to mammalian herbivory. ResultsWe found that each group showed elevational decay in taxonomic similarity. Along an elevational gradient, species groups structured by stronger dispersal limitation showed faster species turnover. This suggested differences in the process of climate-induced species reassembly among the groups. We also found that elevational turnover of communities based on functional traits tended to be lower than that based on taxonomic identity for the majority of the groups, supporting our hypothesis of functional redundancy across the elevational gradient. We thus speculated that climate-induced emergence of taxonomically novel communities may have limited influence on critical ecosystem processes supported by functional diversity. Furthermore, while random species loss did not change functional turnover, non-random loss of species attributable to mammalian herbivory substantially accelerated elevational functional turnover of the taxa. This suggested a possible loss of the functional redundancy of communities.

Analyzing data from Pacific Fisheries Information Network between 1990 and 2010, we show that over 17 million kg of fish and shellfish were kept for personal use. We used general additive models to examine patterns in proportion of personal use versus price for the top 10 species retained over the 20-year period for each of the three population groups: Washington commercial tribal (indigenous) fishing operators, Washington commercial nontribal operators, and California commercial fishing operators. Out of the 26 species-price relationships tested, only one fits the market relationship with statistical significance and the model failed to predict personal use patterns for any of the other species. We conclude that market sensitivity is not a reliable predictor for subsistence behavior. Although a nominal figure in the overall seafood catch, the presence of subsistence practices among 21st century market-based commercial fishing operators reveals a more diverse array of economic systems than previously imagined. We suggest that alternative economies, including subsistence and associated community share systems, function to improve human wellbeing and strengthen community resilience by increasing food security and community food systems, engaging in a quality of life practice, and supporting social networks through seafood gifting and sharing.

Predicting fungal symbiont distributions under future climates first requires knowledge of current distributions and their potential drivers. LocationWe documented colonization by fungal symbionts in perennial, cool-season grasses along altitudinal gradients in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, USA. MethodsAcross seven replicate altitudinal gradients, spanning c.1400 vertical meters, we scored fungal colonization for 46 grass species. We documented altitudinal clines in colonization by both above-ground and below-ground fungal symbionts for the first time, including localized foliar endophytes (LFE) and systemic endophytes (epichloae) in leaves and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate endophytes (DSE) in roots. For a subset of 16 well-sampled grass species, we used model selection procedures to evaluate the relative importance of geography, edaphic factors and host plant identity. We also assessed the influence of host phylogenetic relatedness and colonization by co-infecting fungi. ResultsLevels of fungal colonization varied strongly with host plant identity, but the effects of particular host species were not consistent across fungal groups. In addition to the influence of host identity, epichloae colonization declined with elevation and varied with geography (latitude/longitude) and edaphic factors. Geography and collection date were important predictors of LFE colonization, with higher colonization later in the growing season. Colonization estimates for the obligately plant-associated fungi (epichloae, AMF) were phylogenetically conserved across the grass supertree. Positive correlations between AMF and DSE, which remained even after accounting for host plant relatedness, suggested possible synergisms between these fungal groups.

Yet, the ecological drivers of this small-scale heterogeneity of interaction patterns and their outcomes remain virtually unexplored. We analyzed spatial structure in the frequency and intensity of interactions that vertebrate pollinators (birds and lizards) and invertebrate antagonists (florivores, nectar larcenists, and seed predators) had when interacting with the insular plant Isoplexis canariensis, and their effect on plant fitness. Spatially autocorrelated variation in plant reproductive success (fruit and viable seed set) emerged from the combined action of mutualists and antagonists, rather than reflecting the spatial pattern of any specific animal group. However, the influence of antagonists on plant fitness was stronger primarily due to the florivores' action on earlier reproductive stages, consuming and damaging floral structures before the arrival of pollinators. Our results indicate that the early action of antagonists creates hotspots of increased plant damage, where the effects of later acting mutualists are not translated into increased reproductive benefits. We foresee the potential for antagonists to shape the intra-population mosaics of plant fitness in situations where antagonists outnumber mutualists, when their interactions occur before those of mutualists, and when mutualists can detect and avoid damaged plants while foraging. Severely damaged plants in antagonistic hotspots might be excluded from the mating network and render a limited production of viable seeds, reducing both the growth rate of the plant population and the effective population size.",0,2015,96,8,2181,2191"Thomas, BL; Doyle, T; Krauss, K",Annual Growth Patterns of Baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) Along Salinity Gradients,WETLANDS,Article,"The effects of salinity on Taxodium distichum seedlings have been well documented, but few studies have examined mature trees in situ.

However, patterns and causes of -diversity loss, especially at a within-field scale, have remained unexplored. We examined -diversity declines in plants, butterflies and orthopterans resulting from land abandonment and intensification in semi-natural grasslands on paddy margins at a within-field scale in relation to changes in disturbance frequency and surrounding landscapes by surveying eight abandoned, thirteen traditional and ten intensive paddy terraces. Three indices, the additive partitioning of species richness ((add)) and the turnover ((tu)) and nestedness ((ne)) components of Jaccard dissimilarity of plants and herbivores, were used to evaluate different aspects of -diversity. We hypothesized that biotic homogenization due to abandonment and intensification would be expressed as low spatiotemporal (add) and (tu), low spatial (ne) and high temporal (ne). The spatial and temporal (add) of plants and herbivores were higher in traditional terraces than in others. Changes in mowing frequency caused direct declines in butterfly (add) and indirectly decreased herbivore (add) through diminished plant (add) in abandoned and intensified terraces. Neighbouring forests increased plant spatial and butterfly temporal (add) and (tu). Abandoned terraces had higher orthopteran spatial and plant temporal (tu) than traditional terraces. Mowing frequency generally did not influence spatial and temporal (tu) of plants and herbivores. In intensive terraces, temporal (ne) of plants were higher than in traditional terraces, suggesting dominance by plant species sharing similar phenologies.Synthesis and applications. These results suggest that traditional mowing practices are essential for maintaining plant and herbivore (add), and consequently, species pools within terraces. The higher spatial or temporal species turnover of plants and orthopterans in abandoned terraces and higher temporal plant nestedness in intensive than in traditional terraces were not due to increases in species pools within terraces.

Overall, the presence of S. muticum increased assemblage productivity rates and warming altered algal assemblage structure, which was characterised by a decrease in kelp and an increase in ephemeral green algae. The effects of S. muticum on total algal biomass accumulation, however, varied with nutrient enrichment and warming, producing antagonistic cumulative effects on total algal biomass accumulation.

Host-parasite interactions are fundamentally important drivers of evolutionary processes, but a lack of understanding of the genes involved in the host's response to chronic parasite insult makes it particularly difficult to understand the mechanisms of host life history trade-offs and the adaptive dynamics involved. Here, we examine the genetic basis of gastrointestinal nematode (Trichostrongylus tenuis) burden in 695 red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scotica) individuals genotyped at 384 genome-wide SNPs. We first use genome-wide association to identify individual SNPs associated with nematode burden. We then partition genome-wide heritability to identify chromosomes with greater heritability than expected from gene content, due to harbouring a multitude of additive SNPs with individually undetectable effects. We identified five SNPs on five chromosomes that accounted for differences of up to 556 worms per bird, but together explained at best 4.9% of the phenotypic variance. These SNPs were closely linked to genes representing a range of physiological processes including the immune system, protein degradation and energy metabolism. Genome partitioning indicated genome-wide heritability of up to 29% and three chromosomes with excess heritability of up to 4.3% (total 8.9%).

To assess the mechanisms underlying UV photodegradation in a semiarid climate, we exposed high- and low-lignin litter to ambient and blocked UV over 15 months in a Mediterranean ecosystem. We hypothesized that UV would increase litter mass loss, that UV would preferentially increase mass loss of the lignin fraction, and that UV would have a negative effect on microbial activity. Consistent with our first hypothesis, we found that UV-blocking reduced litter mass loss from 16% to 1% in high-lignin litter and from 29% to 17% in low-lignin litter. Contrary to our second hypothesis, UV treatment did not have a significant effect on lignin content in either litter type. Instead, UV-blocking significantly reduced cellulose and hemicellulose mass loss in both litter types. Contrary to our third hypothesis, we observed a positive effect of UV on both fungal abundance and the potential activities of several assayed extracellular enzymes. Additionally, under ambient UV only, we found significant correlations between potential activities of cellulase and oxidase enzymes and both the concentrations and degradation rates of their target compounds. Our results indicate that UV is a significant driver of litter mass loss in Mediterranean ecosystems, but not solely because UV directly degrades carbon compounds such as lignin. Rather, UV facilitates microbial degradation of litter compounds, such as cellulose and hemicellulose. Thus, unexpectedly high rates of litter decomposition previously attributed directly to UV in dryland ecosystems may actually derive from a synergistic interaction between UV and microbes.",0,2015,96,7,1994,2003"Bharti, N; Barnawal, D; Maji, D; Kalra, A",Halotolerant PGPRs Prevent Major Shifts in Indigenous Microbial Community Structure Under Salinity Stress,MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,Article,"The resilience of soil microbial populations and processes to environmental perturbation is of increasing interest as alteration in rhizosphere microbial community dynamics impacts the combined functions of plant-microbe interactions.

Plants inoculated with halotolerant rhizobacteria recorded improved growth as illustrated by significantly higher shoot and root dry weight and elongation in comparison to un-inoculated control plants under both non-saline and saline conditions. Additive main effect and multiplicative interaction ordination analysis revealed that plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) inoculations as well as salinity are major drivers of microbial community shift in maize rhizosphere. Salinity negatively impacts microbial community as analysed through diversity indices; among the PGPR-inoculated plants, STR2-inoculated plants recorded higher values of diversity indices.

We test the interactive effects of diel-cycling hypoxia with both warming and decreased salinities using ecologically realistic exposures. Surprisingly, we found no evidence of negative synergistic effects on Olympia oyster growth; rather, we found only additive and opposing effects of hypoxia (detrimental) and warming (beneficial). We suspect that diel-cycling provided a temporal refuge that allowed physiological compensation. We also tested for latent effects of warming and hypoxia to low-salinity tolerance using a seasonal delay between stressor events. However, we did not find a latent effect, rather a threshold survival response to low salinity that was independent of early life-history exposure to warming or hypoxia. The absence of synergism is likely the result of stressor treatments that mirror the natural timing of environmental stressors. We provide environmental context for laboratory experimental data by examining field time series environmental data from four North American west coast estuaries and find heterogeneous environmental signals that characterize each estuary, suggesting that the potential stressor exposure to oysters will drastically differ over moderate spatial scales. This heterogeneity implies that efforts to conserve and restore oysters will require an adaptive approach that incorporates knowledge of local conditions.

Recently, in vitro assays with primary cultures of coelomocytes based in the neutral red uptake (NRU) assay have been developed as promising tools for toxicity assessment chemical in a reproducible and cost-effective manner. However, NRU showed a bimodal dose-response curve previously described after in vivo and in vitro exposure of earthworm coelomocytes to pollutants. This response could be related with alterations in the relative proportion of coelomocyte subpopulations, amoebocytes and eleocytes. Thus, the aims of the present work were, first, to establish the toxicity thresholds that could be governed by different cell-specific sensitivities of coelomocytes subpopulations against a series of metals (Cu, Cd, Pb, Ni), and second to understand the implication that coelomocyte population dynamics (eleocytes vs. amoebocytes) after exposure to pollutants can have on the viability of coelomocytes (measured by NRU assay) as biomarker of general stress in soil health assessment. Complementarily flow cytometric analyses were applied to obtain correlative information about single cells (amoebocytes and eleocytes) in terms of size and complexity, changes in their relative proportion and mortality rates. The results indicated a clear difference in sensitivity of eleocytes and amoebocytes against metal exposure, being eleocytes more sensitive. The bimodal dose-response curve of NRU after in vitro exposure of primary cultures of coelomocytes to metals revealed an initial mortality of eleocytes (decreased NRU), followed by an increased complexity of amoebocytes (enhanced phagocytosis) and massive mortality of eleocytes (increased NRU), to give raise to a massive mortality of amoebocytes (decrease NRU). A synergistic effect on NRU was exerted by the exposure to high Cu concentrations and acidic pH (elicited by the metal itself), whereas the effects on NRU produced after exposure to Cd, Ni and Pb were due solely to the presence of metals, being the acidification of culture medium meaningless.",0,2015,24,5,1004,1013"Mosser, AA; Kosmala, M; Packer, C",Landscape heterogeneity and behavioral traits drive the evolution of lion group territoriality,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,Article,"All feline species are territorial, but only African lions defend joint territories. We developed a simulation model to explore the conditions that favor the transition to sociality from a solitary ancestry. Two ecological ""drivers,"" population density and landscape heterogeneity, determine the extent to which social groups benefit from monopolizing resource-rich ""hot spots."" However, group territoriality only evolves where individuals remain with their mothers, cooperate to repel neighbors, and expand their territories to maximize access to resources.Group territoriality is exhibited in a diverse range of species and is associated with complex behaviors such as cooperation and altruism. Current hypotheses for the evolutionary transition from solitary to group territoriality consider resource dispersion and population density as the primary drivers. We developed a spatially explicit, agent-based simulation model based on African lions (Panthera leo) to explore the evolution of group territoriality across a range of landscape heterogeneities and population densities. We also examined, within these differing landscapes, how 3 potential behavioral advantages to group territoriality (cooperative defense, increase in territory size, and territorial inheritance) influence the evolution of this trait. Simulation results demonstrate that group territoriality may be an emergent property, which evolves due to synergistic interactions of landscape structure, population density, and behavior. Social individuals were significantly more likely to dominate in both resource-poor and resource-rich, heterogeneous landscapes where individuals exhibit all 3 behavioral traits.

We follow the ideas first laid out by MacArthur and MacArthur in 1961 who found that in the eastern USA higher tree canopies supported more bird species, which they attributed to an increase of available niches as forests grow taller. We test if their findings can be generalized over large regions and other taxa by employing novel methods and using current datasets. LocationGlobal MethodsWe used the global distribution maps of the three above taxa to infer species richness. Our tree canopy height information was derived from remotely sensed LiDAR data. The analysis was conducted globally and within biogeographical realms. We modeled richness, using tree canopy height and other environmental correlates, with generalized additive models and geographically weighted regressions. ResultsGlobally, tree canopy height proved to be of lesser importance in explaining species richness patterns compared to other environmental drivers. Within biogeographical realms, tree canopy height was found to be a more important predictor of diversity in the Neotropic and Australian realms. Regional patterns show that tree canopy height has an important effect on diversity of amphibians throughout the world and in several tropical regions across taxa. Net Primary Productivity (NPP) explains more of the variation in richness both globally and within most regions.

Furthermore, they face environmental challenges that may interact synergistically with deleterious consequences of increased homozygosity and further decrease fitness. Most studies on inbreeding-environment (I-E) interactions use one or two stress levels, whereby the resolution of the possible stress and inbreeding depression interaction is low. Here we produced Drosophila melanogaster replicate populations, maintained at three different population sizes (10, 50 and a control size of 500) for 25 generations. A nutritional stress gradient was imposed on the replicate populations by exposing them to 11 different concentrations of yeast in the developmental medium. We assessed the consequences of nutritional stress by scoring egg-to-adult viability and body mass of emerged flies. We found: (1) unequivocal evidence for I-E interactions in egg-to-adult viability and to a lesser extent in dry body mass, with inbreeding depression being more severe under higher levels of nutritional stress; (2) a steeper increase in inbreeding depression for replicate populations of size 10 with increasing nutritional stress than for replicate populations of size 50; (3) a nonlinear norm of reaction between inbreeding depression and nutritional stress; and (4) a faster increase in number of lethal equivalents in replicate populations of size 10 compared with replicate populations of size 50 with increasing nutritional stress levels.

Using a 105-year data set, we found increasing elevation extent of fires in the Sierra Nevada, and pose five hypotheses to explain this pattern. Beyond the recognized pattern of increasing fire frequency in the Sierra Nevada since the late 20th century, we find that the upper elevation extent of those fires has also been increasing. Factors such as fire season climate and fuel build up are recognized potential drivers of changes in fire regimes. Patterns of warming climate and increasing stand density are consistent with both the direction and magnitude of increasing elevation of wildfire. Reduction in high elevation wildfire suppression and increasing ignition frequencies may also contribute to the observed pattern. Historical biases in fire reporting are recognized, but not likely to explain the observed patterns. The four plausible mechanistic hypotheses (changes in fire management, climate, fuels, ignitions) are not mutually exclusive, and likely have synergistic interactions that may explain the observed changes.

This was attributed to the rapid plant colonization that followed the incorporation of biosolids into exposed regoliths, but the specific mechanisms involved in the stabilization of carbon inputs from the vegetation remained unclear. Using isotopic and elemental analyses, we tested the hypothesis that plant-derived carbon accumulation was triggered by the formation of iron-coordinated complexes, stabilized into physically protected (occluded) soil fractions. Confirming this hypothesis, we identified a fast formation of microaggregates shortly after the application of iron-rich biosolids, which was characterized by a strong association between pyrophosphate-extractable iron and plant-derived organic matter. The formation of microaggregates preceded the development of macroaggregates, which drastically increased soil carbon content (similar to 140 Mg C/ha) a few years after restoration. Consistent with previous theoretical work, iron-coordinated organic complexes served as nuclei for aggregate formation, reflecting the synergistic effect of biological, chemical, and physical mechanisms of carbon stabilization in developing soils. Nevertheless, iron was not the only factor affecting soil carbon content. The highest carbon accumulation was observed during the period of highest plant diversity (>30 species; years 3-6), declining significantly with the exclusion of native species by invasive grasses (years 9-14). Furthermore, the increasing dominance of invasive grasses was associated with a steady decline in the concentration of soil nitrogen and phosphorus per unit of accumulated carbon. These results demonstrate the importance of interdependent ecological and biogeochemical processes, and the role of soil-plant interactions in determining the success of restoration efforts. In contrast with previous but unsuccessful attempts to restore mined areas through nutrient application alone, iron-mediated stabilization of vegetation inputs favored the regeneration of a barren stable state that had persisted for over five decades since disturbance. The effectiveness of coupled organic matter and iron fertilization, combined with management of invasive species, has the possibility to enhance terrestrial carbon sequestration and accelerate the restoration of degraded lands, while addressing important challenges associated with urban waste disposal.",0,2015,25,5,1226,1234"Hiltunen, T; Ayan, GB; Becks, L",Environmental fluctuations restrict eco-evolutionary dynamics in predator - prey system,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,Article,"Environmental fluctuations, species interactions and rapid evolution are all predicted to affect community structure and their temporal dynamics. Although the effects of the abiotic environment and prey evolution on ecological community dynamics have been studied separately, these factors can also have interactive effects. Here we used bacteria ciliate microcosm experiments to test for eco-evolutionary dynamics in fluctuating environments. Specifically, we followed population dynamics and a prey defence trait over time when populations were exposed to regular changes of bottom-up or top-down stressors, or combinations of these. We found that the rate of evolution of a defence trait was significantly lower in fluctuating compared with stable environments, and that the defence trait evolved to lower levels when two environmental stressors changed recurrently. The latter suggests that top-down and bottom-up changes can have additive effects constraining evolutionary response within populations. The differences in evolutionary trajectories are explained by fluctuations in population sizes of the prey and the predator, which continuously alter the supply of mutations in the prey and strength of selection through predation. Thus, it may be necessary to adopt an eco-evolutionary perspective on studies concerning the evolution of traits mediating species interactions.",0,2015,282,1808,,"Carlson, HK; Kuehl, JV; Hazra, AB; Justice, NB; Stoeva, MK; Sczesnak, A; Mullan, MR; Iavarone, AT; Engelbrektson, A; Price, MN; Deutschbauer, AM; Arkin, AP; Coates, JD",Mechanisms of direct inhibition of the respiratory sulfate-reduction pathway by (per) chlorate and nitrate,ISME JOURNAL,Article,"We investigated perchlorate (ClO4-) and chlorate (ClO3-) (collectively (per) chlorate) in comparison with nitrate as potential inhibitors of sulfide (H2S) production by mesophilic sulfate-reducing microorganisms (SRMs). We demonstrate the specificity and potency of (per) chlorate as direct SRM inhibitors in both pure cultures and undefined sulfidogenic communities. We demonstrate that (per) chlorate and nitrate are antagonistic inhibitors and resistance is cross-inducible implying that these compounds share at least one common mechanism of resistance. Using tagged-transposon pools we identified genes responsible for sensitivity and resistance in Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20. We found that mutants in Dde_2702 (Rex), a repressor of the central sulfate-reduction pathway were resistant to both (per) chlorate and nitrate. In general, Rex derepresses its regulon in response to increasing intracellular NADH: NAD_ratios. In cells in which respiratory sulfate reduction is inhibited, NADH: NAD_ratios should increase leading to derepression of the sulfate-reduction pathway. In support of this, in (per) chlorate or nitrate-stressed wild-type G20 we observed higher NADH: NAD_ratios, increased transcripts and increased peptide counts for genes in the core Rex regulon. We conclude that one mode of (per) chlorate and nitrate toxicity is as direct inhibitors of the central sulfate-reduction pathway. Our results demonstrate that (per) chlorate are more potent inhibitors than nitrate in both pure cultures and communities, implying that they represent an attractive alternative for controlling sulfidogenesis in industrial ecosystems.

MethodWe modelled the response of European vegetation to changes in land use, climate and CO2 by combining the land-use model Dyna-CLUE (based on the CORINE land-cover data) and the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS. Two reforestation options were explored: maintaining the current range of tree species (EFI) or promoting naturally occurring tree species (NAT). Climate data from two general circulation models and two SRES scenarios (A2 and B1) were used. The broad habitat types were classified according to a combination of land use and the dominant plant species. ResultsOur models predicted that croplands and grasslands are expected to decrease due to land-use change. Although climate change has a negative effect on needle-leaved forest, it is expected to maintain its area or even increase in the EFI reforestation option while mediterranean, broad-leaved and mixed forests are expected to increase markedly. All investigated drivers have shown some effect, but land use is the dominant contributor to broad habitat change except for needle-leaved and mixed which are mainly influenced by climate change.

Early life stages of marine organisms are potentially vulnerable to the stressors associated with global change, but identifying general patterns across studies, species and response variables is challenging. This review represents the first meta-analysis of multistressor studies to target early marine life stages (embryo to larvae), particularly between temperature, salinity and pH as these are the best studied. Knowledge gaps in research on multiple abiotic stressors and early life stages are also identified. The meta-analysis yielded several key results: (1) Synergistic interactions (65% of individual tests) are more common than additive (17%) or antagonistic (17%) interactions. (2) Larvae are generally more vulnerable than embryos to thermal and pH stress. (3) Survival is more likely than sublethal responses to be affected by thermal, salinity and pH stress. (4) Interaction types vary among stressors, ontogenetic stages and biological responses, but they are more consistent among phyla. (5) Ocean acidification is a greater stressor for calcifying than noncalcifying larvae. Despite being more ecologically realistic than single-factor studies, multifactorial studies may still oversimplify complex systems, and so meta-analyses of the data from them must be cautiously interpreted with regard to extrapolation to field conditions. Nonetheless, our results identify taxa with early life stages that may be particularly vulnerable (e.g. molluscs, echinoderms) or robust (e.g. arthropods, cnidarians) to abiotic stress.

The extreme dry and hot summer 2003 significantly decreased discharge, increased water temperature and affected water chemistry of the investigated springs. Ecological resilience and elasticity against the climatic extreme event differed significantly between communities dependent on their previous impact by acidification. Springs which were less affected by acidification performed higher resilience and elasticity than strongly acidified springs.

However, the effects of interactions between bark beetle outbreaks and subsequent wildfires on forest succession remain poorly understood. We collected data in dry mixed conifer forests across Idaho and western Montana to test whether vegetation responses differ between sites experiencing single and repeated disturbances. We compared tree seedling density and age, surface fuel loading, and stand structure characteristics in stands that experienced either high severity wildfire, large-scale tree mortality from bark beetles, or stands that experienced high bark beetle mortality followed by severe wildfire within 3-8 years of attack. Tree seedling density was 300-400% higher in gray bark beetle-affected stands than burned sites, but there was no evidence that a beetle and wildfire interaction affected seedling densities. The age distribution of Douglas-fir and grand fir seedlings in stands with repeated disturbances differed from those that only experienced wildfire, suggesting that seed availability varies between these stands. Though both bark beetle outbreaks and wildfires resulted in the death of numerous large trees and surface woody fuel loads 100-200% greater than control sites, the creation of large snags and higher fuel loads across the landscape may have ecological benefits. Compounding effects of bark beetle activity and wildfires were not observed in surface fuel loadings or stand densities. Overall, the effects of high severity wildfire drove post-disturbance fuel complexes and succession whereas the effects of Dendroctonus pseudotsugae and Dendroctonus brevicomis outbreaks before wildfires resulted in minimal post-wildfire differences.

Spinner dolphins display a predictable diurnal behavioural pattern where they forage offshore at night and return to sheltered bays during daytime to rest. These bays, which are also subject to considerable use by humans, have long been recognized as key habitats for this species although the extent to which dolphins rely on specific characteristics of these habitats for rest has not been quantified. An integration of boat-based and land-based group focal follow sampling regimes and three gradient boosting generalized additive models were developed to identify habitat features that contribute to the occurrence of resting spinner dolphins in coastal waters off Hawai'i Island. Two in-bay' models used data collected within bays, and a third coastal' model (near-shore, outside of bays) used data collected both inside and outside of bays. The coastal model identified that spinner dolphins were unlikely to rest outside sheltered bays. In-bay models showed that dolphins rested throughout daylight hours within bays with a peak resting period between 10.00h to 14.00h. The models also identified bottom-substrate-type as an important predictor of rest. Pseudo R-2 values of 061 and 070 for the in-bay models and 066 for the coastal model showed that these models provided a good fit to the behavioural data for the occurrence of resting spinner dolphins.Synthesis and application.

With increasing shifts in hydrographic conditions during the past few decades, a focal task is to understand how environmental drivers affect zoobenthic communities, which play a crucial role in ecosystem functioning. By using long-term data, spanning 40 yr (1973 to 2013) in the northern Baltic Sea, we showed a disparity in zoobenthic responses with pronounced changes in community composition and a trend towards decreased biomass in sheltered areas, while biomasses increased in exposed areas of the coastal zone. We used generalized additive modeling to show that bottom oxygen saturation, sea surface temperature and organic load of the sediments were the main environmental drivers behind contrasting patterns in biomass progression. Oxygen saturation alone explained over one third of the deviation in the biomass developments in sheltered areas, while exposed areas were mainly limited by organic content of the sediments. We analyzed high-resolution climate-scenario simulations, following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios for the Baltic Sea region in combination with different nutrient load scenarios, for the end of the 21st century.

We disentangle the relative effects of genes and environment and test for sex-specific patterns of inheritance. There was strong and significant resemblance among offspring sharing the same nest and offspring of the same cohort. Furthermore, although offspring resemble their mother, and there is some indication for an effect of inbreeding, additive genetic variance and heritability are close to zero. We find no evidence for a role of either maternal imprinting or Z-linked inheritance in generating these patterns, suggesting they are due to non-genetic maternal and common environment effects instead. We conclude that in this wild bird population, environmental factors are the main drivers of variation in early-life RTL, which will severely bias estimates of heritability when not modelled explicitly.",0,2015,282,1807,,"Herzberger, AJ; Meiners, SJ; Towey, JB; Butts, PA; Armstrong, DL",Plant-microbe interactions change along a tallgrass prairie restoration chronosequence,RESTORATION ECOLOGY,Article,"Soil microbial communities are critical in determining the performance and density of species in plant communities. However, their role in regulating the success of restorations is much less clear. This study assessed the ability of soil microbial communities to regulate the growth and performance of two potentially dominant grasses and two common forbs in tallgrass prairie restorations. Specifically, we examined the effects of soil microbial communities along a restoration chronosequence from agricultural fields to remnant prairies using experimentally inoculated soils. The two grass species, Andropogon gerardii and Sorghastrum nutans, grew best with the agricultural inoculates and experienced a decline in performance in later stages of the chronosequence, indicating that the microbial community shifted from being beneficial to grasses in the early stages to inhibiting grasses in the later stages of restoration. Growth of the forb, Silphium terebinthinaceum, varied little with inoculation or position along the restoration chronosequence. Growth of Baptisia leucantha, a legume, appeared limited by nodule formation in agricultural soils, peaked in young restoration soils along with nodule formation, but decreased in older soils as the microbial community became more antagonistic. Overall, negative feedbacks tended to be less important early in restoration, but appeared important in remnant and older restored prairies.

Agriculture affects streams and rivers worldwide, including via nutrient enrichment and increased fine sediment input. We manipulated nutrients (simulating agricultural run-off) and deposited fine sediment (simulating agricultural erosion) (two levels each) and water temperature (eight levels, 0-6 degrees C above ambient) simultaneously in 128 streamside mesocosms to determine the individual and combined effects of the three stressors on macroinvertebrate community dynamics (community composition and body size structure of benthic, drift and insect emergence assemblages). All three stressors had pervasive individual effects, but in combination often produced additive or antagonistic outcomes. Changes in benthic community composition showed a complex interplay among habitat quality (with or without sediment), resource availability (with or without nutrient enrichment) and the behavioural/physiological tendency to drift or emerge as temperature rose. The presence of sediment and raised temperature both resulted in a community of smaller organisms. Deposited fine sediment strongly increased the propensity to drift. Stressor effects were most prominent in the benthic assemblage, frequently reflected by opposite patterns in individuals quitting the benthos (in terms of their propensity to drift or emerge). Of particular importance is that community measures of stream health routinely used around the world (taxon richness, EPT richness and diversity) all showed complex three-way interactions, with either a consistently stronger temperature response or a reversal of its direction when one or both agricultural stressors were also in operation. The negative effects of added fine sediment, which were often stronger at raised temperatures, suggest that streams already impacted by high sediment loads may be further degraded under a warming climate.

However, recent concerns have appeared about their efficiency to promote pollinator diversity. To increase the efficiency of these interventions, one must acquire a better knowledge of the target species diversity patterns and its sources of variations at different spatial and temporal scales. This study sets out to identify the main sources of variation in wild bee assemblages at a regional scale (450 km(2)) in mass-flowering crops and semi-natural habitats. During three consecutive sampling years, we monitored bee diversity and its temporal and spatial turnovers. We show that an intensive agricultural landscape in western France can hold nearly 200 wild bee species at a regional scale, i.e. 20 % of the whole bee fauna known in mainland France. Wild bee diversity was 3-4 times lower in oleaginous crops than in semi-natural habitats, with a substantial number of these being social and gregarious species. Spatial and seasonal species turnover in semi-natural habitats explained 28.6 and 34.3 %, respectively, of regional species richness. Given the importance of the spatial component of the bee diversity turnover, we suggest wild bee conservation efforts should be carried out at relevant spatial scales. The spatial turnover was estimated to be steeper within 50 km(2) scales.

Exploitation barriers and the antagonist nature of mutualisms,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY,Article,"The romantic perception of plant-animal mutualisms as a cooperative endeavour has been shattered in the last decades. While the classic theory of plant-pollinator coevolution assumed that partner coevolution is largely mutualistic, an increasing appreciation of the inherent conflict of interests between such partners has led to the realization that genes that confer a reproductive advantage to plants may have negative effects on their pollinators (and vice versa), giving rise to an apparent paradox: that antagonistic processes may drive coevolution among mutualistic partners. Under this new paradigm, mutualistic partners are bound by mutual interest but shaped by ""selfish"" antagonistic processes. Exploitation barriers mediated by resource competition among pollinators are a key element of this paradigm. Exploitation barriers involve traits such as tubular corollas, red flowers, toxic or deterrent rewards, and attractants of floral predators. Exploitation barriers result in resource partitioning, increasing floral fidelity of favoured pollinators and therefore plant fitness; but they often entail a physiological, behavioural or developmental cost for such favoured pollinators. Resource partitioning mediated by exploitation barriers is a very powerful driver of floral diversification, robust to variation in pollinator assemblages; hence, it may contribute to elucidating the occurrence of co-evolutionary changes in multi-species contexts. Exploitation barriers provide also a mechanistic basis for trait-based modelling of interaction networks, and represent a reason for caution in assuming fixed interaction identity or strength when modelling such networks (e.g. in rarefaction procedures used to estimate secondary extinctions). We propose to replace the misleading metaphor that depicts flowers and pollinators as cooperative partners by a metaphor in which plants and pollinator are traders, seeking to obtain different services from each other in complete disregard for the benefit of their mutualistic partner.",0,2015,29,3,311,322"Carlisle, AB; Litvin, SY; Hazen, EL; Madigan, DJ; Goldman, KJ; Lea, RN; Block, BA",Reconstructing habitat use by juvenile salmon sharks links upwelling to strandings in the California Current,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,Article,"The use of nursery areas by elasmobranchs is an important life history strategy that is thought to reduce juvenile mortality and increase population growth rates. The endothermic salmon shark Lamna ditropis uses the California Current System (CCS) as a nursery area, though little is known about how juveniles use this ecosystem. Juvenile salmon sharks consistently strand along the west coast of North America. Strandings in the southern CCS occurred throughout the year, while those in the northern CCS were limited to summer and autumn, when mean sea surface temperatures were warmest. Strandings primarily occurred when water temperature was between 12 and 16 degrees C, suggesting that juveniles occupy a relatively narrow thermal niche. Stable isotope analysis (SIA) indicated that juveniles primarily feed on offshore meso-and epipelagic prey from the outer shelf, slope, and oceanic habitats as opposed to inshore and coastal habitats, although sharks appeared to move closer to shore prior to stranding. Generalized additive models indicate that the probability of stranding was greatest when mean water temperatures were relatively high (similar to 14 degrees C) and sharks were exposed to acute cold-water events (similar to 9 degrees C) during coastal upwelling. This suggests that juveniles are thermally limited and stressed by upwelling events, resulting in bacterial infections that are the proximate cause of the strandings.",0,2015,525,,217,228"Buma, B","Disturbance interactions: characterization, prediction, and the potential for cascading effects",ECOSPHERE,Article,"Disturbances are fundamental components of ecosystems and, in many cases, a dominant driver of ecosystem structure and function at multiple spatial and temporal scales. While the effect of any one disturbance may be relatively well understood, multiple interacting disturbances can cause unexpected disturbance behavior (e.g., larger extents), altered return likelihoods, or reduced ecosystem resilience and regime shifts. Given the long-lasting implications of such events, and the potential for changes in disturbance rates driven by climate change and increasing anthropogenic pressures, developing a broad conceptual understanding and some predictive ability regarding the likelihood of interactions between disturbances is crucial. Through a broad synthesis of the literature, and across multiple biomes, disturbance interactions are placed into a unified framework around the concept of changing ecosystem resistance (""linked interactions,"" alterations to likelihood, extent, or severity) or ecosystem resilience (""compound interactions,"" alterations to recovery time or trajectory). Understanding and predicting disturbance interactions requires disaggregating disturbances into their constituent legacies, identifying the mechanisms which drive disturbances behavior (or ecosystem recovery), and determining when and where those mechanisms might be altered by the legacies of prior disturbances. The potential for cascading effects is discussed, by which these interactions may extend the reach of anthropogenic or climate change-induced alterations to disturbances beyond what is currently anticipated. Finally, several avenues for future research are outlined, as suggested from the current literature (and areas in which that literature is lacking). These include the potential for cross-scale interactions and changing scale-driven limitations, further work on cascading effects, and the potential for cross-biome comparisons. Disturbance interactions have the potential to cause large, nonlinear, or unexpected changes in ecosystem structure and functioning; finding generality across these complex events is an important step in predicting their occurrence and understanding their significance.",0,2015,6,4,,"Ferreira, FS; Tabosa, AB; Gomes, RB; Martins, FR; Matias, LQ",Spatiotemporal ecological drivers of an aquatic plant community in a temporary tropical pool,JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS,Article,"Ecological processes that extend over time and space organize plant communities, producing different spatiotemporal patterns of species aggregation (or non-aggregation). To investigate whether the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of the species are generated by interspecific competition and/or environmental filtering, we investigated the organization of an aquatic plant community in a temporary pool in the semiarid region of NE Brazil. For seven months (during the rainy season), we sampled aquatic plants along transects in the pool and measured limnological parameters. The spatial structure of the community changed significantly over time. The input and permanence of species in the community varied according to the stage of flooding of the pool. This leads to the expectation that the species would have overlapping niches, causing interspecific competition to increase and exclude less efficient competitors. Indeed, we found that the species coexisting in the pool were only slightly phylogenetically related, an evidence of interspecific competition. Therefore, in the temporary pool, the spatiotemporal organization of the aquatic plant community appears to be driven by simultaneous action of ecological abiotic and biotic processes that operate in an antagonistic fashion.

Changes in UK black grouse Tetrao tetrix populations are thought to have been strongly influenced by upland land use change. In a long-studied population within Perthshire, lek persistence is positively correlated with lek size, and remaining leks clustered most strongly within the landscape when the population is lowest, suggesting that there may be a demographic and/or spatial context to the reaction of the population to habitat changes. Hierarchical cluster analysis of lek locations revealed that patterns of lek occupancy when the population was declining were different to those during the later recovery period. Response curves from lek-habitat models developed using MaxEnt for periods with a declining population, low population, and recovering population were consistent across years for most habitat measures. We found evidence linking lek persistence with habitat quality changes and more leks which appeared between 1994 and 2008 were in improving habitat than those which disappeared during the same period. Generalised additive models identified changes in woodland and starting lek size as being important indicators of lek survival between declining and low/recovery periods. There may also have been a role for local densities in explaining recovery since the population low point.

Although studies of single concentrations of nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P) have shown effects at relatively low concentrations, responses of litter breakdown rates along gradients of low-to-moderate N and P concentrations are needed to establish likely interdependent effects of dual N and P enrichment on baseline activity in stream ecosystems. We established 25 combinations of dissolved inorganic N (DIN; 55-545 mu g/L) and soluble reactive P (SRP; 4-86 mu g/L) concentrations with corresponding N: P molar ratios of 2-127 in experimental stream channels. We excluded macroinvertebrates, focusing on microbially driven breakdown of maple (Acer rubrum L.) and rhododendron (Rhododendron maximum L.) leaf litter. Breakdown rates, k, per day (d(-1)) and per degree-day (dd(-1)), increased by up to 63for maple and 12xfor rhododendron over our N and P enrichment gradient compared to rates at low ambient N and P concentrations. The best models of k (d(-1) and dd(-1)) included litter species identity and N and P concentrations; there was evidence for both additive and interactive effects of N and P. Models explaining variation in k dd(-1) were supported by N and P for both maple and rhododendron (R-adj(2) = 0.67 and 0.33, respectively). Residuals in the relationship between k dd(-1) and N concentration were largely explained by P, but residuals for k dd(-1) and P concentration were less adequately explained by N. Breakdown rates were more closely related to nutrient concentrations than variables associated with measurements of two mechanistic parameters associated with C loss (fungal biomass and microbial respiration rate). We also determined the effects of nutrient addition on litter C: nutrient stoichiometry and found reductions in litter C:N and C:P along our experimental nutrient gradient.

Under low relatedness, cheaters can evolve that benefit from the altruistic behaviour of others without themselves sacrificing. If these are obligate cheaters, incapable of cooperating, their spread can lead to the demise of multicellularity. One possibility, however, is that cooperators can evolve resistance to cheaters. We tested this idea in a facultatively multicellular social amoeba, Dictyostelium discoideum. This amoeba usually exists as a single cell but, when stressed, thousands of cells aggregate to form a multicellular organism in which some of the cells sacrifice for the good of others. We used lineages that had undergone experimental evolution at very low relatedness, during which time obligate cheaters evolved. Unlike earlier experiments, which found resistance to cheaters that were prevented from evolving, we competed cheaters and noncheaters that evolved together, and cheaters with their ancestors. We found that noncheaters can evolve resistance to cheating before cheating sweeps through the population and multicellularity is lost.

The identification of synergism or antagonism is generally straightforward when stressors operate in the same direction, but if individual stressor effects oppose each other, the definition of synergism is paradoxical because what is synergistic to one stressor's effect direction is antagonistic to the others. In their highly cited meta-analysis, Crain et al. (Ecology Letters, 11, 2008: 1304) assumed insituations with opposing individual effects that synergy only occurs when the cumulative effect is more negative than the additive sum of the opposing individual effects. We argue against this and propose a new systematic classification based on an additive effects model that combines the magnitude and response direction of the cumulative effect and the interaction effect. A new class of mitigating synergism is identified, where cumulative effects are reversed and enhanced. We applied our directional classification to the dataset compiled by Crain etal. (Ecology Letters, 11, 2008: 1304) to determine the prevalence of synergistic, antagonistic, and additive interactions. Compared to their original analysis, we report differences in the representation of interaction classes by interaction type and we document examples of mitigating synergism, highlighting the importance of incorporating individual stressor effect directions in the determination of synergisms and antagonisms. This is particularly pertinent given a general bias in ecology toward investigating and reporting adverse multiple stressor effects (double negative).

However, the relationship between the community responses of soil microbes and variation in tree mixtures vs functional composition remains poorly understood. We investigated soil biochemical properties and soil microbial resistance and resilience to drought in three 4-year-old tree monocultures (Acer saccharum Marsh, Larix laricina (Duroi) K. Koch and Pinus strobus L.) and two tree species combinations (L.laricina/A.saccharum and L.laricina/P.strobus) planted in a high-density tree field experiment located in southern Quebec, Canada. The experimentally imposed drought stress consisted of maintaining soil material for 30days at 25% of water-holding capacity (WHC). Microbial biomass was assessed immediately after the water stress (resistance) and 15 and 30days following drought (resilience). Results showed that tree communities influenced soil chemistry, soil respirometry properties and microbial resistance and resilience. We measured significant non-additive (i.e. both synergistic and antagonistic) effects of mixing tree species in some of the soil biochemical properties measured, mostly in the L.laricina/A.saccharum mixture. However, we did not find non-additive effects of tree mixtures on microbial resistance and resilience. A structural equation modelling analysis revealed that resistance and resilience were mostly modulated by direct effects of community-weighted means (CWM) of leaf litter lignin content and mineralizable N, and by indirect links from tree density and CWM of leaf litter N content via mineralizable N. This study suggests that tree species identity surpassed species mixtures as a key driver of soil microbial resistance and resilience.

MethodsWe studied three species of Australian Acacia with different invasion success in New Zealand. In both Australia and New Zealand, we measured pollination success as the number of pods per inflorescence and the proportion of aborted seeds per pod, determined losses to pre-dispersal seed predators, and measured overall seed output. For each species, we compared performance in New Zealand with that in Australia, then examined whether there was any variation among species in their relative performance in each country. ResultsThe number of pods per inflorescence and proportion of seeds aborted were similar in each country and among species. There was little difference in pre-dispersal seed predation rate between Australia and New Zealand for Acacia dealbata, an invasive species, and Acacia baileyana, a species widely naturalized in New Zealand.

Both the invasive A. dealbata and the casual A. pravissima produced more seeds per tree in New Zealand than Australia. Main conclusionsDifferences in reproductive success between the native and introduced range could not explain the differences in invasion success among the three Acacia species. Although per capita reproductive output was higher in New Zealand for two species, neither mutualistic interactions with pollinators nor antagonistic interactions with pre-dispersal seed predators explained those differences.

Grazing intensity on S. latissima also increased non-linearly with decreasing standing kelp biomass across 5 sites spanning 40 km (linear distance) of coast and 2 yr, but we did not find strong support for this relationship for the kelp Laminaria digitata. Intensification of grazing augments the indirect effect of L. vincta on S. latissima (increased blade erosion and fragmentation), and drives it beyond a threshold for further losses of kelp biomass with subsequent storms. This positive feedback between large-scale disturbances and local-scale grazing could reinforce the depletion of kelp and facilitate the establishment of turf-forming algae on Nova Scotian rocky reefs.

Because host-parasite interactions are so ubiquitous, it is of primary interest for ecologists to understand the factors that generate, maintain and constrain these associations. Phylogenetic comparative studies have found abundant evidence for host-switching to relatively unrelated hosts, sometimes related to diversification events, in a variety of host-parasite systems. For Monogenoidea (Platyhelminthes) parasites, it has been suggested that the co-speciation model alone cannot explain host occurrences, hence host-switching and/or non-vicariant modes of speciation should be associated with the origins and diversification of several monogenoid taxa. The factors that shape broad patterns of parasite sharing were investigated using path analysis as a way to generate hypotheses about the origins of host-parasite interactions between monogenoid gill parasites and Neotropical freshwater fishes. Parasite sharing was assessed from an interaction matrix, and explanatory variables included phylogenetic relationships, environmental preferences, biological traits and geographic distribution for each host species. Although geographic distribution of hosts and host ecology are important factors to understand host-parasite interactions, especially within host lineages that share a relatively recent evolutionary history, phylogeny had the strongest overall direct effect on parasite sharing. Phylogenetic contiguity of host communities may allow a stepping-stone' mode of host-switching, which increases parasite sharing.

We found that for 48weeks, before acclimation occurred, an experimental 3 degrees C increase in sward temperature gave rise to a 50% increase in below ground respiration (ca. 0.4kg Cm-2; Q(10)=3.5), whereas mineralisation of older SOC without plants increased with a Q(10) of only 1.7 when subject to increases in ambient soil temperature. Subsequent C-14 dating of respired CO2 indicated that the presence of plants in swards more than doubled the effect of warming on the rate of mineralisation of SOC with an estimated mean C age of ca. 8years or older relative to incubated soils without recent plant inputs. These results not only illustrate the formidable complexity of mechanisms controlling C fluxes in soils but also suggest that the dual biological and physical effects of CO2 on primary productivity and global temperature have the potential to synergistically increase the mineralisation of existing soil C.",0,2015,21,3,1368,1375"Khamis, K; Brown, LE; Hannah, DM; Milner, AM",Experimental evidence that predator range expansion modifies alpine stream community structure,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,Article,"Climate change is projected to facilitate altitudinal range expansions of lowland' taxa, creating novel species interactions. However, how range shifts will alter biotic interactions and community structure in alpine streams is not well understood. In the Pyrenees, climate-induced physicochemical habitat change is hypothesized to facilitate the colonization of high-altitude streams by Perla grandis, a carnivorous stonefly. A field-based experiment was conducted in mesocosm channels beside a hillslope spring (2000 m asl) in the Taillon-Gabietous catchment, French Pyrenees. The influence of P. grandis predation on community structure, feeding trait composition, body-size spectrum, and algal chlorophyll a concentration was examined. Gut contents were analyzed and used to identify consumed prey. Total invertebrate density was not significantly reduced by P. grandis, but Baetis spp. densities were depressed in the treatment channels through a combination of direct consumption and predator avoidance (emigration/drift). However, despite fewer grazers in the predator treatment channels, the magnitude of the trophic cascade effect on basal resources (measured as chlorophyll a density) was comparable between treatment and control channels. The results of this experiment suggest that size/species-specific predation, intraguild predation, and interference competition are the likely mechanisms that altered the body-size spectrum in treatment channels. In synergy with climate-driven physicochemical habitat change, the extinction risk of some range-restricted taxa (prey and other predators) could be increased where P. grandis colonization occurs. Hence, conservation efforts are required to ensure that additional anthropogenic stressors (e.g., nutrient enrichment, cattle trampling, hydropower development, ski runs, and tourism) are limited to minimize further pressures on these unique and sensitive habitats.",0,2015,34,1,66,80"Kristensen, TN; Overgaard, J; Lassen, J; Hoffmann, AA; Sgro, C",Low evolutionary potential for egg-to-adult viability in Drosophila melanogaster at high temperatures,EVOLUTION,Article,"To cope with the increasing and less-predictable temperature forecasts under climate change, many terrestrial ectotherms will have to migrate or rely on adaptation through plastic or evolutionary means. Studies suggest that some ectotherms have a limited potential to change their upper thermal limits via evolutionary shifts, but research has mostly focused on adult life stages under laboratory conditions. Here we use replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster and a nested half-sib/full-sib quantitative genetic design to estimate heritabilities and genetic variance components for egg-to-adult viability under both laboratory and seminatural field conditions, encompassing cold, benign, and hot temperatures in two separate populations. The results demonstrated temperature-specific heritabilities and additive genetic variances for egg-to-adult viability. Heritabilities and genetic variances were higher under cold and benign compared to hot temperatures when tested under controlled laboratory conditions. Tendencies toward lower evolutionary potential at higher temperatures were also observed under seminatural conditions although the results were less clear in the field setting. Overall the results suggest that ectotherms that already experience temperatures close to their upper thermal tolerance limits have a restricted capacity to adapt to higher temperatures by evolutionary means.",0,2015,69,3,803,814"Zhang, M; Xu, J; Hansson, LA",Local environment overrides regional climate influence on regime shift in a north temperate lake,AQUATIC ECOLOGY,Article,"Regime shifts in shallow lakes are typically characterized by submerged macrophyte (clear water regime) or phytoplankton (turbid regime) dominance. Climate warming is expected to affect water quality and facilitate turbidity in lakes, but we may also expect synergistic effects on organisms' interactions from climate and local specific dynamics in lakes. We here examined long-term changes in phytoplankton composition in July and August from 1980 to 2011 in a temperate shallow lake, Lake Krankesjon, a dataset including 21 years throughout a 31-year period. We hypothesize that although effects of the ongoing climate change are visible in our long-term data set, local specific dynamics override climate effects. We found that cyanophytes were the most abundant phytoplankton taxa among which small-sized colonial cyanobacteria were dominant. Both population density of small-sized colonial cyanobacteria and maximum water temperature increased over the period of study. However, the variations in the phytoplankton assembly were likely mainly related to three principal factors, including the local availability of nutrients, grazing from zooplankton, and possibly, an increasing trend in temperature. The first two factors are associated with the local specific dynamics, while the last with regional climate. Our long-term study showed that although there were potential climate warming effects on the phytoplankton community, local factors, such as biotic interactions and nutrient availability, were likely stronger drivers than climate warming in Lake Krankesjon at least over the last 30-year period.",0,2015,49,1,105,113"Cornwall, CE; Eddy, TD","Effects of near-future ocean acidification, fishing, and marine protection on a temperate coastal ecosystem",CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,Article,"Understanding ecosystem responses to global and local anthropogenic impacts is paramount to predicting future ecosystem states. We used an ecosystem modeling approach to investigate the independent and cumulative effects of fishing, marine protection, and ocean acidification on a coastal ecosystem. To quantify the effects of ocean acidification at the ecosystem level, we used information from the peer-reviewed literature on the effects of ocean acidification. Using an Ecopath with Ecosim ecosystem model for the Wellington south coast, including the Taputeranga Marine Reserve (MR), New Zealand, we predicted ecosystem responses under 4 scenarios: ocean acidification + fishing; ocean acidification + MR (no fishing); no ocean acidification + fishing; no ocean acidification + MR for the year 2050. Fishing had a larger effect on trophic group biomasses and trophic structure than ocean acidification, whereas the effects of ocean acidification were only large in the absence of fishing. Mortality by fishing had large, negative effects on trophic group biomasses. These effects were similar regardless of the presence of ocean acidification. Ocean acidification was predicted to indirectly benefit certain species in the MR scenario. This was because lobster (Jasus edwardsii) only recovered to 58% of the MR biomass in the ocean acidification + MR scenario, a situation that benefited the trophic groups lobsters prey on. Most trophic groups responded antagonistically to the interactive effects of ocean acidification and marine protection (46%; reduced response); however, many groups responded synergistically (33%; amplified response). Conservation and fisheries management strategies need to account for the reduced recovery potential of some exploited species under ocean acidification, nonadditive interactions of multiple factors, and indirect responses of species to ocean acidification caused by declines in calcareous predators. Efectos Futuros de la Acidificacion Oceanica, la Pesca y la Proteccion Marina sobre un Ecosistema Costero Templado Entender las respuestas ambientales a los impactos antropogenicos globales y locales es primordial para predecir los estados futuros de los ecosistemas. Usamos una estrategia de modelado de ecosistemas para investigar los efectos independientes y acumulativos de la pesca, la proteccion marina y la acidificacion oceanica sobre un ecosistema costero. Para cuantificar los efectos de la acidificacion oceanica en el nivel de ecosistema, usamos informacion de la literatura revisada por colegas sobre los efectos de la acidificacion oceanica. Al usar un modelo de ecosistema Ecopath con Ecosim para la costa sur de Wellington, incluyendo la Reserva Marina Taputeranga (RM), Nueva Zelanda, pronosticamos las respuestas ambientales bajo cuatro escenarios: acidificacion oceanica + pesca; acidificacion oceanica + reservas marinas (RM) (sin pesca); ninguna acidificacion oceanica + pesca; ninguna acidificacion oceanica + RM para el ano 2050. La pesca tuvo un mayor efecto sobre la biomasa de los grupos troficos y sobre la estructura trofica que la acidificacion oceanica, mientras que los efectos de la acidificacion oceanica solo fueron mayores en la ausencia de la pesca. La mortandad por pesca tuvo efectos negativos mayores sobre la biomasa de los grupos troficos. Estos efectos fueron similares sin importar la presencia de la acidificacion oceanica. Se pronostico que la acidificacion oceanica beneficiaria indirectamente a ciertas especies en el escenario RM. Esto se debio a que la langosta (Jasus edwardsii) solo recuperaba hasta el 58% de la biomasa de la RM en el escenario de acidificacion oceanica + RM, una situacion que beneficio a los grupos troficos de los cuales se alimenta la langosta. La mayoria de los grupos troficos respondieron de manera antagonica a los efectos interactivos de la acidificacion oceanica y las reservas marinas (46% redujo su respuesta); sin embargo, muchos grupos respondieron de manera sinergica (33% amplio su respuesta).

However, this hypothesis has received little support in cold-limited and subalpine forests where positive growth responses to either rising c(a) or warmer temperatures are still under debate. In this study, we address this issue by analyzing an extensive dendrochronological network of high-elevation Pinus uncinata forests in Spain (28 sites, 544 trees) encompassing the whole biogeographical extent of the species. We determine if the basal area increment (BAI) trends are linked to climate warming and increased c(a) by focusing on region- and age-dependent responses. The largest improvement in BAI over the past six centuries occurred during the last 150years affecting young trees and being driven by recent warming. Indeed, most studied regions and age classes presented BAI patterns mainly controlled by temperature trends, while growing-season precipitation was only relevant in the driest sites. Growth enhancement was linked to rising c(a) in mature (151-300year-old trees) and old-mature trees (301-450year-old trees) from the wettest sites only. This finding implies that any potential fertilization effect of elevated c(a) on forest growth is contingent on tree features that vary with ontogeny and it depends on site conditions (for instance water availability). Furthermore, we found widespread growth decline in drought-prone sites probably indicating that the rise in c(a) did not compensate for the reduction in water availability. Thus, warming-triggered drought stress may become a more important direct driver of growth than rising c(a) in similar subalpine forests. We argue that broad approaches in biogeographical and temporal terms are required to adequately evaluate any effect of rising c(a) on forest growth.",0,2015,21,2,738,749"Ortego, J; Gugger, PF; Sork, VL",Climatically stable landscapes predict patterns of genetic structure and admixture in the Californian canyon live oak,JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,Article,"Aim We studied which factors shape contemporary patterns of genetic structure, diversity and admixture in the canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis). Specifically, we tested two alternative hypotheses: (1) that areas with high habitat suitability and stability since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) sustain higher effective population sizes, resulting in increased levels of genetic diversity; and (2) that populations from areas with lower habitat stability show higher levels of genetic admixture due to their recurrent colonization by individuals originating from genetically differentiated populations. Furthermore, we analysed the relative importance of past and current habitat suitability and their additive effects on contemporary patterns of genetic structure. Location California, USA. Methods We sampled 160 individuals from 33 localities across the distribution range of the canyon live oak in California and then combined information from 13 nuclear microsatellite DNA markers and climate niche modelling to study patterns of genetic variation in this species. We used Bayesian clustering analyses to analyse geographical patterns of genetic structure and admixture, and circuit theory to generate isolation-by-resistance (IBR) distance matrices. Results We found that the degree of genetic admixture was higher in localities with lower inferred population stability, but that genetic diversity was not associated with habitat suitability or stability. Landscape genetic analyses identified habitat stability as the primary driver of population genetic differentiation. Main conclusions This study shows that habitat stability can be a major factor shaping genetic variation in wind-pollinated trees and supports the idea that stable regions contribute to genetic connectivity across different climatic periods. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report an association between patterns of genetic admixture and stability of local habitat.",0,2015,42,2,328,338"Ricotta, C; Bacaro, G; Caccianiga, M; Cerabolini, BEL; Moretti, M",A classical measure of phylogenetic dissimilarity and its relationship with beta diversity,BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY,Article,"Rao developed the DISC dissimilarity coefficient to summarize the dissimilarity between pairs of plots based on species abundances and interspecies dissimilarities. In this paper, we review the potential of the DISC coefficient for assessing plot-to-plot phylogenetic dissimilarity. First, the relationship between plot-to-plot dissimilarity and additive beta diversity is discussed. Next, we show that additive diversity decomposition can be interpreted in terms of a sum of classical Euclidean distances. Based on this geometrical interpretation of additive diversity decomposition, we then suggest an alternative way for calculating an analog of the DISC coefficient directly from the centroids of two species plots in multivariate phylogenetic space. The key to this method is that the centroids can be easily calculated by applying a principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) to the corresponding species phylogenetic distances. Finally, to show the potential of the DISC coefficient for analyzing the relationship between community structure and ecosystem functioning, we used the proposed measure by comparing phylogenetic and functional changes in plant communities along a primary succession on a glacier foreland in northern Italy. Our results show that changes in Grime's CSR functional classification of plant assemblages as competitors (C), stress-tolerators (S) and ruderals (R) along the successional gradient are also reflected in phylogenetic changes, indicating that species sorting by environmental filtering tends to favor the co-occurrence of phylogenetically related species.

Multivariate modelling techniques, including general linear and additive modelling, ordination and classification trees were used to identify the biotic and abiotic factors that control range edges. Results Rear edges were associated with lower solar radiation and potential evapotranspiration, as would generally be expected as ranges shift in a warming climate regime. Leading edges were associated with lower topographical positions, such as canyon bottoms, and were characterized by recent disturbance and early successional stages.

Managing disturbance regimes and nutrient inputs may help maintain species diversity in such remnants. Yet, it is unclear the extent to which changes in resource availability due to reduced capture by resident plants and/or increased supply rates may trigger native community disassembly and exotic invasions. We examined how mowing disturbance and N fertilizer addition affected plant community recovery after a burning event in a remnant corridor of tussock pampa grassland in Argentina. The percentage cover and richness of native and exotic plant functional groups were monitored over 4years. According to the fluctuating resource theory', we expected invasion to be the highest when both light and N availability were increased simultaneously. Mowing delayed recovery by dominant C-4 tussock grasses and promoted subordinate, native C-3 grasses and exotic legumes, thus enhancing both native and exotic species richness. Fertilization induced a transient increase in native forbs but decreased total plant richness. Moreover, N addition to mowed grassland led to rapid invasion by short-lived exotic forbs, which were then replaced by exotic perennial grasses. Exotic grasses eventually spread across the grassland corridor, although at different rates depending on the treatment, and in parallel to a generalized decline in native species cover.Synthesis and applications. Community disassembly patterns reflected differential responses of native and exotic functional groups to altered resource supply rates. Synergisms between canopy disturbances and N enrichment posed the greatest threat to preserving a pampa grassland remnant prone to invasion.

Species tolerant to extremely harsh abiotic conditions (e.g. low pH or hypoxia) often have relatively small realised niches due to a trade-off between abiotic and biotic stress tolerance, and are therefore particularly vulnerable to extinction. We hypothesised that tolerance to multiple extreme conditions (e.g. low pH, hypoxia and drought) in brown mudfish Neochanna apoda, would increase their realised niche breadth because each extreme would provide additive refuge against a dominant species, the banded kokopu Galaxias fasciatus. Fish distributions were surveyed in 65 peat-swamp-forest streams and pools in New Zealand, which varied in dissolved oxygen, acidity and hydroperiod. Mudfish distribution was extremely patchy, and almost completely allopatric with kokopu. Allopatry was driven mainly by pool hydroperiod; mudfish occupied 88 percent of temporary pools due to their tolerance of habitat drying, whereas kokopu were absent from temporary pools. Within permanent pools, mudfish occurrence was negatively related to pool oxygen and pH, whereas kokopu occurrence was positively related to these conditions. Pool conditions were independently distributed in the landscape, suggesting that each abiotic stressor offered additive refuge for mudfish from kokopu predation/competition. Consequently, the mudfish realised niche breadth depended on the number of abiotic factors driving their allopatry with kokopu. Given the widespread negative relationships between niche breadth and species extinction probabilities, our results indicate that tolerance to multiple stressors may play an important role in insuring species persistence against the multiple drivers of global environmental change.",0,2015,38,2,154,162"Carrillo, P; Medina-Sanchez, JM; Duran, C; Herrera, G; Villafane, VE; Helbling, EW",Synergistic effects of UVR and simulated stratification on commensalistic phytoplankton-bacteria relationship in two optically contrasting oligotrophic Mediterranean lakes,BIOGEOSCIENCES,Article,"An indirect effect of global warming is a reduction in the depth of the upper mixed layer (UML) causing organisms to be exposed to higher levels of ultraviolet (UVR, 280-400 nm) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm). This can affect primary and bacterial production as well as the commensalistic phytoplankton-bacteria relationship. The combined effects of UVR and reduction in the depth of the UML were assessed on variables related to the metabolism of phytoplankton and bacteria, during in situ experiments performed with natural pico- and nanoplankton communities from two oligotrophic lakes with contrasting UVR transparency (high-UVR versus low-UVR waters) of southern Spain. The negative UVR effects on epilimnetic primary production (PP) and on heterotrophic bacterial production (HBP), intensified under increased stratification, were higher in the low-UVR than in the high-UVR lake, and stronger on the phytoplanktonic than on the heterotrophic bacterial communities. Under UVR and increased stratification, the commensalistic phytoplankton-bacteria relationship was strengthened in the high-UVR lake where excretion of organic carbon (EOC) rates exceeded the bacterial carbon demand (BCD; i.e., BCD: EOC(%) ratio < 100). This did not occur in the low-UVR lake (i.e., BCD: EOC(%) ratio > 100). The greater UVR damage to phytoplankton and bacteria and the weakening of their commensalistic interaction found in the low-UVR lake indicates that these ecosystems would be especially vulnerable to UVR and increased stratification as stressors related to global climate change.

I found (1) increased flooding decreased family richness in the closed-canopy forests but increased it in their gaps, with no trends for no. of unique species, (2) flooding decreased stem size everywhere as did the number of stems as size increased especially for larger stems, (3) Green's index showed clumping only for least-flooded forests with the closed-canopy forest showing more than its tree fall gap, and (4) both flooding and tree fall gap creation decreased canopy coverage perhaps as an additive effect. Further among the stem size classes, only the smallest stems were significantly affected by openness and by type of forest, with a significant interaction term where flooding significantly decreased the number of these smaller stems in all forests and their gaps, except those with the highest level of flooding. Also tree fall gaps had significantly more, smaller stems than their forests in the two most-flooded forests, but not in the least-flooded forest.

Historically, mutualisms have been considered to be less important than antagonisms in affecting the composition of ecological communities. In plant communities, beneficial microbes may feature as keystone mutualists in structuring community composition. Understanding the direction and magnitude of mutualist effects at the community scale may be critical for making accurate predictions on plant responses to climate change, particularly for mutualists that ameliorate climate-induced stressors. Such mitigation could shift outcomes between mutualist-enhanced species diversity and mutualist-reduced diversity, depending on whether a mutualist accelerates habitat modification or competitive exclusion by its partner species. 2. Here, we tested the relative importance and interactive effects of altered precipitation and symbiosis between an epichloid fungal endophyte and a dominant grass species for dune plant communities along the Great Lakes, USA. In 2010, we imposed field manipulations of endophyte presence in the foundation dune grass Ammophila breviligulata in combination with rainout shelters and rainfall additions. We monitored natural rates of colonization by new plant individuals over 3 years. 3. Under the current precipitation regime, endophyte symbiosis in A. breviligulata reduced colonizing plant diversity, species richness and evenness. This effect depended on the amount of precipitation, with the symbiosis having weaker effects on plant diversity under both augmented and reduced rainfall treatments. 4. Despite the overall negative effect of endophyte symbiosis on plant diversity, plant responses to the endophyte were species specific. A federally threatened forb, Cirsium pitcheri, increased in abundance when the symbiosis was present, regardless of precipitation regime. Endophyte symbiosis in A. breviligulata caused minor reductions in the abundance of other grass species; however, augmented precipitation benefited other grasses. 5. Synthesis. We show that microbial mutualisms can have strong effects on community structure in a native ecosystem and that the amount of precipitation has the potential to alter how these keystone species interactions affect community composition.

Because resource C : N: P stoichiometry (i.e. the ratios of these key elements) exhibits strong control on consumers, we supposed that stoichiometric dissimilarity of litter mixtures (i.e. the divergence in C : N: P ratios among species) improves resource complementarity to decomposers leading to faster mixture decomposition. We tested this hypothesis with: (i) a wide range of leaf litter mixtures of neotropical tree species varying in C : N: P dissimilarity, and (ii) a nutrient addition experiment (C, N and P) to create stoichiometric similarity. Litter mixtures decomposed in the field using two different types of litterbags allowing or preventing access to soil fauna. Litter mixture mass loss was higher than expected from species decomposing singly, especially in presence of soil fauna. With fauna, synergistic litter mixture effects increased with increasing stoichiometric dissimilarity of litter mixtures and this positive relationship disappeared with fertilizer addition.

Mutations selected in one environment may result in pleiotropic fitness trade-offs in subsequent novel environments, slowing the rates of adaptation. Epistatic interactions between mutations selected in sequential stressful environments may slow or accelerate subsequent rates of adaptation, depending on the nature of that interaction. We explored the dynamics of adaptation during sequential exposure to herbicides with different modes of action in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Evolution of resistance to two of the herbicides was largely independent of selection history. For carbetamide, previous adaptation to other herbicide modes of action positively impacted the likelihood of adaptation to this herbicide. Furthermore, while adaptation to all individual herbicides was associated with pleiotropic fitness costs in stress-free environments, we observed that accumulation of resistance mechanisms was accompanied by a reduction in overall fitness costs. We suggest that antagonistic epistasis may be a driving mechanism that enables populations to more readily adapt in novel environments. These findings highlight the potential for sequences of xenobiotics to facilitate the rapid evolution of multiple-drug and -pesticide resistance, as well as the potential for epistatic interactions between adaptive mutations to facilitate evolutionary rescue in rapidly changing environments.",0,2014,281,1794,,"Ballhorn, DJ; Godschalx, AL; Smart, SM; Kautz, S; Schadler, M",Chemical defense lowers plant competitiveness,OECOLOGIA,Article,"Both plant competition and plant defense affect biodiversity and food web dynamics and are central themes in ecology research. The evolutionary pressures determining plant allocation toward defense or competition are not well understood. According to the growth-differentiation balance hypothesis (GDB), the relative importance of herbivory and competition have led to the evolution of plant allocation patterns, with herbivore pressure leading to increased differentiated tissues (defensive traits), and competition pressure leading to resource investment towards cellular division and elongation (growth-related traits). Here, we tested the GDB hypothesis by assessing the competitive response of lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) plants with quantitatively different levels of cyanogenesis-a constitutive direct, nitrogen-based defense against herbivores. We used high (HC) and low cyanogenic (LC) genotypes in different competition treatments (intra-genotypic, inter-genotypic, interspecific), and in the presence or absence of insect herbivores (Mexican bean beetle, Epilachna varivestis) to quantify vegetative and generative plant parameters (above and belowground biomass as well as seed production). Highly defended HC-plants had significantly lower aboveground biomass and seed production than LC-plants when grown in the absence of herbivores implying significant intrinsic costs of plant cyanogenesis. However, the reduced performance of HC- compared to LC-plants was mitigated in the presence of herbivores. The two plant genotypes exhibited fundamentally different responses to various stresses (competition, herbivory).

We established 40 monitoring plots within a reforested area, measured their structural features, and determined their relationships with species richness, total abundance, and foraging guild abundance, using Generalized Additive Models. We found that the increasing variation in basal area, stem diameter, and number of stems was positively correlated with species richness, total abundance, and foraging guild abundance. Relationships between richness or abundance and structural features were not lineal, but showing curvilinear responses and thresholds.

We tested the predictions that condition dependence should be more pronounced in male sexual traits and that genetic variance in expression of these traits should increase under stress as among-genotype variation in overall condition is exposed. Genetic variance in female and nonsexual traits should, by contrast, be similar across environments as a result of stabilizing selection on trait expression. The relationship between the degree of sexual dimorphism, condition dependence and additive genetic variance (V-a) was assessed for two morphological traits (body size and relative fore femur width) affecting male mating success in the black scavenger fly Sepsis punctum (Diptera: Sepsidae) and for development time (a nonsexual trait often correlated with body size). We compared trait expression between the sexes for two cross-continental populations that differ in degree of sexual dimorphism (Ottawa and Zurich). Condition dependence was indeed most pronounced in males of the strongly dimorphic Zurich population (males larger), and V-a was similar for males and females unless the trait was strongly sex specific and condition dependent. Contrary to prediction, however, V-a primarily increased under food limitation in both sexes, and genetic variance in fore femur width was low to nil, perhaps depleted by putatively strong sexual selection. Solely for body size of Zurich males, V-a increased more in males than females at limited food, in accordance with the predictions of the genic capture model. Overall therefore, quantitative genetic evidence in support of the model was inconsistent and weak at best.",0,2014,27,11,2408,2419"Engelhardt, KAM; Lloyd, MW; Neel, MC","Effects of genetic diversity on conservation and restoration potential. at individual, population, and regional scales",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,Article,"All available evidence suggests that genetic diversity is important for ecological performance and resilience through the expression and variance of phenotypic traits. Genetic diversity is a multiscalar variable; it includes heterozygosity at the individual scale, genotypic diversity at the population scale, and local adaptation at the regional scale. The three scales of genetic diversity are predominantly studied in isolation to determine conservation status or restoration potential. However, synergisms among the three scales should enhance conservation and restoration assessments. We studied 49 genotypes of Vallisneria americana, a common freshwater submersed aquatic macrophyte that has seen catastrophic declines in its estuarine habitats. Two greenhouse experiments examined phenotypic traits and trade-offs and the effects of genetic diversity on the sustainability of V. americana populations. Clone size, an exploitative guerilla strategy, and plant height, a conservative phalanx strategy, were negatively associated, as were average turion size with clone size and turion abundance, suggesting that growth strategies trade-off to affect plant fitness. Leaf size and turion size were lower in individuals with lower heterozygosity. Early clonal expansion and flowering frequency were enhanced when genotypic richness was higher. Coefficients of variation revealed that opportunities for selection differed across V. americana source beds. We demonstrate that the three scales of genetic diversity work together to determine population performance and evolutionary potential. Thus, integrating the three aspects of genetic diversity is paramount in addressing the impacts of a changing world on the conservation and restoration potential of at-risk populations.

The interaction of stressors from such events has the potential to amplify negative impacts and drive ecosystems into alternate states. Here, we show a drastic response of a temperate seagrass species (Amphibolis antarctica) in Shark Bay - a World Heritage Site in Western Australia at a temperate-tropical transition zone - to two stressors driven by concurrent extreme climatic events: a marine heatwave (Ningaloo Nina) and the Gascoyne floods that impacted the west coast of Australia in the austral summer of 2010-2011. Widespread defoliation (leaf loss) of A.antarctica was observed in the months following the extreme events and was highest at sites affected by flooding (Wooramel River floods). We propose that the negative impact was magnified by the synergistic interactions both stressors had on the carbon balance of the plant. The elevated temperatures increased plant demand for carbon, which could not be met through photosynthesis due to turbid floodwaters reducing light availability, resulting in the plant having a negative carbon balance. Two years following the extreme events, recovery of leaf biomass was evident, though still 7-20% of historical averages. In contrast, below-ground biomass decreased by an order of magnitude in the two years following the events. As below-ground reserves underpin the tolerance of large seagrass species like A.antarctica to disturbances, the declining trajectory of below-ground biomass will likely manifest as a loss of resilience in A. antarctica to future disturbances.Synthesis. Given the ecological importance of Amphibolis antarctica in Shark Bay as a foundation species - accounting for 85% (3700km(2)) of the cover of seagrasses in Shark Bay - predicted increases in the frequency and magnitude of similar climatic events could have catastrophic implications for the future of this World Heritage embayment. Where extreme climatic events overlap and cause multiple, synergistic stressors to plant communities, ecological responses are likely to be more extreme, particularly in ecosystems where foundation species exist near upper thermal tolerance limits.",0,2014,102,6,1528,1536"Jaklic, T; Juvancic, L; Kavcic, S; Debeljak, M",Complementarity of socio-economic and emergy evaluation of agricultural production systems: The case of Slovenian dairy sector,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,Article,"Agriculture is a complex system in which the economic principles of production are directly intertwined with its biological and ecological characteristics. The paper investigates synergetic potentials of multiple:criteria and multiple-perspective evaluation of agricultural activity through a study of the dairy sector in Slovenia. Socioeconomic and emergy evaluation was performed on nine farm types, formulated to represent the diversity of the country's dairy sector. The results indicate larger discrepancies in the performance of the farm types when defined by socio-economic or emergy based indicators. Standard socio-economic evaluation favours larger conventional systems that are cost efficient and financially independent. Emergy analysis however, favours less productive organic farms, which show greater ability to exploit free local resources and produce less stress on the local environment. Socio-economic and emergy indicators show that small conventional farm types are the poorest performers overall. Analysis of emergy flows reveals for all farm types a high dependency on the wider socio-economic system, suggesting that within the current economic system agriculture itself has little ability to affect its sustainability. The paper suggests a complementarity in the evaluation approaches. Their joint application can improve the quality of the decision-making process in various stages of planning in agriculture and land use.

ID often increases under environmental stress, but the combined effects of inbreeding, outbreeding between populations and environmental stress, such as drought, on plant performance and herbivore resistance remain unclear. In order to determine environment-dependent and family-dependent ID, OD and heterosis, we conducted a common garden experiment with plants from five populations of Brassica nigra. Inbred, within-population outbred and between-population outbred plant families were exposed to drought or ambient water levels. We recorded the abundance and damage caused by specialist herbivores from contrasting feeding guilds, that is the phloem-feeding Brevicoryne brassicae, the leaf-chewing Psylliodes chrysocephalus and the stem-boring Ceutorhynchus quadridens larvae. Drought stress had negative effects on growth, herbivore resistance and resistance against B.brassicae and positive effects on investments in reproductive output and plant secondary metabolites (sinigrin). We found drought stress-induced loss of heterosis for plant height and investment in reproductive output. Between-population outbred plants were more sensitive to drought stress in terms of above-ground biomass compared to within-population outbred plants. Drought and inbreeding synergistically negatively influenced traits related to growth and reproductive output (environment-dependent inbreeding depression, EDID). There was high variation among families within populations in the degree of ID and EDID. Genetic variation in EDID could buffer the negative effects of genetic stress associated with habitat fragmentation and concurrent environmental stress. In order to capture fully the effects of both inbreeding and between-population outbreeding under stress, the different spatial scales of the effects of inbreeding and between-population outbreeding should be taken into account.Synthesis. Our results indicate that drought stress influences not only inbreeding depression (ID), but also heterosis. These findings shed new light on the combined effects of anthropogenic environmental change and the genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation on plants and their interactions with other organisms.

Temperature is a major driver of Mg incorporation into the skeletons of calcifying macroalgae, and thus climate change may induce deposition of more soluble calcite, exacerbating responses to OA. Assessment of the skeletal Mg content of 3 geniculate, calcifying species of the genera Corallina and Ellisolandia (Rhodophyta, Corallinales), C. officinalis, C. caespitosa and E. elongata, sampled during 2012-2013 in the UK intertidal, demonstrated the existence of seasonal cycles in skeletal Mg. Seasonal cycles in skeletal Mg were also observed for herbarium collections of the Natural History Museum (British Museum), London, sampled during the recent past (1850-2010). Comparative sampling across a northeastern Atlantic latitudinal transect (Iceland to northern Spain) indicated a decreasing Mg content with increasing latitude for present-day C. officinalis, and relationships between SST and Corallina Mg content (r(2) = 0.45-0.76) demonstrated the dominant influence of temperature on Corallina species skeletal mineralogy. Corallina and Ellisolandia species show lower absolute values of Mg content (0.11-0.16 mol% Mg/Ca), and smaller variation with change in SST (0.0028-0.0047 mol% Mg/Ca degrees C-1), than other temperate calcifying macroalgae studied to date. Over the period 1850-2010, no change in the magnitude of Mg incorporation by C. officinalis was detected in herbarium samples. However, the strong relationship between SST and Mg content indicates that projected increases in SST by 2100, which are far greater than temperature increases that occurred between 1850-2010, could have substantial impact on geniculate coralline algae skeletal mineralogy, and must be considered synergistically with the effects of OA.",0,2014,513,,71,84"Cartwright, SJ; Nicoll, MAC; Jones, CG; Tatayah, V; Norris, K",Agriculture modifies the seasonal decline of breeding success in a tropical wild bird population,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,Article,"1. Habitat conversion for agriculture is a major driver of biodiversity loss, but our understanding of the demographic processes involved remains poor. We typically investigate the impacts of agriculture in isolation even though populations are likely to experience multiple, concurrent changes in the environment (e. g. land and climate change). Drivers of environmental change may interact to affect demography, but the mechanisms have yet to be explored fully in wild populations. 2. Here, we investigate the mechanisms linking agricultural land use with breeding success using long-term data for the formerly Critically Endangered Mauritius kestrel Falco punctatus, a tropical forest specialist that also occupies agricultural habitats. We specifically focused on the relationship between breeding success, agriculture and the timing of breeding because the latter is sensitive to changes in climatic conditions (spring rainfall) and enables us to explore the interactive effects of different (land and climate) drivers of environmental change. 3. Breeding success, measured as egg survival to fledging, declines seasonally in this population, but we found that the rate of this decline became increasingly rapid as the area of agriculture around a nest site increased. If the relationship between breeding success and agriculture was used in isolation to estimate the demographic impact of agriculture, it would significantly under-estimate breeding success in dry (early) springs and over-estimate breeding success in wet (late) springs. 4. Analysis of prey delivered to nests suggests that the relationship between breeding success and agriculture might be due, in part, to spatial variation in the availability of native, arboreal geckos. 5. Synthesis and applications. Agriculture modifies the seasonal decline in breeding success in this population. As springs are becoming wetter in our study area and since the kestrels breed later in wetter springs, the impact of agriculture on breeding success will become worse over time. Our results suggest that forest restoration designed to reduce the detrimental impacts of agriculture on breeding may also help reduce the detrimental effects of breeding late due to wetter springs. Our results therefore highlight the importance of considering the interactive effects of environmental change when managing wild populations.",0,2014,51,5,1387,1395"Grass, I; Berens, DG; Farwig, N",Natural habitat loss and exotic plants reduce the functional diversity of flower visitors in a heterogeneous subtropical landscape,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,Article,"1. Functional diversity (FD) of pollinators can increase plant reproductive output and the stability of plant-pollinator communities. Yet, in times of world-wide pollinator declines, effects of global change on pollinator FD remain poorly understood. Loss of natural habitat and exotic plant invasions are two major drivers of global change that particularly threaten pollinator diversity. 2. In a subtropical South African landscape, we investigated changes in the FD of flower visitor assemblages on native and exotic plants along gradients of natural habitat loss and relative abundance of exotic plants. We used a data set of 1434 flower visitor individuals sampled on 131 focal plants and calculated the FD in three flower visitor traits that are strongly related to plant-flower visitor interactions and pollination processes: proboscis length, proboscis diameter and body length. 3. Multivariate FD of flower visitors decreased with both increasing natural habitat loss and relative exotic abundance. Importantly, changes in FD went beyond those in flower visitor richness. Furthermore, flower visitor richness was not related to either natural habitat loss or relative exotic abundance. Loss in multivariate FD seemed to be mediated by complementary reductions of FD in proboscis length with natural habitat loss and of FD in body length with both global change drivers. Correspondingly, we recorded lower abundances of long-tongued flower visitors with natural habitat loss and reduced variance in body size with both drivers. In contrast, FD in proboscis diameter was unaffected by either driver. All effects of the two global change drivers were non-interactive. 4. Our results show that both natural habitat loss and exotic plants negatively affect flower visitor FD, which may imperil pollination of specialized plant species in degraded habitats. In contrast, flower visitor richness may not cover all facets of flower visitor FD that are relevant to pollination processes. Distinct responses of visitor traits to the two drivers suggest limited options to infer relations of one trait to another. Finally, additive effects of natural habitat loss and exotic plant invasions highlight the need to consider multiple drivers of global change when investigating ecosystem processes at a community scale.",0,2014,28,5,1117,1126"Alonso-Fernandez, A; Otero, J; Villegas-Rios, D; Banon, R",Drivers of body size changes in a Pollachius pollachius stock in NE Atlantic coastal waters,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,Article,"Fish body size is a key life history trait that influences population dynamics.

Pollack body size showed strong spatio-temporal patterns, with an inshore-offshore geographic gradient where smaller fish were associated with shallower waters. Moreover, body size displayed a seasonal cycle, with larger individuals occurring mainly in winter months. This seasonality matches the annual reproductive cycle of the species.

We therefore examined the effects of community properties, environmental variables and human-related disturbance factors on the invasion of the alien grass Echinochloa colona (L.) Link at small- and large scales in the Kilombero Valley wetland, Tanzania. Generalized additive mixed models showed that E. colona abundance on a small scale was negatively related to above-ground biomass and evenness of resident species, whereas E. colona abundance was positively related to grazing intensity. On a large scale, biomass (negatively related to E. colona abundance) and distance to river (positive) were important in explaining E. colona abundance. These findings support the assertion that different factors may contribute to the invasion of alien plant species at different spatial scales, as also reported in many temperate systems. Overall, our results show that successful invasion of alien species is a function of plant community properties, human-related disturbance and favourable environmental conditions.

We analyzed the avoidance or preference responses of Amur tiger distribution to elevation, snow depth and Viewshed.

We used a daily mechanistic ecosystem model to generate 40-yr outputs using observed climatic data for scenarios of decreased precipitation (25-100%); increased ail. temperature (1 degrees-6 degrees C); simultaneous changes in both precipitation (+/-50%, +/-25%) and air temperature (+1 to +6 degrees C) and increased interannual variability (IAV) of precipitation (+1 sigma to +3 sigma, with fixed means, where a is SD). We fitted model output from these scenarios to Huxman et al.'s RUEmAx bioclimatic model, NPP = alpha + RUE X PPT (where alpha is the intercept, RUE is rain use efficiency, and PPT is annual precipitation). Based on these analyses, we conclude that there is strong support (when not explicit, then trend-wise) for Huxman et al.'s assertion that biomes converge to a common RUEmAx during the driest years at a site, thus representing the boundary for highest rain use efficiency; the interactive effects of simultaneously decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature on NPP for the TP is smaller than might be expected from additive, single-factor changes in these drivers; and that increasing IAV. of precipitation may ultimately have a larger impact on biomes of the Tibetan Plateau than changing amounts of rainfall and air temperature alone.",0,2014,95,8,2109,2120"Lakeman-Fraser, P; Ewers, RM",Untangling interactions: do temperature and habitat fragmentation gradients simultaneously impact biotic relationships?,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,Article,"Gaining insight into the impact of anthropogenic change on ecosystems requires investigation into interdependencies between multiple drivers of ecological change and multiple biotic responses.

Secondly, we examined how these interactions might differentially impact both the density and biotic processes of species at each of the three trophic levels. We found evidence to suggest that these drivers act non-additively across trophic levels. The nature of these interactions however varied: location synergistically interacted with fragmentation measures to exacerbate the detrimental effects on consumer density; and antagonistically interacted to ameliorate the impact on plant density and on the interactions between trophic levels (herbivory and parasitoid attack rate).

In both experiments, survival and calcification were not affected by elevated pCO(2). However, feeding rates decreased strongly with increasing pCO(2), while aerobic metabolism and NH4+ excretion were not significantly affected by CO2 exposure. Consequently, high pCO(2) reduced the scope for growth in A. rubens. Growth rates decreased substantially with increasing pCO(2) and were reduced even at pCO(2) levels occurring in the habitat today (e.g. during upwelling events). Sea stars were not able to acclimate to higher pCO(2), and growth performance did not recover during the long-term experiment. Therefore, the top-down control exerted by this keystone species may be diminished during periods of high environmental pCO(2) that already occur occasionally and will be even higher in the future. However, some individuals were able to grow at high rates even at high pCO(2), indicating potential for rapid adaption.

O. franklini was found to reach extremely high densities (> 41000 m(-2)), yet abundance was strongly heterogeneous on all spatial scales tested. Temporal variation in abundance was also significant and was location-specific, potentially reflecting fluctuations in food supply and variable conditions resulting from ice disturbance. Principal component analysis and generalised additive modelling revealed evidence of a relationship between the distribution of O. franklini and the sediment, which was consistent with its deposit-feeding trophic niche. Generally, the abundance of O. franklini increased with de creasing sediment grain size and increasing trace element concentration.

Intertidal boulder reefs with different rock types often have distinct benthic assemblages, and their ecology is structured strongly by succession. Therefore, dynamics causing assemblage variability may involve an interaction of factors involved in succession with features of the substratum. The current experiments monitored 11 month successional trajectories of benthic invertebrates on 2 rock types (siltstone and limestone) with differing physical characteristics. Unmanipulated boulders in siltstone and limestone reefs had different assemblages, but when bare boulders of the non-native rock type were transplanted into reefs, assemblages developing on non-native boulders were in most ways similar to those on boulders of the reef's native rock type. A substratum-dependent variation in successional trajectories was observed for one taxon, the true limpet Notoacmea spp. Under specific conditions of rock type at the individual boulder scale and the wider reef scale, evidence was found of a consistent peak in abundance during early succession. Notoacmea spp. was also positively associated not only with siltstone reefs but also with individual siltstone boulders, suggesting an effect of rock type at the boulder scale. Although processes occurring at scales encompassing whole reefs mostly dictate how these assemblages are associated with rock type, some species are affected by rock type at the boulder scale, and the effect can vary during succession. For such species, successional processes and environmental factors need to be considered synergistically to understand spatial and temporal population variability.",0,2014,505,,131,143"Miranda-Jacome, A; Montana, C; Fornoni, J",Environmentally dependent expression of heritable variation on early recruitment traits induced by light conditions and provenance in the columnar cactus Pilosocereus leucocephalus,PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS,Article,"Response to selection depends on heritable genetic variation, which is affected by environmental conditions. The present study experimentally assessed whether the effect of light-related stress and the attenuating effect of shade as a facilitator of seedling germination, survival and growth affect the expression of heritable variation and the potential for a response to selection in the columnar cactus Pilosocereus leucocephalus. A reciprocal transplant experiment combined with the artificial manipulation of light/shade conditions within greenhouses was performed using seeds from controlled crosses of two natural populations (demes PN and SI). Additive genetic variance (V-A), heritability (h(2)) and the coefficient of variation of additive variance (CVA) were estimated for per cent of germination, per cent of seedling survival and growth (biomass) under each treatment combination. Although all three recruitment traits showed evidence of different from zero heritability, this result was highly dependent upon the particular transplant site, deme and light treatment combination. The deme that is still not locally adapted (SI) showed significant heritability for all traits and much more potential for a response selection as indicated by a higher CVA than the locally adapted deme PN. The effect of light conditions on the expression of V-A, h(2) and CVA depended on whether the deme was grown in its native or an alien site, but this interaction was only detected for the less adapted deme of SI. Shade conditions promoted by facilitation reduced the evolutionary potential for germination of both demes through an attenuation of genetic differences among genotypes.

Insights from a Watershed in Kenya,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,Article,"Climate change presents new challenges for the management of social-ecological systems and the ecosystem services they provide. Although the instrument of payments for ecosystem services (PES) has emerged as a promising tool to safeguard or enhance the provision of ecosystem services (ES), little attention has been paid to the potential role of PES in climate change adaptation. As an external stressor climate change has an impact on the social-ecological system in which PES takes place, including the various actors taking part in the PES scheme. Following a short description of the conceptual link between PES and adaptation to climate change, we provide practical insights into the relationship between PES and adaptation to climate change by presenting results from a case study of a rural watershed in Kenya. Drawing upon the results of a participatory vulnerability assessment among potential ecosystem service providers in Sasumua watershed north of Nairobi, we show that PES can play a role in enhancing adaptation to climate change by influencing certain elements of adaptive capacity and incentivizing adaptation measures. In addition, trade-offs and synergies between proposed measures under PES and adaptation to climate change are identified. Results show that although it may not be possible to establish PES schemes based on water utilities as the sole source of financing, embedding PES in a wider adaptation framework creates an opportunity for the development of watershed PES schemes in Africa and ensures their sustainability. We conclude that there is a need to embed PES in a wider institutional framework and that extra financial resources are needed to foster greater integration between PES and adaptation to climate change. This can be achieved through scaling up PES by bringing in other buyers and additional ecosystem services. PES can achieve important coadaptation benefits, but for more effective adaptation outcomes it needs to be combined with vulnerability assessments and climate scenarios to ensure that these are realized and potential trade-offs between PES measures and adaptation measures minimized.",0,2014,19,1,,"Saenz, D; Fucik, EM; Kwiatkowski, MA",Synergistic effects of the invasive Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera) and climate change on aquatic amphibian survival,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Article,"Changes in climate and the introduction of invasive species are two major stressors to amphibians, although little is known about the interaction between these two factors with regard to impacts on amphibians. We focused our study on an invasive tree species, the Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera), that annually sheds its leaves and produces leaf litter that is known to negatively impact aquatic amphibian survival. The purpose of our research was to determine whether the timing of leaf fall from Chinese tallow and the timing of amphibian breeding (determined by weather) influence survival of amphibian larvae. We simulated a range of winter weather scenarios, ranging from cold to warm, by altering the relative timing of when leaf litter and amphibian larvae were introduced into aquatic mesocosms. Our results indicate that amphibian larvae survival was greatly affected by the length of time Chinese tallow leaf litter decomposes in water prior to the introduction of the larvae. Larvae in treatments simulating warm winters (early amphibian breeding) were introduced to the mesocosms early in the aquatic decomposition process of the leaf litter and had significantly lower survival compared with cold winters (late amphibian breeding), likely due to significantly lower dissolved oxygen levels. Shifts to earlier breeding phenology, linked to warming climate, have already been observed in many amphibian taxa, and with most climate models predicting a significant warming trend over the next century, the trend toward earlier breeding should continue if not increase. Our results strongly suggest that a warming climate can interact with the effects of invasive plant species, in ways we have not previously considered, to reduce the survival of an already declining group of organisms.",0,2013,3,14,4828,4840"Wieters, EA; Medrano, A; Quiroga, G",Spatial variation in photosynthetic recovery of intertidal turf algae from acute UVB and temperature stress associated with low tides along the central coast of Chile,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,Article,"Ecological consequences of punctuated, extreme climate events depend largely upon species' physiological capacity to tolerate and recover from such stressful events. However, physiological responses of intertidal organisms to repetitive exposure to severe conditions using natural patterns are rarely explored, and we know little about how physiological sensitivity within a species varies over local scales or among natural populations, making it difficult to extrapolate results to the naturally variable environmental conditions encountered in the field. Here, we simulate realistic scenarios of the exposure of the turf-forming alga (Gelidium chilense) to atmospheric stressors (UVB and temperature) associated with natural mild or harsh weather conditions that occur when summertime midday low tides coincide with unusually calm seas and particularly warm, sunny days along the central Chilean coast. We show that sudden, short-term exposure to artificial UVB radiation during daytime low tides represents a strong stress factor for Gelidium turf algae as measured by the changes in maximal photosynthetic quantum yield (Fv/Fm), and repetitive exposure over a period of 5 d, as it occurs naturally during spring summer days, can critically compromise the ability of the fronds to recover once the stressor is removed. In contrast, while increased aerial temperature had important effects on the photosynthetic system, this source of stress had no lasting effects on the fronds' capacity to recover, nor did it modify the UVB effects on photosynthesis (i.e. no synergistic effects between these common stressors). The ability of Gelidium turf to recover from UVB-induced damage to the photosynthetic apparatus differed between tidal heights and among populations from different sites along the central coast. These results suggest that for many shore communities, abrupt, unpredictable short-term stress events will have greater consequences lower on the shore. We found no evidence that greater upwelling intensity and associated nutrient enrichment of coastal waters could consistently ameliorate recovery from the negative effects of UVB. The complex spatial variation in the turfs ability to recover rapidly from a stress event may alter predictions regarding the effects of extreme climate events and/or climate change on species interactions and species' geographic distribution.

Patch occupancy decreases with the turnover of the metapopulation dynamics and therefore the population prone to extinct. We have been examining the occurrence of endangered and strictly protected Hungarian root vole subspecies (Microtus oeconomus mehelyi) within the framework of Hungarian Biodiversity Monitoring System Program in Kis-Balaton. We analyzed the dynamics of root vole site occupancy based on 12-year-long period data. From a conservation aspect we investigated how root vole site occupancy dynamics differed in the area under NATURA 2000 protected marshland habitat management and in the privatized marshland under regular perturbation, compared to the initial, disturbance-free conditions. We applied multi-season occupancy models and we took into consideration the effects of perturbance, such as burning and mowing, and natural disturbances such as water cover and weather (wetter, drier weather period). Based on monitoring data there were 397 successful root vole captures and we identified 262 individuals. The results of both detection and occupancy estimates showed that the comprehensive mowing affecting the entire privatized area appeared as a disturbing effect, causing the emigration of the root voles. Most important factor in the loss of root vole is the additive effects of burning and natural aridity. Disturbances and perturbations of certain areas induce movements and spatial translocations which play role in the exchange of genes and individuals, ensuring to maintain the genetic variability of the remaining relict population.

Therefore, the finding of chitosan-induced anti-fungal activity in plants suggested a promising potential. Consequently, we treated autotroph and heterotroph Chenopodium rubrum L. cell cultures with chitosan to test behavioural activity with Tenebrio molitor L. larvae. We found chitosans to enhance repelling, depending on low molecular weight, partial degree of deacetylation, plant cell type and age.

Behavioural activity was quantified by linear, multivariate and nonlinear approaches, testing an exponential model in 78 segments of 5 h time kinetics. Thereby, we introduced a sensitive, low-cost bio-assay and a preference index constant as a measure of transient behaviour.

In the rangelands of semi-arid and arid Australia, the thorny acacia, Acacia farnesiana (L.) Willd., is apparently encroaching into grasslands and changing the structure, composition, and functioning of native grasslands. The potential for A. farnesiana to expand rapidly in response to changes in land use was examined by quantifying the reproductive output, dispersal, seed-bank density, and germination of seeds of A. farnesiana. Even in the absence of high grazing pressure, low numbers of seeds were produced and these were mainly locally dispersed, although long-distance dispersal via floods could occur. Pre-dispersal seed predation is likely to reduce the seed output, and despite strong physical seed dormancy, soil-stored seed banks were not large. Seed dormancy is broken by scarification but not strongly synergistically with fire or by fire alone, and fire may have a small effect on recruitment. Hence, pulse recruitment seems unlikely given the match between seedling densities and seed-bank density. These patterns suggest that A. farnesiana is unlikely to encroach rapidly into grasslands unless there is widespread landscape disturbance that triggers broad-scale dispersal, such as floods, and or physical scarification of seed.",0,2013,35,4,427,433"Gagnon, PR; Passmore, HA; Platt, WJ",MULTI-YEAR SALUTARY EFFECTS OF WINDSTORM AND FIRE ON RIVER CANE,FIRE ECOLOGY,Article,"Canebrakes are monodominant stands of cane (Arundinaria gigantea [Walter] Muhl.), a bamboo native to and once prominent in the southeastern USA. Canebrakes were important wildlife habitat within the bottom land hardwood forest ecosystem. They have been reduced in areal coverage by an estimated 98 % since European settlement due to land conversion and the drastic alteration of disturbance regimes in their floodplain habitat. Ongoing canebrake restoration efforts are hampered by incomplete understanding of the role of natural disturbance in cane ecology. We used a large tornado blowdown and multiple prescribed fires to quantify the response of cane to the sequential disturbances of windstorm and fire in the Tensas Watershed of northeastern Louisiana using number and condition of bamboo stems (culms) as response variables. We hypothesized that culms would be more abundant in burned than in unburned stands and that culm populations in burned stands would be younger than in unburned stands. In this study, conducted four years post fire, effects of both windstorm and burning were additive and beneficial. Results indicate that periodic aboveground disturbance has three salutary effects on cane ramet demography: 1) clonal growth following disturbances more than compensates for any culms killed; 2) the cohort of new culms is younger than the culms they replace; and 3) disturbance appears to inoculate some cane stands for several years against local die-offs. Fire is a valuable tool for canebrake management.

The situation is especially acute in Mediterranean ecosystems where the high human population density incurs multiple sources of disturbance and high propagule pressure. In this study, we characterize the relationship between native and exotic forest insect richness and evaluate how human-mediated disturbances can influence this relationship in the Mediterranean central Chile. Exotic and native species richness were positively correlated across the study area, suggesting similar effect of environmental variables on both assemblages over large scales. When the effect of human-mediated disturbances was evaluated using generalized linear and additive models, we found that native richness, human population density and habitat diversity were the most important variables affecting exotic richness. Moreover, we detected strong nonlinearities in the effect of some variables. For instance, the influence of human population density on the exotic richness followed a threshold function, where below 1,000 hab/km(2), the proportion of exotics in the community grew rapidly with increasing human density, but above this threshold density, human population did not produce further increases in exotic richness. Two important conclusions arise from these results: first, there is a positive effect of human-mediated disturbances on the exotic richness in central Chile, and second, the key role that human population density has on the invasibility of insect communities in rural and semi-rural Mediterranean areas.",0,2012,21,14,3699,3710"Lloyd, JD; Slater, GL; Snyder, JR",THE ROLE OF FIRE-RETURN INTERVAL AND SEASON OF BURN IN SNAG DYNAMICS IN A SOUTH FLORIDA SLASH PINE FOREST,FIRE ECOLOGY,Article,"Standing dead trees, or snags, are an important habitat element for many animal species. In many ecosystems, fire is a primary driver of snag population dynamics because it can both create and consume snags. The objective of this study was to examine how variation in two key components of the fire regime-fire-return interval and season of burn-affected population dynamics of snags. Using a factorial design, we exposed 1 ha plots, located within larger burn units in a south Florida slash pine (Pinus elliottii var. densa Little and Dorman) forest, to prescribed fire applied at two intervals (approximately 3-year intervals vs. approximately 6-year intervals) and during two seasons (wet season vs. dry season) over a 12- to 13-year period. We found no consistent effect of fire season or frequency on the density of lightly to moderately decayed or heavily decayed snags, suggesting that variation in these elements of the fire regime at the scale we considered is relatively unimportant in the dynamics of snag populations. However, our confidence in these findings is limited by small sample sizes, potentially confounding effects of unmeasured variation in fire behavior and effects (e. g., intensity, severity, synergy with drought cycles) and wide variation in responses within a treatment level. The generalizing of our findings is also limited by the narrow range of treatment levels considered.

The environmental assessment literature emphasizes a similar phenomenon at the population level, arguing that populations can compensate for perturbations up to a threshold, beyond which disturbance impacts may be greatly magnified-and even cause system collapse. We integrated these two approaches to examine the roles of environment, life history stage, prior disturbance experience, and their interactions on vulnerability to disturbance in a free-living species. Specifically, we examined the effects of off-highway vehicle use on the federally threatened northern spotted owl (NSO), Strix occidentalis caurina, by measuring fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCs), which reflect disturbance; fecal thyroid hormone metabolites (fT3), which reflect nutrition; and the number of offspring fledged within a season. We experimentally applied one hour of motorcycle exposure to NSOs during periods of incubation (May) and fledging (July), comparing fGC levels of treated NSO with those of non-exposed controls. Acute vehicle exposure generally increased fGCs in the short term. Males showed the highest glucocorticoid response to vehicle disturbance in May when they were typically solely responsible for feeding themselves, their mates and their nestlings. By contrast, response to motorcycle exposure among females depended on their level of fT3 and their number of young. Levels of fGCs were highest post treatment among females that lacked young and had high fT3 (good nutrition); fGC levels were lower in treated females compared to controls among females with two young and low fT3 (compromised nutrition), possibly reflecting allostatic overload. The correlational approach showed that NSO close to roads had higher levels of fT3, suggesting better nutrition. Surprisingly, fGC levels were unrelated to proximity of roads, irrespective of noise. Presumably, the tendency for traffic exposure to increase fGCs over the long-term was offset by nutritional gains (i.e., reduced fGCs and high fT3) associated with proximity to roads. Sound level meters enabled us to quantify road noise on a subset of NSO territories. NSO close to noisy roads fledged significantly fewer young than NSO near quiet roads, indicating that routine traffic exposure may decrease NSO reproductive success over time.",0,2011,2,6,,"Reeves, MK; Perdue, M; Blakemore, GD; Rinella, DJ; Holyoak, M",Twice as easy to catch? A toxicant and a predator cue cause additive reductions in larval amphibian activity,ECOSPHERE,Article,"Toxicants may harm predators or prey differentially, hindering clear determination of multiple stressor effects on predation dynamics in polluted aquatic systems. We built on a prior field study in which we demonstrated that a chemical contaminant, copper (Cu) and odonate predators were correlated with more frequent observations of skeletal abnormalities in Alaskan wood frog (Rana sylvatica) tadpoles. Our prior study established a multiple stressor effect linked to an important environmental phenomenon (malformed amphibians) but did not provide clear mechanisms that might guide management. We here investigated behavioral mechanisms because of their potential to produce large changes in predation dynamics, and because in published studies low concentrations of Cu produced behavioral changes in predator-detection in fish. Surprisingly, low but environmentally relevant concentrations of Cu (5 mu g/L) combined with chemical cues from a predator (Aeshna sitchensis) to produce large changes in the behavior of larval amphibians. Experiments demonstrated that a low concentration of Cu did not inhibit the ability of wood frog tadpoles to detect chemical cues of predators by olfactory means, but produced strong behavioral effects, causing tadpoles to reduce activity and alter microhabitat use. These results occurred with Cu at an exposure level lower than any we could find reported as toxic to amphibians in the literature. When Cu and predator cues were administered together, the activity reduction was additive and stronger at earlier life stages. We suggest that Cu intoxication would be disadvantageous to larval amphibian prey with prolonged exposure to predators during development, and we present field data from 2010 that support this assertion.

The fish assemblage was indicative of those found in least disturbed areas within the Potomac basin, while salamander abundance and richness indicated areas of habitat degradation.

One possibility is that the ability to resist senescence is limited by the availability of antioxidants, which are necessary to mitigate the deleterious effects of oxidative stress thought to underlie the aging process. Susceptibility to oxidative stress is likely to be particularly high during reproduction, and so for a given level of reproductive effort, the rate of senescence should be fastest in those individuals with the poorest antioxidant capacity. We tested this hypothesis in an experimental study of breeding male three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) held under a high or low reproduction regime and fed on either high or low levels of carotenoids (potentially limiting dietary compounds with antioxidant properties). Fish on the high reproduction regime and those on the low-carotenoid diet both showed an accelerated decline in sustained swimming performance (an indicator of locomotor senescence) compared with males on the low reproduction regime and high-carotenoid diet, respectively. The swimming performance of fish subjected to the high rate of reproduction, but fed a low-carotenoid diet, appeared to decline most rapidly, perhaps because of the additive effects of increased levels of reproduction-induced oxidative stress and lower antioxidant availability. These findings show that both dietary carotenoid intake and breeding effort can impact on the age-related decline in swimming performance and have important implications for female choice and the capacity of males with insufficient antioxidant defenses to adequately perform paternal care.",0,2010,21,5,1048,1053"Coors, A; De Meester, L","Synergistic, antagonistic and additive effects of multiple stressors: predation threat, and pesticide exposure in Daphnia magna (vol 45, pg 1820, 2008)",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,Correction,,0,2009,46,5,1138,1138"Wendel, CM; Smee, DL",Ambient Malathion concentrations modify behavior and increase mortality in blue crabs,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,Article,"Organophosphate insecticides can compromise water quality and harm non-target species unintentionally.

Adult and juvenile crabs were exposed to environmentally-occurring concentrations of Malathion at 2 salinity levels to determine how these factors would affect crab behavior and mortality. Initial Malathion concentrations of 1.0 ppb and 11.2 ppb caused a significant increase in mortality of juvenile blue crabs, and concentrations of 11.2 ppb caused a significant increase in mortality of adults, all within 36 h after exposure.

Modelling approach: We let dispersal distance evolve within an individual-based model involving an obligate plant-pollinating seed parasite pair and a parasitoid that preys upon pollinator larvae. The model incorporates demographic parameters for ovule production, pollinator oviposition, pollinator and parasitoid visitation rates, in addition to background mortality probabilities for each of the three species. A corresponding non-spatial mathematical model verifies our representation of the interspecific dynamics. Key assumptions: Individuals move over a homogeneous underlying environment with dispersal distances drawn from probability distribution kernels. Each species is subject to density-dependent reproduction. Pollinators and parasitoids make multiple visits per time step that are Poisson distributed. Conclusions: Dependent on demographic parameter values, there is a spectrum of outcomes, including: (1) runaway selection for increased dispersal distance resulting in homogeneous distributions of all three species; (2) an evolutionarily stable state with pattern formation and metapopulation-like dynamics; and (3) rapid extinction of one or more species.

For instance, radiation risk is estimated from physical dose (energy per mass unit), using radiation and tissue weighting factors and risk coefficients derived from epidemiology. However, for exposure to multiple stressor this approach is complicated, and deviations from simple additive models are common. Chromosomal aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes have long been considered a biomarker of cancer risk. In fact, cytogenetic damage in blood cells reflect similar events occurring in target organs, and take into account the interaction of different clastogenic agents, individual sensitivity, genetic background, physiological status, synergisms, etc. New molecular techniques allow a careful and unequivocal identification of several chromosomal rearrangements and can be used to provide biologically motivated risk estimates, to be compared with the estimates coming from field measurements of dose, concentration, etc. One example of exposure to multiple stressors where cytogenetic biomarkers have been widely used is manned space exploration. During space flight, astronauts are exposed to cosmic radiation while sustaining several other stresses, primarily weightlessness. It is well known that spaceflight environment has large effects on the immune system and produce several physiological alterations. The interaction of these stresses, especially microgravity, with radiation exposure has been long studied in vitro, with contradictory results. However, measurements of cytogenetic biomarkers in astronauts have demonstrated that the radiation risk is not higher than expected from ground-based studies. The use of biomarkers is therefore particularly useful for the exposure to multiple stressors.",0,2007,,,287,293"Geras'kin, SA; Oudalova, AA; Dikarev, VG; Dikareva, NS; Evseeva, TI",Effects of multipollutant exposures on plant populations,Multiple Stressors: A Challenge for the Future,Proceedings Paper,"Results of laboratory, ""green-house"" and long-term field experiments carried out on different plant species to study ecotoxical effects of low doses and concentrations of most common environmental pollutants are presented. Special attention is paid to ecotoxic effects of chronic low dose exposures, synergistic and antagonistic effects of multipollutant exposure. Plant populations growing in areas with relatively low levels of pollution are characterized by the increased level of both cytogenetic disturbances and genetic diversity. The chronic low dose exposure appears to be an ecological factor creating preconditions for possible changes in the genetic structure of a population. A long-term existence of some factors (either of natural origin or man-made) in the plants environment activates genetic mechanisms, changing a population's resistance to exposure. However, in different radioecological situations, genetic adaptation of plant populations to extreme edaphic conditions could be achieved at different rates. The findings presented indicate clearly that an adequate environment quality assessment cannot rely only on information about pollutant concentrations. This conclusion emphasizes the need to update some current principles of ecological standardization, which are still in use today.",0,2007,,,73,89"Mothersill, C; Seymour, C",Radiation risks in the context of multiple stressors in the environment-issues for consideration,Multiple Stressors: A Challenge for the Future,Proceedings Paper,"The field of multiple stressors is highly complex. Agents can interact in an additive, antagonist or synergistic manner. The outcome following low dose multiple stressor exposure also is impacted by the context in which the stressors are received or perceived by the organism or tissue. Modem biology has given us very sensitive tools to access change following stressor interaction with biological systems at several levels of organization but the effect-harm-risk relationship remains difficult to resolve. This paper reviews some of the issues, using low dose ionizing radiation as a common stressor and chemicals known to act through similar mechanisms, as examples Since multiple stressor exposure is the norm in the environment, it is essential to move away from single stressor based protection and to develop tools, including legal instruments, which will enable us to use response-based risk assessment. The problem of radiation protection in the context of multiple stressors includes consideration of humans and non-humans as separate groups requiring separate assessment frameworks. This is because for humans, individual survival and prevention of cancer are paramount but for animals, it is considered sufficient to protect populations and cancer is not of concern. The need to revisit this position is discussed not only from the environmental perspective but because the importance of pollution as a cause of non-cancer disease is increasingly being recognized. Finally a way forward involving experimental assessment of biomarker performance coupled with modeling is discussed.",0,2007,,,235,246"Dmitriev, A; Guscha, N; Krizanovska, M",Synergism of low dose chronic radiation and biotic stress for plants,Equidosimetry - Ecological Standardization and Equidosimetry for Radioecology and Environmental Ecology,Proceedings Paper,,0,2005,2,,231,236"Jankovsky, L; Cudlin, P; Cermak, P; Moravec, I",The prediction of development of secondary Norway spruce stands under the impact of climatic change in the Drahany Highlands (the Czech Republic),EKOLOGIA-BRATISLAVA,Article,"The aim of the study was to define the rate of stress load of existing Norway spruce stands of nutrient-rich sites of the Drahany Highlands (the Czech Republic) and to predict its further development with respect to risks of the activation of fungal pathogens and insect pests. In the past, stands under conditions of the 3(rd) and 4(th) forest vegetation zones of the Drahany Highlands were relatively slightly up to moderately loaded by synergistic effects of natural and anthropogenic stress factors on assimilatory organs. In the majority of stands, the inner tolerance of trees to the stressors has been already exceeded. However, the adaptation potential of stands to multiple stress impact has not been used up yet. Changed climatic conditions predicted by the climatic change scenarios will result in the destabilization of existing spruce stands. The stand disintegration will be accompanied with the acceleration of Armillaria sp. and cambioxylophagous insect as mortality stressors. It is possible to expect that growing spruce in the present 1(st) to 3(rd) forest vegetation zones will not be possible. Similarly, in the most distributed Management Group 45 nutrient-rich sites of medium altitudes, it is possible to expect destabilization and disintegration of existing stands.",0,2004,23,,101,112"Kochubey, SM; Pardalos, PM; Yatsenko, VA",Method and the device for remote sensing of vegetation,"REMOTE SENSING FOR AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS, AND HYDROLOGY IV",Proceedings Paper,In this paper we consider the problem of estimating chlorophyll content in vegetation using an experimental optical method from noisy spectral data. It is shown that the quantitative analysis of the spectral curves for the reflection of plant leaves may be the basis for development of new methods for interpretation of the data obtained by the remote measurement of plants. A mathematical model of vegetation reflectance is proposed to estimate the chlorophyll concentration from spectral data. Estimates are defined as minimizers of penalized cost functionals with sequential quadratic programming (SQP) methods. An estimation tool is related to the local scoring procedure for a generalized additive model. Experimental and simulation results are shown for different agricultural plants using a functional parametric fitting of spectral curves.,0,2003,4879,,243,251"Fedorenko, SI",Tolerance of birch stands of the northern Transural forest steppe to abiotic and biotic stress factors,RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Article,"It is shown that both diffuse and complete drying of birch stands is due to the additive effects of meteorological factors (hydrothermal parameters of the first and second halves of the growing period) and tree defoliation by phyllophagous insects, with the former being of primary importance.",0,2001,32,6,432,436
