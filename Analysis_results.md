## Results from Analysis of citation rates
### 1 Oct 2015


Used a negative binomial analysis of citations counts, because there was over-dispersion.
Tried models with journal as a random effect, but classes are too unbalanced.  

There was a years since publication effect, and spline fitting indicated that linear was most parsimonious.
Including all papers we found that papers that mention synerg* have a significantly higher citation rate (partial size of ~ + 0.5) than papers mentioning additive or antagonistic effects.  

However, excluding reviews and notes (~90 papers) there was no significant effect of interactions.

The pattern of higher citations in synerg* papers seems to be driven by a few highly cited reviews.

So the question is, did those papers get more citations for claiming synergy, or is the important point just that these high profile papers that set the scene don't mention synergies?

Need to redo analysis, but avoid melting columns (which duplicates some entries)
Also, Em is updating the database
