conversely they provide comprehensive views of species distributions allowing to realistically capture most of their realized environmental niche. rare species are the most in need of predictive distribution modelling but also the most difficult to model. we refer to this contrast as the ""rare species modelling paradox"" and propose as a solution developing modelling approaches that deal with a sufficiently large set of predictors, ensuring that statistical models are not over-fitted. our novel approach fulfils this condition by fitting a large number of bivariate models and averaging them with a weighted ensemble approach. we further propose that this ensemble forecasting is conducted within a hierarchic multi-scale framework. we present two ensemble models for a test species, one at regional and one at local scale, each based on the combination of 630 models. in both cases, we obtained excellent spatial projections, unusual when modelling rare species. model results highlight, from a statistically sound approach, the effects of multiple drivers in a same modelling framework and at two distinct scales. from this added information, regional models can support accurate forecasts of range dynamics under climate change scenarios, whereas local models allow the assessment of isolated or synergistic impacts of changes in multiple predictors. this novel framework provides a baseline for adaptive conservation, management and monitoring of rare species at distinct spatial and temporal scales.

abundance of elasmopus levis responded negatively to freshwater pulses, whereas abundance of gammarus mucronatus and erichsonella attenuata responded positively or neutrally. consistent with the hypothesis that biodiversity provides resistance stability, biomass of epiphytic algae that form the base of the food web was less affected by stressors in species-rich grazer treatments than in single-species grazer treatments. stochastic (among-replicate) variation of sessile invertebrate biomass within treatments was also reduced in more diverse grazer treatments. therefore, grazer species richness tended to increase the resistance stability of both major components of the seagrass fouling community, algae and invertebrates, in the face of environmental stressors. finally, in our model system, multi-stressor impacts suggested a pattern of antagonism contrary to previous assumptions of synergistic stressor effects. overall, our results confirm that invertebrate grazer species are functionally diverse in their response to environmental stressors, but are largely functionally redundant in their grazing effects leading to greater resistance stability of certain ecosystem properties in diverse grazer assemblages even when influenced by multiple environmental stressors.",16,2010,119,10,1625,1635,10.1111/j.1600-0706.2010.18419.x,1,1,0,2"Ochoa-Hueso, R;

kittiwake; parental care; prolactin; seabird; stress,"p>an emergency life-history stage is expressed in breeding vertebrates when the immediate survival is threatened by poor energetic conditions (i.e. allostatic overload). this emergency life-history stage shifts energy investment away from reproduction and redirects it toward immediate survival. in birds, this emergency life-history stage is promoted by a release of the stress hormone corticosterone. however, how corticosterone reduces the expression of parental cares remains to be clarified. one hypothesis is that the release of corticosterone may also affect prolactin levels, a pituitary hormone widely involved in regulating parental behaviours. we tested this hypothesis by experimentally increasing corticosterone levels of chick-rearing black-legged kittiwakes (rissa tridactyla) over a 2-day period and by monitoring prolactin levels over an 8-day period. we also investigated whether this hormonal manipulation affected nest attendance, the motivation to come back to the nest after a short-term stress and breeding success. corticosterone treatment resulted in a significant increase in plasma corticosterone levels during the first 2 days, which returned to pre-treatment values at day 3. this short-term corticosterone increase was accompanied by a 30% decrease in prolactin levels. prolactin levels were reduced in a progressive and persistent manner and did not return to their initial levels when corticosterone levels returned to pre-treatment levels. moreover, although corticosterone levels had returned to pre-treatment values, low prolactin levels were associated with a reduced nest attendance and a greater latency to come back to the nest after a short-term stress. this hormonal treatment also significantly reduced breeding success. this experimental treatment strongly supports the idea that the secretion of these two hormones might be mechanistically linked. thus, we showed that even a relatively short-term increase in corticosterone levels can durably affect plasma prolactin levels. therefore, the well-established suppressive action of corticosterone on parental behaviour is probably mediated and reinforced through an effect on prolactin levels. this study highlights the need to consider the potential synergistic effects of these two hormones when studying on the hormonal basis of parental decisions.",58,2009,23,4,784,793,10.1111/j.1365-2435.2009.01545.x,1,0,0,1"Humair, B;

when grazers are excluded, the impact of fire and the strength of the elephant-fire interaction increase; (2) at present population densities of 0.15 elephants/km(2), the total amount of woody cover is predicted to remain stable in the absence of fire, but the mature tree population is predicted to decline regardless of the fire regime; without grazers present to mitigate the effects of fire, the size structure of the tree population will become dominated by seedlings and mature trees; (3) spatial heterogeneity in tree cover varies unimodally with elephant population density fire increases heterogeneity in the presence of grazers and decreases it in their absence; (4) the marked rainfall gradient in the serengeti directly affects the pattern of tree cover in the absence of fire; with fire, the woody cover is determined by the grazing patterns of the migratory wildebeest, which are partly rainfall driven. our results show that, in open migratory ecosystems such as the serengeti, grazers can modulate the impact of fire and the strength of the interaction between fire and browsers by altering fuel loads and responding to the distribution of grass across the landscape, and thus exert strong effects on spatial patterns of tree cover.",62,2009,19,1,95,109,10.1890/07-1954.1,1,0,0,1"Fyllas, NM;

pregnancy rates declined by 50% and reproductive output fell by 82%. risk-disturbance overwhelmed any possible density-dependent effects of shooting in prairie dogs, which exhibited additive mortality in response to hunting, and reproductive failure 1 year after shooting. risk-disturbance was the predominant mechanism whereby individuals and colonies were affected by hunting. synthesis and applications. because of their coloniality, prairie dogs possess certain life-history traits that predisposed them to be particularly susceptible to hunting-associated disturbances, which had cascading effects on population-level processes. our findings contradict the general belief that small-bodied mammals quickly rebound from hunting exploitation via compensatory mortality and reproduction. managers should consider measures to reduce recreational shooting intensity and duration in regions where black-tailed prairie dog colony growth and persistence is desired, yet allow shooting in areas where colonies conflict with landowner interests.",18,2007,44,6,1219,1230,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01337.x,0,0,1,1"Morritt, D;

limpet; monsoon; physiology; rain; tropical shores,"although heat stress is often cited as the dominant physical stress on tropical shores, intertidal organisms in regions with monsoonal climates are also regularly exposed to prolonged periods of heavy rainfall. such events are predicted to have adverse physiological effects on individuals and may result in mortality. in a series of laboratory experiments, the impact of simulated monsoonal rains was investigated on the patellid limpet, cellana grata. sub-lethal responses in terms of body water content, body fluid osmolality and heart rate were measured in two different size cohorts maintained on horizontal and vertical substrata. limpets were unable to achieve any effective behavioural isolation, and exposure to either simulated rainfall or diluted seawater resulted in both large and small c grata gaining water with subsequent dilution of mantle water and haemolymph osmolalities. with increased duration of rainfall, dilution of body fluids increased with little difference between individuals on horizontal and vertical surfaces. body fluids generally showed proportional dilution during prolonged rain, but in some individuals there was evidence for regulation of the haemolymph relative to the mantle fluid. overall, smaller limpets were more susceptible to prolonged rainfall than large animals in terms of swelling of soft tissues and detachment and also had higher heart rates than large limpets. both cohorts reduced heart rates with prolonged rainfall, suggesting a degree of metabolic depression, especially on horizontal surfaces. in small limpets, no difference in heart rate was found with substratum orientation, whereas large limpets had elevated heart rates on vertical as compared to horizontal substrata, when exposed to either simulated rainfall or washed with dilute seawater. this may reflect the increased energetic costs required to maintain a relatively larger body on a vertical surface under stressful conditions. monsoonal rainfall during emersion, and subsequent dilution of seawater, therefore, have sub-lethal physiological and possible lethal effects on intertidal limpets. this influence has been largely overlooked, but coupled with the possible synergistic effects of thermal stress, monsoon rains are likely to play an important role in community dynamics on tropical shores.

positively to other non-native species, annual native grasses and perennial native sedges/rushes; and negatively to h. radicata when its cover was below 18%, but positively when above 18%. the degree of malleability reflected the high resilience of the vegetation to disturbance, and was mainly due to the recovery of perennial native grasses and h. radicata. this resilience demonstrated that the small-scale disturbances did not cause vegetation to cross an ecological threshold and that the present vegetation is resilient to common disturbances occurring at small scales. the results also suggest (1) that the present vegetation has developed mechanisms to adapt to these disturbances, (2) the importance of disturbance scale or (3) that the ecological threshold had already been crossed and the present vegetation is in a degraded state compared with its original state before the end of the 19th century.",5,2007,193,1,39,57,10.1007/s11258-006-9247-8,0,0,1,1"Ricklefs, RE;

(2) an evolutionarily stable state with pattern formation and metapopulation-like dynamics; and (3) rapid extinction of one or more species. interestingly, a weak relaxation of the obligacy between the plants and the pollinators erodes the evolutionarily stable state with pattern formation. we argue that this dependence upon and sensitivity to obligacy may explain the lack of empirical observations of endogenous pattern formation in nature.",0,2007,9,6,987,1004,,0,1,0,1"Reusch, TBH;

nitrogen supply, the three moss species responded strongly to treatment conditions. one of them suffered from nitrogen fertilisation and hence performed better in mixtures, where the dominant species provided physical shelter from apparently toxic nitrogen spray. accordingly, no linear competitive hierarchy emerged and qualitative transitivity remains restricted to the unfertilised treatments. faciliation also affected other properties of the competition structure. the reciprocity of competition effects could not be observed. moreover, the performances in three-species mixtures were not well predictable from the knowledge of monocultures and pairwise mixtures because competitive effects were not additive. this had implications for community stability at equilibrium: all two-species

experimentally examined how variations in moisture, temperature and herbivory by livestock affect post-1999 fire patterns of the three main tree species. over two years we monitored, in three forest types, the survival and growth of tree seedlings in a factorial warming (+2 degrees c)/livestock exclosure/watering experiment. 3. seedling survival in the warmed treatments and in the controls was nil for the evergreen nothofagus dombeyi and the conifer austrocedrus chilensis at the two low-elevation experimental sites. survival of the subalpine nothofagus pumilio in the warmed treatments at high elevation tended to be lower than in the control; for all treatments of warming alone there were no significant differences compared with the controls. 4. in all three forest types, increased water availability was essential for higher rates of tree seedling survival. doubling water availability during the growing season resulted in up to fourfold increases in seedling survival and up to threefold increases in seedling biomass. 5. in the subalpine forest, livestock reduced seedling survival by c. 30% in non-watered treatments compared with watered treatments, probably due mainly to soil desiccation and to consumption of or damage to facilitating plants. in contrast, at lower elevation, where livestock pressure was lower, seedling survival of n. dombeyi and a. chilensis tended to be higher in unfenced sites, possibly due to reduced competition from highly palatable shrub species. 6. general circulation models predict a warming-drying trend in northern patagonia during the twenty-first century. the resulting increase in wildfire is likely to be followed by inadequate tree regeneration and conversion from forest to shrubland cover types. this and similar studies suggest

forests. the leading cause of ruffed grouse mortality was avian predation (44% of known mortalities). harvest mortality accounted for 12% ofall known mortalities and appeared to be compensatory. population models indicated ruffed grouse populations in the appalachian region are declining (lambda = 0.7-0.95), but differences in model estimates highlighted the need for improved understanding of annual productivity and recruitment. we posit ruffed grouse in the appalachian region exhibit a clinal population structure characterized by changes in life-history strategies. changes in life history strategies are in response to gradual changes in forest structure, quality of food resources, snowfall and accumulation patterns, and predator communities. management efforts should focus on creating a mosaic of forest stand ages across the landscape to intersperse habitat resources including nesting and brood cover, adult escape cover, roosting sites, and, most importantly, food resources. land managers can intersperse habitat resources through a combination of clearcutting, shelterwood harvests, group selection, and timber stand improvement (including various thinnings and prescribed fire). managers should maintain current ruffed grouse harvest rates while providing high quality hunting opportunities. we define high quality hunting as low hunting pressure, low vehicle traffic, and high flush rates. managers ca provide high quality hunting opportunities through use of road closures in conjunction with habitat management.",10,2007,NA,168,1,36,10.2193/0084-0173.168,0,0,1,1"Elith, J;

Proceedings Paper,MARS; presence-only; multiresponse; habitat model; pseudo-absence; community,"current circumstances - that the majority of species distribution records exist as presence-only data (e.g. from museums and herbaria), and that there is an established need for predictions of species distributions - mean that scientists and conservation managers seek to develop robust methods for using these data. such methods must, in particular, accommodate the difficulties caused by lack of reliable information about sites where species are absent. here we test two approaches for overcoming these difficulties, analysing a range of data sets using the technique of multivariate adaptive regression splines (mars). mars is closely related to regression techniques such as generalized additive models (gams) that are commonly and successfully used in modelling species distributions, but has particular advantages in its analytical speed and the ease of transfer of analysis results to other computational environments such as a geographic information system. mars also has the advantage that it can model multiple responses, meaning that it can combine information from a set of species to determine the dominant environmental drivers of variation in species composition. we use data from 226 species from six regions of the world, and demonstrate the use of mars for distribution modelling using presence-only data. we test whether (1) the type of data used to represent absence or background and (2) the signal from multiple species affect predictive performance, by evaluating predictions at completely independent sites where genuine presence-absence data were recorded. models developed with absences inferred from the total set of presence-only sites for a biological group, and using simultaneous analysis of multiple species to inform the choice of predictor variables, performed better than models in which species were analysed singly, or in which pseudo-absences were drawn randomly from the study area. the methods are fast, relatively simple to understand, and useful for situations where data are limited. a tutorial is

the basal area of two life forms (conifers vs. broadleaf trees) along elevational gradients on yakushima island, japan and on two series of geological substrate on mount kinabalu, borneo. on yakushima, total stand basal area abruptly increased from 700 to 1,050 m in accordance with the high dominance of conifers, indicating the presence of additive basal area of conifers in conifer-broadleaf mixed forests at higher elevations (1,050-1,300 m). along two substrate series on kinabalu, some forests at higher elevations (1,860-3,080 m) showed relatively high dominance of conifers, but conifer basal area did not appear to be additive. conifers were emergents above the canopy of broadleaf trees in mixed forests on yakushima, but two life forms usually coexisted in the single-story canopy in mixed forests on kinabalu. litterfall rate as a surrogate of productivity decreased with decreasing temperature along elevation on both the sites, but the rate of decrease was slower on yakushima, where mixed forests at higher elevations showed relatively high rates. thus, we suggest that additive basal area of conifers was linked to their emergent status, and that it enhanced productivity by complementary use of light by two life forms that occupy different stories. on yakushima, typhoons are a major disturbance, but do not severely limit the height growth of conifers, allowing the development of two-story mixed forests. on kinabalu, a major disturbance is el nino-driven drought, and hydraulic limitation to tree height may explain the non-additive and

be disproportionately shared among communities relative to non-invasive non-native species. this effect is enhanced by human disturbance, as measured by the ratio of non-native to native species. there is a synergism between abundance and geographical range which enhances the homogenizing effects of abundant species. invasive species, with wide ecological niches, are more widely shared among communities and more locally abundant. abundant invasive species are thus more spatially homogenizing, and more ecologically dominant (functionally homogenizing). also, 'perceived homogenization' is probably greater than homogenization measured by the increase in shared species. the abundant species typically seen by the casual observer in a biological community are probably more commonly shared between communities than less common species. studies that lack abundance data and measure homogenization only on the basis of shared species, which includes most homogenization studies to date,

availability is the main factor determining vegetation patterns. on gypsum outcrops, vegetation is also conditioned by soil physical (i.e. surface crust) and chemical (i.e. ion unbalance) restrictions, which promote a highly specialist and endemic gypsophile flora. topographical and climatic variability affect the rigors of gypsum soil environment, and thus, plant community distribution along environmental gradients can differ between gypsum and non-gypsum substrates. the aim of the paper was to evaluate the relative importance of different abiotic factors as drivers of plant communities in gypsum and non-gypsum substrates. while non-gypsophile vegetation is expected to be determined mainly by aridity, gypsophile vegetation could show more. complex patterns, following the relaxation of the rigors of gypsum soil under environmental gradients such as steep slopes and mesic conditions. we compared the relationships between presence and cover of three plant communities (open woodland, dwarf-shrubland and garrigue) on gypsum and non-gypsum substrates with environmental factors, after removing the effect of human use. generalized additive models (gam) and generalized linear models (glm) were employed. results showed that xeric conditions inhibited development and recovery of vegetation, but plant communities on gypsum substrate did not always respond in the same way as non-gypsum vegetation. while the degree of aridity (determined by precipitation and temperature) conditioned non-gypsum vegetation strongly, favouring less developed plant communities, topographical factors (slope aspect and angle) were the main determinants of gypsum plant community patterns. we conclude that gypsum substrate determines strongly the plant community patterns in a semi-arid mediterranean landscape, as it can be observed by the strong response of gypsophile vegetation to the relaxation of the rigors of gypsum soils with topography (i.e. steep and

removal of sheep damage and summer drought from the model increased population growth by 51%. specialist herbivores and drought interacted synergistically to affect reproduction. 5. synthesis and applications. we show that vital rate elasticity analysis provides more management information than elasticity analysis on the level of matrix elements, particularly when management options affect only certain vital rates. for example, it can be used to make predictions about the effectiveness of predispersal floral herbivores in control management. the model can also help identify ways in which biocontrol can be augmented using integrated weed management that reduces seedling establishment probabilities, for example by preventing overgrazing. this method illustrates how native range studies of invasive species can be used to generate insights into managing populations in the invaded range.",31,2006,43,5,877,886,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01228.x,1,0,0,1"Benedick, S;

the location of the last remaining substantial population of ngwayir in jarrah forest. overall, ngwayir abundance was greatest in areas with limited anthropogenic disturbance. at the local-scale, ngwayir abundance was negatively associated with greater fire intensity. at the landscape-scale, it was positively associated with fox control and negatively associated with forest fragmentation and distance from non-remnant vegetation (i.e., agriculture and tree plantations). abundance was also greatest in predominantly unlogged landscapes and in forests that had been regrowing for an average of 40 years since the landscape was most recently logged, in other words, where logging was historically least intense. interactions between fox control efforts and forest fragmentation were also important. this study emphasises the importance of conducting research at appropriate spatial scales and to account for the synergistic effects of the causes of decline. an adaptive management approach to the mitigation of the agents of decline is recommended. indirect evidence indicates that high value habitat for ngwayir has in all likelihood been selectively cleared for agriculture, owing to its fertile and productive nature. habitat loss is, therefore, also likely to be a major cause of the modern decline of the species. while many jarrah forest areas that support remaining high abundances of the ngwayir have been incorporated into reserves, conservation of ngwayir habitat and populations outside reserves also will be essential for the recovery and long-term viability of the species.

fire history; landscape pattern; plant disease ecology; Phytophthora ramorum; spatial analysis,"fire can be a dominant process in the ecology of forest vegetation and can also affect forest disease dynamics. little is known about the relationship between fire and an emerging disease epidemic called sudden oak death, which is caused by a new pathogen, phytophthora ramorum. this disease has spread across a large, fire-prone portion of california, killing great numbers of oaks and tanoaks and infecting most associated woody plants. suitable hosts cover a much broader geographic range, raising concern over where the disease may spread. to understand the strength and potential sensitivities of a fire-disease relationship, we examined geographic patterns of confirmed p. ramorum infections in relation to past fire history. we found these infections to be extremely rare within the perimeter of any area burned since 1950. this finding is not caused by spatial bias in sampling for the disease, and is robust to variation in host abundance scenarios and to aggregation of closely spaced sampling locations. we therefore investigated known fire-related factors that could result in significantly lower incidence of the disease in relatively recently burned landscapes. chemical trends in post-fire environments can influence the success of pathogens like p. ramorum, either by increasing plant nutrient stress or by reducing the occurrence of chemicals antagonistic to phytophthoras. succession in the absence of fire leads to greater abundance of host species, which will provide increased habitat for p. ramorum; this will also increase intraspecific competition where these trees are abundant, and other density-dependent effects (e.g. shading) can reduce resource allocation to defenses. despite these findings about a fire-disease relationship, a much deeper understanding is necessary before fire can be actively used as a tool in slowing the epidemic.",14,2005,144,1,106,114,10.1007/s00442-005-0028-1,0,1,0,1"Oksanen, E;

these challenges include understanding the interactions of toxicants within an organism, identifying the mixtures that most commonly occur and cause adverse effects, and developing a regulatory structure capable of minimizing environmental impacts.",61,2004,9,6,,,,0,0,1,1"Stephenson, AG;

(2) inbred plants suffer greater herbivore damage and have more symptoms of viral infection than outbred plants, i.e., there is inbreeding depression for herbivore/pathogen resistance; (3) the impacts of insecticide applications and inbreeding on reproduction are mostly additive; (4) both male and female functions are significantly affected by the spray treatment and inbreeding; and (5) the adverse effects of both inbreeding and the increased exposure to herbivores/pathogens in the no-spray treatment are greater for female function than for male function, indicating that the impact of genetic and environmental stress can differentially affect the two sexual functions. together, these findings have important implications for the evolution of selfing, the conservation of small populations, and the establishment and transmission of diseases within populations.",53,2004,85,11,3023,3034,10.1890/04-0005,0,0,1,1"van Oers, K;

trait-mediated indirect effect; trichomes,"beetles in the genus tetraopes share a long evolutionary history with milkweeds (asclepias spp.), feeding on roots as larvae and leaves as adults. despite their extreme specialization on milkweed, tetraopes require drying grass stems as oviposition sites, even though they do not consume grass. the natural history of the interaction suggests that herbivory may be likely only when milkweeds are in close proximity to grasses. theory also predicts that two stresses on plants, competition and herbivory, may have non-additive negative impacts on correlates of fitness. in field experiments conducted over two years, i followed the consequences of grass competition and beetle attack for herbivory, growth, and reproduction of milkweed, and reciprocal effects of milkweed on grass in common gardens. to assess the effect of milkweed traits on beetles, i conducted a quantitative genetic experiment using full-sibling families of milkweed and measured the effects of putative resistance traits on the abundance of tetraopes adults. milkweeds growing next to grass were initially unaffected in growth but suffered 10% greater leaf herbivory by adult tetraopes than did milkweeds growing alone. this effect was caused by direct attraction of beetles to grass, not by a competitive modification of milkweed's phenotype. in late summer of the first growing season, when tetraopes naturally oviposits, i experimentally added larvae to milkweed roots with and without grass competition. within a month, i detected an interaction between competition and herbivory: neither had an individual impact, but jointly they reduced milkweed growth. in spring of the second growing season, when tetraopes had completed development, i again found strong evidence for a non-additive effect of competition and herbivory together, severely reducing plant growth compared to their individual effects. root herbivory induced a plant response that reduced the abundance of leaf-mining flies by 40%, but only for milkweeds with grass competition. neither competition nor herbivory affected the production of defensive latex, cardenolides, or carbon, but they interacted to affect leaf nitrogen content. thus, although trait-mediated indirect interactions were implicated in the effect of competition and root herbivory on leaf miner abundance, i did not uncover the mechanism. in the final harvest, beetle herbivory reduced reproductive characters (fruit production, fruit mass, aboveground biomass) by 20-30%, whereas competition had negligible effects. the net interaction effect for grass was competitive, with a 23% reduction in grass biomass caused by milkweed in the absence of herbivory. however, the presence of beetle herbivory on milkweed roots completely alleviated the competitive effect of milkweed on grass. thus, the associational effect of grass on milkweed resulted in milkweed suffering the non-additive effects of competition and herbivory, whereas grass enjoyed competitive release by facilitating its neighbor's herbivore. many traits of milkweed (e.g., growth, reproduction, and several resistance traits) showed variation among 23 full-sibling families, indicating that competitive ability and resistance may be subject to natural selection. a multiple regression analysis on family means revealed that leaf trichome density and nitrogen content were negatively genetically correlated with abundance of tetraopes adults, but probability of flowering and plant height were positively associated. leaf miners were most strongly negatively affected by latex and trichomes. thus, complex interactions among competition, root herbivory, and plant genetic variation affect the herbivore and plant community and may result in diffuse co-evolution between milkweed and its herbivores. i present a general model that predicts the conditions in which plant-plant interactions result in net competition or facilitation.",80,2004,85,8,2118,2133,10.1890/03-4084,0,0,1,1"Seal, AN;

and emphasises the need to situate the analysis in its context. in particular, it stresses the need to involve the potential users, as well as to take into account the planned use of the analysis and the interactions between different levels of analysis and decision-making. capabilities and social capital can both be useful in structuring thoughts, but are not as such directly applicable as suitable analytical frameworks. in particular, they do not provide adequate tools for examining the social preconditions for institutional change needed for environmentally sustainable development.

salicylic acid; tomato,"one goal of phytohormonal ecology is to study the interactions between biotic and abiotic stress at hierarchical levels of biological organization. from an ecological perspective, exposure to one stress may alter the plant's probability of being exposed to another stress. from a mechanistic perspective, hormonal and biochemical signaling interactions between responses to each stress may influence the severity or ability to adaptively respond to the subsequent stress. in this article, we consider the relationship between plant water and salt stress and attack by pathogens and herbivores. empirical data suggest that water stress and the probability of attack by pathogens and herbivores are correlated between habitats. biochemical interactions between plant responses to water and salt stress and insect. and pathogen attack are also interrelated. initial biochemical models indicated that abscisic acid (aba), an important hormone in responses to water and salt stress, had a synergistic positive role with jasmonate-induced defenses against herbivores and an,antagonistic role with salicylate-based resistance to some pathogens. based on this background, we developed predictions about how water and salt stress would alter plant resistance to insects and pathogens and tested the predictions using tomato plants as a model system. we: used polyphenol oxidase activity as a marker of the jasmonate response and, pathogenesis-related protein p4 as a marker of the salicylate response. first, we examined levels of chemical defense in wild-type and aba-deficient plants and the ability of these plants to resist insect and pathogen attack. in the second experiment, we exposed plants to short-term salinity stress and tested their subsequent resistance to a chewing. insect spodoptera exigua and the bacterial speck pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. we have two key findings. first, aba-deficient plants had higher levels of salicylate-mediated responses and were more resistant to bacterial speck disease, consistent with the proposed role of salicylate in defense against pathogens. this suggests linkage between water availability to the plant and salicylate action in pathogenesis through aba signaling. aba-deficient plants had reduced resistance to the insect spodoptera exigua, suggesting a positive correlation between responses to water stress and herbivory. the lack of difference in chemical expression of the jasmonate (ja) response (polyphenol oxidase activity) between wild-type and aba-deficient plants did not support the proposed mechanism of synergism with the jasmonate response. second, salt stress reduced the chemical induction, (e.g., pathogenesis-related protein p4) of the salicylate response, but this did not affect resistance to the pathogen. salt stress did not alter resistance to the herbivore trichoplusia ni, but did alter the negative signal interaction between the jasmonate and salicylate responses. under control conditions, the jasmonate and salicylate responses are antagonistic to one another, with induction of one response reducing the inducibility of the other. under salt stress conditions, the negative effect of salicylate on the jasmonate response was reduced. thus, complex interactions occur between. aba, ja, and sa, hormones that are important regulators of abiotic and biotic stress responses. phytohormonal ecology is attempting to link ecological and hormonal interactions to develop a predictive framework for how and why plants coordinate responses to the environment.",107,2004,85,1,48,58,10.1890/02-0710,1,1,0,2"Jankovsky, L;

density dependence; life tables; pyrethroids; resource limitation,"1. chemical effects on organisms are typically assessed using individual-level endpoints or sometimes population growth rate (pgr), but such measurements are generally made at low population densities. in contrast most natural populations are subject to density dependence and fluctuate around the environmental carrying capacity as a result of individual competition for resources. as ecotoxicology aims to make reliable population projections of chemical impacts in the field, an understanding of how high-density or resource-limited populations respond to environmental chemicals is essential. 2. our objective was to determine the joint effects of population density and chemical stress on the life history and pgr of an important ecotoxicological indicator species, chironomus riparius, under controlled laboratory conditions. populations were fed the same ration but initiated at different densities and exposed to a solvent control and three concentrations of c-14-cypermethrin in a sediment-water test system for 67 days at 20 +/- 1 degreesc. 3. density had a negative effect on all the measured life-history traits, and pgr declined with increasing density in the controls. exposure to c-14-cypermethrin had a direct negative effect on juvenile survival, presumably within the first 24 h because the chemical rapidly dissipated from the water column. reductions in the initial larval densities resulted in an increase in the available resources for the survivors. subsequently, exposed populations emerged sooner and started producing offspring earlier than the controls. c-14-cypermethrin had no effect on estimated fecundity and adult body weight but interacted with density to reduce the time to first emergence and first reproduction. as a result, pgr increased with cypermethrin concentration when populations were initiated at high densities. 4. synthesis and applications. the results showed that the effects of c-14-cypermethrin were buffered at high density, so that the joint effects of density and chemical stress on pgr were less than additive. low levels of chemical stressors may increase carrying capacity by reducing juvenile competition for resources. more and perhaps fitter adults may be produced, similar to the effects of predators and culling; however, toxicant exposure may result in survivors that are less tolerant to changing conditions. if less than additive effects are typical in the field, standard regulatory tests carried out at low density may overestimate the effects of environmental chemicals. further studies over a wide range of chemical stressors and organisms with contrasting life histories are needed to make general recommendations.",21,2003,40,6,1049,1059,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2003.00858.x,0,0,1,1"Ervin, DE;

environmental; ecological; systems; research,"a review of current research shows insufficient monitoring and testing have been conducted to reliably assess the degree of environmental risks posed by transgenic crops. the major risks include increased resistance to particular pesticides, gene flow into related plant species, and negative effects on non-target organisms. significant gaps in knowledge, often stemming from missing markets for ecological services, warrant a cautious environmental regulatory approach for transgenic crops. the objective of this paper is to identify the types of ecological systems public research to implement effective biosafety controls. us biosafety regulatory processes tend to focus on controlling type i error, i.e. restricting the release of the crops when significant environmental risks do not exist, because the economic losses from denying commercialization can be estimated. however, the precautionary principle, which focuses on controlling type ii errors, i.e. releasing the crops when serious ecosystem damage will occur, adds a necessary criterion given the current deficit in ecological science. the key challenge facing regulators is to find the appropriate balance of controlling type i versus type ii errors. the research program should embed the lessons of evolutionary biology and ecological sciences. viewing the plant as a production machine that can be ""brute-force"" reengineered for more efficiency is a poor analogy. unanticipated and unintended results, positive and negative, will emerge from such engineering because plants are complex systems embedded in poorly understood, complex, and interacting ecosystems. an ideal public research program should capture the interconnectedness of ecological systems, the essential roles of ecosystem services, nonlinear and threshold responses to accumulating stresses, and global expansion of the technology. basic elements of such a program include long-term studies of cumulative and synergistic pesticide resistance effects, potential gene flow problems for those transgenic crop trait-weed complexes with high probabilities of outcrossing and ecological disruption, and scientific protocols for assessing deleterious effects on non-target organisms. for all three effects, expanded ecosystem monitoring of the commercialized crops in varied settings is needed for improved type ii error definitions and estimates. the development of improved risk analysis methodologies and protocols should also be a priority. finally, scientific effort to stimulate precautionary research, such as the development of transgenic crops that mimic ecological systems functioning, could avert many risks. creating information to avoid significant ecological damages and foster precautionary research and development for transgenic crops are neglected roles of public biotechnology research.

similarly, lps injection induced a dramatic drop in feeding rate and reproductive success of breeding females. however, this reduction depended on brood size, suggesting that the strength of the trade-off between immune activation and reproduction was affected by the workload required to feed the brood. overall, this study stresses the magnitude of costs associated with mounting immune responses and the ecological and evolutionary consequences for natural populations.",252,2003,161,3,367,379,10.1086/346134,0,1,0,1"Phelan, JP;

(z)-jasmone was identified as a plant-derived semiochemical acting negatively for a number of aphid species, and positively for insect antagonists such as parasitoids and predators. however, when the compound was employed at 0.1 ppm in air above intact plants, these plants then attracted aphid parasitoids long after the (z)-jasmone itself was no longer detectable, a specific interaction was proposed. since the (z)-jasmone appeared to be selectively taken up by the plants. aerial interactions between intact barley plants from different cultivars, which may be differentially releasing stress associated signals, can also influence acceptability to aphids. furthermore, it has been shown that exudates from the roots of aphid-infested plants, grown hydroponically or in soil, cause intact plants to become more attractive to parasitoids.

freshwater management; groundwater; hydrologic connections; national forests; national parks; national wildlife refuges; surface water; US public lands; water diversions,"u.s. public lands are increasingly threatened by human alteration of hydrologic connections outside their boundaries. cumulative effects of dams, impoundments, regulated flows, wetlands drainage, and groundwater extraction outside of public land boundaries can play a key role in controlling the hydrology and biology within these managed areas. expanding human populations require more water, and they often look to public lands to meet their demands. immediate challenges facing water resource managers are increased pressure to dam rivers and pump aquifers near public lands, as a result of water shortages exacerbated by droughts coupled with increased demands from municipal and agricultural growth. as pollutants become more concentrated in less water, water quality often becomes a major related issue. while these problems are particularly acute in rapidly growing regions of the arid west where water is severely limited, they are also emerging in the east. data on cumulative effects of hydrologic alterations on the biological integrity of public lands have not been systematically assessed at a national level. however, emerging trends can be used to gauge the magnitude of outside pressures and to place water resource challenges into context. the u.s. national park service is participating in water rights adjudications in over 50 different park service units. the u.s. forest service currently has over 500 legal claims concerning water rights for national forests located in 55 basins of 11 western states. similar conflicts exist for national wildlife refuges which are particularly vulnerable to water quality and quantity problems because of their small size; in 1994, 150 out of 224 western wildlife refuges reported conflicts with other water users, and only 98 reported that their existing water rights assured delivery of adequate water in an average year. as human demands for water continue to expand, financially strapped federal land management agencies have a greater need for strengthened institutional, legal, and scientific tools to manage hydrologic connections. two case studies from different biogeographic extremes (stillwater national wildlife refuge in the arid nevada desert and the caribbean national forest in the wet tropics of puerto rico) illustrate the synergism that can occur between field managers and scientists in implementing localized solutions. moreover, they highlight the critical need to address cumulative long-term effects of hydrologic alterations outside of public land boundaries. recommendations include: establishment of more stream gaging stations and monitoring programs within and adjacent to public lands;

vitality-related mortality occurs when the random process reaches the boundary of zero vitality. the age at which vitality-related mortality occurs is represented by the weiner-process probability distribution for first-arrival time. the basic model has three rate parameters: the rate of accidental mortality, the mean rate of vitality loss, and the variability in the rate of vitality loss. these rates are related to body mass, environmental conditions, and xenobiotic stressors, resulting in a model that characterizes intrinsic and extrinsic factors that control a population's survival and the distribution of vitality of its individuals. the model assumes that these factors contribute to the rate parameters additively and linearly. the model is evaluated with case studies across a range of species exposed to natural and xenobiotic stressors. the mean rate of vitality loss generally is the dominant factor in determining the shape of survival curves under optimal conditions. xenobiotic stressors add to the mean rate in proportion to the strength of the stressor. the base, or intrinsic, vitality loss rate is proportional to the - 1/3 power of adult body mass across a range of iteroparous species. the increase in vitality loss rate with a xenobiotic stressor can be a function of body mass according to the allometric relationship of the organism structures affected by the stressor. the model's applicability to dose-response studies is illustrated with case studies including natural stressors (temperature, feeding interval, and population density) and xenobiotic stressors (organic and inorganic toxicants). the model provides a way to extrapolate the impact of stressors measured in one environment to another environment;

some within-species variation could be due to genetic differences between individuals. 2. in order to demonstrate additive genetic variation in aphid tolerance, a breeding programme was carried out where offspring of field-collected females of the linyphiid spider lepthyphantes tenuis were selected for survival on a pure diet of the aphid rhopalosiphum padi through the first juvenile instar. aphid tolerance was estimated as the survival in proportion to survival of a control line, fed mixed collembola. development and reproduction were recorded in order to detect possible selection effects. 3. after only one generation of selection, survival to the first moult on an aphid diet was significantly improved. the aphid tolerance of the first instar spiderlings increased by 63% and a high heritability for the trait was found. an f-2 control group derived from selected parents had significantly reduced survival compared with an f-2 control group derived from control parents. 4. developmental rate and reproduction were lower in the selected group than in the control line, demonstrating a cost of tolerance to aphids. 5. the background of the genetic variation and its possible implications for the natural limitation of aphid populations in agricultural systems is discussed. consideration of the control potential of polyphagous predators must include their genetic variation in aphid tolerance. management practices aimed at augmenting specialist aphid predators, e.g. by erecting banks or cover crops containing non-pest aphids, may provide selection pressure for increased aphid tolerance in polyphagous predators.",17,2000,37,4,547,556,10.1046/j.1365-2664.2000.00514.x,0,0,1,1"Duarte, CM",marine biodiversity and ecosystem services: an elusive link,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,Article,seagrass;

particularly, if highly mutated individuals suffer more when infected than do less mutated individuals, this, suggests that pathogens and mutations act synergistically. pseudomonas-infected individuals were shown to have an increased probability of flowering under-conditions of short day length, but to ultimately produce fewer flowers than uninfected individuals. this suggests a plastic response to stress and, despite that response, an ultimately deleterious effect of infection on fitness. leaf rosette growth was negatively and linearly related to the expected number of mutations, and the effects of mutation on different life-cycle stages appeared to be uncorrelated. no significant interactions between pathogen and mutation main effects were found. these results suggest that mutations act multiplicatively with each other and with pathogen infection in determining individual fitness.",15,1999,12,3,460,470,,1,0,1,2"Mitchell, RJ;

however, only liquidambar affected andropogon, and only andropogon affected seasonal water available to liquidambar. light was most strongly influenced by liquidambar density; however, as andropogon density increased, the effects of liquidambar were reduced. andropogon response was correlated with light but not with water stress or leaf nitrogen. this reflects high light requirements and high water use efficiency of c-4 plants. liquidambar response was related to water stress and leaf nitrogen, perhaps reflecting the greater nitrogen requirements of hardwoods. pinus response was significantly related to all three resources individually, i.e., water stress, light, and leaf nitrogen. pinus response was better explained by a regression model that included light and water stress than by water stress or light alone. pinus growth as a function of water stress and light indicated that communities dominated by liquidambar largely reduced pinus growth through reduction in light, while communities dominated by andropogon reduced pinus growth primarily by increasing water stress. in mixed communities of liquidambar and andropogon, pine growth was constrained more equally by light and water stress.",39,1999,80,3,857,872,10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[0857:CASSPC]2.0.CO;2,0,0,1,1"Whitham, TG;

genetic basis of community structure; genetic diversity; indirect effects; keystone species; plant hybrid zones; specialists and generalists,"plant hybrid zones are dynamic centers of ecological and evolutionary processes for plants and their associated communities. studies in the wild and in gardens with synthetic crosses showed that hybrid eucalypts supported the greatest species richness and abundances of insect and fungal taxa. in an updated review of 152 case studies of taxa associated with diverse hybridizing systems, there were 43 (28%) cases of hybrids being more susceptible than their parent species, 7 (5%) resistant, 35 (23%) additive, 35 (23%) dominant, and 32 (21%) showed no response to hybridization. thus, most taxa respond to hybrids in ways that result in equal or greater abundance, and hybrids tend to accumulate the taxa of their parent species. these studies suggest that genetic-based plant traits affect the distribution of many species and that the variation in hybrids can be used as tools to examine the genetic components of community structure and biodiversity. several patterns have emerged thus far. (1) genetic variation between classes of hybrids (e.g., f(1)'s vs. backcrosses) may equal or even exceed that found between species. (2) as a reflection of this genetic variation, herbivores are more likely to differentiate between hybrid classes than they are to differentiate between pure plant species. (3) the communities associated with different hybrid classes can differ from one another as well as from their parental species. (4) generalist and specialist herbivores predictably vary in their responses to hybrids. (5) plant hybrid zones may represent essential habitat for some arthropod species. (6) even nesting birds respond to hybridizing plants. (7) including multiple trophic levels and taxa from microbes to vertebrates, susceptible hybrid genotypes support greater biodiversity than resistant genotypes. (8) the effects of hybridization on common or keystone species can either positively or negatively affect biodiversity. the indirect impacts of hybridization on biodiversity may exceed the direct impacts and may result in ""apparent"" herbivore resistance or susceptibility at the community level. (9) although hybrids are often maligned, exotic or problem hybrids generally result from human disturbances, whereas native hybrids are part of natural ecosystems and should be conserved. three predictions are made: (1) intermediate genetic differences between the parental species will result in the greatest genetic variation in the hybrid zone, which in turn will have a positive effect on biodiversity. (2) bidirectional introgression enhances species richness on hybrids, whereas f(1) sterility and unidirectional introgression limit the accumulation of species on hybrids.

richness was correlated with decadence and canopy stratification. major dietary fungi were associated with woody debris. flying squirrels had higher carrying capacities and overlap among foraging patches of individuals, but smaller foraging patches, in late seral forest than in managed stands. squirrels were more abundant in late seral forest than in managed forests. abundance in some stands deviated markedly from the stage mean-stand character was more influential than nominal seral stage. the 4 structural factors each represented all important ecological process; decadence and canopy stratification apparently had profound influences on other life forms. carefully timed variable-density thinnings could accelerate crown-class differentiation, canopy stratification, and understory development and increase habitat breadth. management of decadence is more problematic and may require various interventions, in eluding inducing decay in live trees, conserving biological legacies from previous stands, and ensuring recruitment of coarse woody debris.",7,1999,NA,142,5,71,,1,0,0,1"Paine, RT;

high root-zone and atmospheric moisture, and rhyolitic and quaternary substrates, particularly where drainage was impeded. highest nothofagus diversity was predicted for sites combining low temperatures, high solar radiation, high root-zone moisture but low atmospheric moisture, and on granitic substrates. differences in diversity between the species groups on different lithologies are interpreted as reflecting both the effects of variation in large-scale disturbance histories, and the effects of confounding environmental factors associated with particular substrates. there were also significant interactions between species groups: both broadleaved tree and conifer richness were predicted to be lower on sites where one or more nothofagus spp. - all of which have marked patchiness in their distribution - are present. although these results are consistent with the hypothesis that tree diversity is highest on sites conducive to high productivity, history is also indicated as an important determinant of tree diversity in new zealand.",58,1998,21,3,235,246,10.1111/j.1600-0587.1998.tb00561.x,0,0,1,1"Puigdefabregas, J;

their vulnerability to rainfall variability; the difficulties of relieving them from overexploitation of water resources; and their terminal symptoms, such as soil salinization, exhaustion and deterioration of aquifers, and damage to downstream fluvial and wetland systems.

japan are noted, as european forests are suffering. however, they may be linked with different causes: forest succession dynamics, diseases and pests, meteorological extreme conditions, air pollutants, acidic deposition, and so on. exposure experiments have been conducted to assess cause-effects relationships with acidic deposition and forest decline. simulated acid rain or ozone in combination with sulfur dioxide was exposed to sixteen potted-tree species for 3 growing seasons. rain acidity below ph 4.0 could induce deleterious effects on some broad-leaved trees, however, coniferous trees did not show any significant growth reduction. sulfur dioxide and/or ozone induced complicated differential growth responses than the wet deposition did. some indicated additive harmful effects of sulfur dioxide. others showed synergistic adverse effects of ozone and sulfur dioxide. experimental results suggest that ambient level of ozone may take an important role to reduce tree vitality, since ozone induced chronic changes in carbon allocation will be accelerated by increased nitrogen input. assuming that fossil fuel energy consumption will continue at the current rate in the china, sulfur emission will be double at the year of 2010. without any countermeasures for reduction of sulfur dioxide emission, it may induce possible adverse direct effects on the natural vegetation due to increasing concentration of sulfur dioxide rather than due to increasing wet deposition of sulfate. exposure experiments suggest that differential sensitivity of plants to primary

responses of organisms exposed to combinations of chemical and physical stressors. although antagonistic, additive and synergistic effects have been described for exposure of biota to combinations of chemical stressors, it seems to be agreed that concentration addition proves to be a reasonable worst case estimation. therefore, aggregation of physico-chemical parameters in water quality indices

stressors, basic data are often lacking or inadequate to allow precise predictions of the cumulative impacts of multiple stressors at the ecosystem level. even in the long term, investigation of all

management on the composition of short-tussock grasslands and the abundance of the invasive weed hieracium pilosella were investigated in two small catchments. species composition and site factors were recorded on a total of 182 plots and the management history of each catchment was reviewed. h. pilosella was present on >80% of all plots, but was at an early stage of invasion in one catchment (<5% cover) and dominant in the other (25% cover). classification and ordination revealed strong between-catchment differences in community composition that reflected differences in environment (soil fertility and rainfall), disturbance history (animal populations and burning), and the stage of invasion by h. pilosella. in both catchments h. pilosella tended to be least abundant on the wettest, driest, and most fertile soils. however, such relationships were weak. generalised additive models and regression showed that in the earlier stage of invasion individual site factors explained less than 20% of the variation in h. pilosella cover. topographic position and slope (both indicative of soil moisture) were the most significant combined predictors, but together explained only 32% of the variation. in the later stage of invasion individual factors explained up to 33% of the variation. topsoil sulphur, slope, and topsoil calcium were the most significant combined predictors, but together explained only 53% of the variation. between-catchment comparisons highlighted the inter-related roles of environment, disturbance history, geographic location, availability of h. pilosella propagules, and stage of invasion in more fully explaining the abundance of h. pilosella. of five models that have been proposed for hieracium invasion, the: ""grassland decline"" model best incorporated the inter-related factors that influence spatial and temporal variation in h. pilosella abundance in the study area. this model concentrates on identifying predisposing and trigger factors that increase the likelihood of invasion and accounts for multiple causes and interactions by specifying five key factors that influence the ability of a plant species to invade existing vegetation: environment, disturbance, vegetation structure and composition, life history attributes of the invader, and the availability of invading propagules. the model potentially provides a

J",evaluating the impacts of logging activities on erosion and suspended sediment transport in the caspar creek watersheds,PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONFERENCE ON COASTAL WATERSHEDS: THE CASPAR CREEK STORY,Proceedings Paper,,"suspended sediment has been sampled at both the north and south fork weirs of caspar creek in northwestern california since 1963, and at 13 tributary locations in the north fork since 1986. the north fork gaging station (nfc) was used as a control to evaluate the effects of logging in the south fork, in the 1970's, on annual sediment loads. in the most conservative treatment of the data, suspended loans increased by 212 percent over the total predicted for a 6-yr period commencing with the onset of logging. when the roles of the watersheds were preserved and the same analysis repeated to evaluate harvesting in the north fork under california forest practice rules in the 1990's, no significant increase was found at nfc in either annual suspended or bed load with the am,ent of automatic pumping samplers, we were able to sample sediment concentration much more frequently in the 1980's. this allowed storm event loads from control watersheds in the north fork to be used in a new regression analysis for nfc. according to this more sensitive analysis, for the 7-yr period commencing with the onset of logging, the sum of the suspended storm loads at nfc was 89 percent higher than that predicted for the undisturbed condition. the much greater increase after logging in the south fork is too great to be explained by differences in sampling methods and in water years, and appears to be the result of differences in roan alignment, yarding methods, and stream protection zones. similar analyses of storm event loads for each of the treated subwatersheds in the north fork suggested increased suspended loans in all but one of the tributaries, but effects were relatively small or absent at the main stern locations. of watersheds with less than 50 percent cut, only one showed a highly significant increase. the greater increase in sediment at nfc, compared to other main-stem stations, is largely explained by a 3,600-m(3) landslide that occurred in 1995 in a subwatershed that drains into the main stem just above nfc. differences among tributary responses can be explained in terms of channel conditions. analysis of an aggregated model simultaneously fit to all of the data shows that sediment load increases are correlated with flow increases after lagging. field evidence suggests that the increased flows, accompanied by soil disruption and intense burning, accelerated erosion of unbuffered stream banks and channel headward expansion. windthrow along buffered streams also appears to be important as a source of both woody debris and sediment. all roads in the north fork are located on upper slopes and do not appear to be a significant source of sediment reaching the channels. the aggregated model permitted evaluation of certain types of cumulative effects. effects of multiple disturbances on suspended loans were approximately additive and, with one exception, downstream changes were no greater than would hare been expected from the proportion of area disturbed. a tendency for main-stem channels to yield higher unit-area suspended loads was also detected but after logging this was no longer the case in the north

similar species. by examining both the costs and the benefits, we show that harshness alone does not lessen the importance of species interactions or limit their role in community structure. species coexistence requires niche differences, and harshness does not in itself make coexistence more likely. fluctuations in environmental conditions (e.g., disturbance, seasonal change, and weather variation) also have been regarded as decreasing species interactions and favoring coexistence, but we argue that coexistence can only be favored when fluctuations create spatial or temporal niche opportunities. we argue that important diversity-promoting roles for harsh and fluctuating conditions depend on deviations from the assumptions of additive effects and linear dependencies most

disturbance regimes. the primary consequence of agriculture, wildfires, and extensive fires ignited by the military during training activities was loss of native shrubs from the landscape. agriculture created large square blocks on the landscape, and the landscape contained fewer small patches and more large shrub patches than non-agricultural areas. in contrast, fires left a more fragmented landscape. repeated fires did not change the distribution of patch sizes, but decreased the total area of remaining shrublands and increased the distance between remaining shrub patches that provide seed sources. military training with tracked vehicles was associated with a landscape characterized by small, closely spaced, shrub patches. our results support the general model hypothesized for conversion of shrublands to annual grasslands by disturbance. larger shrub patches in our region, historically resistant to fire spread and large-scale fires because of a perennial bunchgrass understory, were more fragmented than small patches. presence of cheatgrass (bromus tectorum), an exotic annual, was positively related to landscape patchiness and negatively related to number of shrub cells. thus, cheatgrass dominance can contribute to further fragmentation and loss of the shrub patch by facilitating spread of subsequent fires, carried by continuous fuels, through the patch. the synergistic processes of fragmentation of shrub patches by disturbance, invasion and subsequent dominance by exotic annuals, and fire are converting shrubsteppe in southwestern idaho to a new

fitness, this partial change is obtained by replacing the actual genotypic fitnesses by the corresponding additive genetic values and by keeping these values fixed in the change of the mean with

both survival and growth of the grasshopper melanoplus sanguinipes and growth of the leaf beetle trirhabda pilosa were higher on hybrid shrubs than on either parent. because many secondary compounds have been determined to occur at intermediate concentrations in f-2 shrubs, dominance for susceptibility may indicate that insects respond to plant traits (e.g., oviposition stimulants and deterrents) in a threshold manner. mechanisms underlying increased hybrid susceptibility are less clear, but our experimental design makes environmental explanations (e.g., the plant-stress hypothesis) unlikely. although we eliminated several confounding factors, our results agree with the conclusion from natural hybrid zones that insect responses to hybrid plants are likely to be idiosyncratic;

flow refugia; harsh-benign hypothesis; heterogeneity; predation,"the effects of hydraulic disturbances on the impact of two predatory benthic invertebrates on their prey were examined in a stream at two distinct spatial scales. at the scale of small habitat patches (0.0625 m(2)), hydraulic patch type was an important determinant of the microdistribution of prey and predators. prey abundances were similar across all patch types at baseflow, but local densities were higher in patches identified as low-flow refugia after periods of high and fluctuating flow. the microdistribution pattern of predatory larvae of a caddisfly, plectrocnemia conspersa, was similar to that of its prey, whereas predatory larvae of an alderfly, sialis fuliginosa, did not shift their microdistribution significantly with discharge and were always most abundant in low-flow refugia. there was little evidence of an aggregative response of predators with prey, even though both predators and prey are mobile. both predator species showed similar patch-specific patterns of per capita consumption rates: uniform consumption-rates across hydraulic patch types at low and moderate flows, but highest in flow refugia during high flows. species-specific patterns, however, were apparent in the magnitude and direction of differences between consumption rates during disturbance events, and in comparable patches at base flow: at high flow, consumption rates for p. conspersa were exaggerated (3.9 times higher) in flow refugia but ''at par'' in other patches; for s. fuliginosa they were ''at par'' in flow refugia but reduced in other patches (up to 3.3. times lower). these differences may be related to species-specific foraging behaviours (search vs ambush predators) and the influence of prey movements on feeding success. using the patch-scale results only, it is difficult to predict the effects of physical disturbance on predation intensity at the larger scales of whole habitats, populations or communities. at the large scale (>200 m(2)), net predator impacts were estimated over the stream reach, using a spatially explicit model that accounts, in an additive way, for habitat heterogeneity and patch-specific responses of predators and prey. the relationship between predator impact over the whole reach and hydraulic disturbance differed for the two predators. the predator impact of s. fuliginosa decreased with increasing hydraulic disturbance, as predicted by the harsh-benign hypothesis. there was no directional trend for p. conspersa, however, and maximum predator impact may occur at intermediate disturbance levels. for the prey community in this stream, predation pressure from s. fuliginosa appears to fluctuate directly with the discharge hydrograph, whereas predation from p. conspersa may be more persistent. flow refugia may play a dual role in the sructure of stream communities by preventing catastrophic mortality of animals (predators and prey) from physical forces during disturbances, and by maintaining (or perhaps increasing) predation pressure. summing the effects of species interactions in small habitat patches to the larger scale of a whole stream reach indicates that the scale of approach influences the observed patterns and their implied underlying process.",55,1996,107,3,321,331,10.1007/BF00328448,0,0,1,1"Hoft, M;

REPRODUCTIVE VALUE,"the purpose of this study was to identify and quantify the demographic and genetic factors that favor long-term persistence of resident bird populations on small islands. two species of darwin's ground finches, geospiza scandens (cactus finch) and g. fortis (medium ground finch), were studied on isla daphne major, galapagos, from 1975 to 1991. four cohorts born in the years 1975-1978 were followed to the point where almost every individual had died. life tables were constructed from survival and reproductive data, and used to calculate genetically effective population sizes. annual rainfall was highly variable and erratic. extremes were 0 and 1359 mm. as a consequence the finch populations fluctuated in all demographic parameters. in years of little or no rainfall breeding did not occur, in years of abundant rainfall as many as eight breeding attempts were made by individual pairs. maximum ages were 15 yr for g. scandens and 14 yr for g. fortis. males of both species tended to live longer than females and to breed later; most females bred for the first time at ages 1-3 yr, whereas most males bred for the first time at ages 2-6 yr. an unusual feature of the survival and reproductive schedules is an increase in reproductive value sometimes occurring moderately late in life more than once, associated with occasional extremely favorable conditions for reproduction. harmonic mean breeding population sizes (nbar) were 94 g. scandens and 197 g. fortis. effective population sizes (n(e)) were much lower, principally as a result of a large variance in the production of recruits per parent, especially by g. fortis. average effective sizes were 38 g. scandens and 60 g. fortis by one method of calculation, and slightly larger by another. the proportional rate of loss of selectively neutral heterozygosity or additive genetic variance in quantitative traits potentially caused by random genetic drift (1/2n(e)) in these populations is approximately 0.003-0.005, or 0.3-0.5%/yr, and between 0.8 and 1.4% per generation. we suggest that a general estimate for the effective size of terrestrial bird populations is about one-quarter of average breeding numbers. these results are discussed in relation to the long-term viability of the populations and the maintenance of genetic variation. the demographic features that enable the finch species to persist in the face of extreme environmental stochasticity are a high maximum life-span, a generally high adult survival under the stressful conditions of drought, a flexible period of maturity, and a high reproductive rate. despite their relatively small effective population sizes and the likelihood of genetic impoverishment through random drift they remain genetically variable through gene flow, principally hybridization. this study highlights fluctuating (unstable) age structures as a methodological constraint on some of the theoretical calculations. an expanded demographic and population-genetic theory is needed to overcome this constraint.",67,1992,73,3,766,784,10.2307/1940156,0,0,1,1"HENLEY, WJ;
