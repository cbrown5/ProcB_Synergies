critical transitions; drought stress; early warning signals; forest decline; generalized additive mixed models; mortality; plant-climate interactions; tree death,"1. some disturbances can drive ecological systems to abrupt shifts between alternative stages (tipping points) when critical transitions occur. drought-induced tree death can be considered as a nonlinear shift in tree vigour and growth. however, at what point do trees become predisposed to drought-related dieback and which factors determine this (tipping) point? we investigated these questions by characterizing the responses of three tree species, silver fir (abies alba), scots pine (pinus sylvestris) and aleppo pine (pinus halepensis), to a severe drought event. 2. we compared basal area increment (bai) trends and responses to climate and drought in declining (very defoliated and dying) vs. non-declining (slightly or not defoliated) trees by using generalized additive mixed models. defoliation, bai and sapwood production were related to functional proxies of tree vigour measured at the onset and end of the drought (non-structural carbohydrate concentrations, needle n content and c isotopic discrimination, presence of wood-inhabiting fungi). we evaluated whether early warning signals (increases in synchronicity among trees or in autocorrelation and standard deviation) could be extracted from the bai series prior to tree death. 3. declining silver fir and scots pine trees showed less growth than non-declining trees one to three decades, respectively, before the drought event, whereas aleppo pines showed growth decline irrespective of tree defoliation. at the end of the drought period, all species showed increased defoliation and a related reduction in the concentration of sapwood soluble sugars. defoliation was constrained by the bai of the previous 5 years and sapwood production. no specific wood-inhabiting fungi were found in post-drought declining trees apart from blue-stain fungi, which extensively affected damaged scots pines. declining silver firs showed increases in bai autocorrelation and variability prior to tree death. 4. synthesis. early warning signals of drought-triggered mortality seem to be species specific and reflect how different tree species cope with drought stress. highly correlated declining growth patterns during drought can serve as a signal in silver fir, whereas changes in the content of sapwood soluble sugars are suitable vigour proxies for scots and aleppo pines. longer growth and defoliation series, additional vigour parameters and multi-species comparisons are required to understand and predict drought-induced tree death.",4,2015,103,1,44,57,10.1111/1365-2745.12295,0,0,1,1"Hantson, S;

dispersal; disturbance; diversity; edge effects; fragmentation; invasive species,"despite many studies showing that landscape corridors increase dispersal and species richness for disparate taxa, concerns persist that corridors can have unintended negative effects. in particular, some of the same mechanisms that underlie positive effects of corridors on species of conservation interest may also increase the spread and impact of antagonistic species (e.g., predators and pathogens), foster negative effects of edges, increase invasion by exotic species, increase the spread of unwanted disturbances such as fire, or increase population synchrony and thus reduce persistence. we conducted a literature review and meta-analysis to evaluate the prevalence of each of these negative effects. we found no evidence that corridors increase unwanted disturbance or non-native species invasion; however, these have not been well-studied concerns (1 and 6 studies, respectively). other effects of corridors were more often studied and yielded inconsistent results; mean effect sizes were indistinguishable from zero. the effect of edges on abundances of target species was as likely to be positive as negative. corridors were as likely to have no effect on antagonists or population synchrony as they were to increase those negative effects. we found 3 deficiencies in the literature. first, despite studies on how corridors affect predators, there are few studies of related consequences for prey population size and persistence. second, properly designed studies of negative corridor effects are needed in natural corridors at scales larger than those achievable in experimental systems. third, studies are needed to test more targeted hypotheses about when corridor-mediated effects on invasive species or disturbance may be negative for species of management concern. overall, we found no overarching support for concerns that construction and maintenance of habitat corridors may result in unintended negative consequences. negative edge effects may be mitigated by widening corridors or softening edges between corridors and the matrix. other negative effects are relatively small and manageable compared with the large positive effects of facilitating dispersal and increasing diversity of native species. efectos negativos potenciales de los corredores",4,2014,28,5,1178,1187,10.1111/cobi.12323,0,1,0,1"Jenkins, BR;

(2) update our understanding of leaf-cutting ant-promoted disturbance regimes; and (3) examine potential ecological roles by leaf-cutting ants within the context of human-modified landscapes to guide future research agendas. first, we find that leaf-cutting ants show that some herbivorous insects are able to generate ecologically important disturbance regimes via non-trophic activities. second, impacts of leaf-cutting ants can be observed at multiple spatio-temporal scales and levels of biological organization. third, ecosystem-level effects from leaf-cutting ants are ecosystem engineering capable not only of altering the abundance of other organisms, but also the successional trajectory of vegetation. finally, effects of leaf-cutting ants are context-dependent, species-specific, and synergistically modulated by anthropogenic interferences. future research should examine how leaf-cutting ants respond to deforestation and influence remaining vegetation in human-modified landscapes. by promoting either heterogeneity or homogeneity, leaf-cutting ants operate not only as agricultural pests but also as ecological key players.",5,2014,46,5,516,528,10.1111/btp.12126,1,0,0,1"Fox, R;

when a vertical measure of habitat structure has been employed, this is true in 84% of published studies. the potential efficacy of lidar in this field of biodiversity studies is underlined by several published examples of lidar modelling of animal species diversity. 4. we conclude that lidar remote sensing is fit for the purpose of biodiversity assessment and monitoring through its ability to characterize habitat structure, a key driver of animal species diversity, over large spatial scales. we advocate wider application of lidar-based hs-sd indicators to help tackle the current biodiversity crisis. in combination with other remote sensing products, these indicators may support the implementation and monitoring of environmental legislation, inform gap analyses and the planning of management actions for protected areas and species, and drive greater synergy with forest-based climate change mitigation.",7,2014,5,8,719,729,10.1111/2041-210X.12219,1,0,0,1"Rountrey, AN;

improved hydraulic efficiency seemed to promote higher secondary growth. 4. the observed greatest secondary growth (rw) and maximal vessel area (mva) at intermediate and intermediate-low elevations, respectively, contrasts with previous evidence of an improvement in plant reproduction and recruitment with increasing elevation for s.ciliata. however, our results are in agreement with other indicators suggesting that best conditions occur at intermediate elevations, such as better seed quality or larger genome size. 5. this study reinforces the evidence that the response of high-mountain plants to climatic change under simultaneous temperature and drought stress is complex and that models that simply assume an increase in elevation as a response to higher temperatures may fail to predict future responses to climate change.",6,2013,27,6,1295,1303,10.1111/1365-2435.12144,0,0,1,1"Spiesman, BJ;

invertebrates did not increase on either site. mesopredator release of mice was evident at the site where lizards did not increase, suggesting negative effects of mice on lizard populations. high mouse abundance occurred only on the predator-suppression site with regular production of pasture seed, indicating that this food resource was the main driver of mouse populations. removal of herbivores increased pasture and seed production, which further enhanced ecological release of mice, particularly where pasture swards were overtopped by shrubs. an effect of landscape supplementation was also evident where nearby fertilized pastures boosted rabbit numbers and the associated top predators. other studies have shown that both suppression of invasive predators and retiring land from grazing can benefit indigenous species, but our results suggest that the ensuing vegetation changes and complex interactions among invasive species can block recovery of indigenous fauna vulnerable to mesopredators. top-down and bottom-up ecological release of mesopredators and landscape supplementation of top predators are key processes to consider when managing invaded communities in complex landscapes.",10,2013,23,7,1707,1721,10.1890/12-1958.1,1,0,0,1"Emaresi, G;

death occurred rapidly at this temperature and more gradually under cool and dry conditions. foraging decreased under dry conditions, which suggests there were opportunity costs to water conservation. exposure to the herbicide atrazine additively decreased water-conserving behaviors, foraging efficiency, mass, and time to death. hence, the hypothesis that moderate climate change can cause population declines is even more plausible under scenarios with multiple stressors. these results suggest that climate change within the noncritical range of species and pollution may reduce individual performance by altering metabolic demands, hydration, and foraging effort and may facilitate population declines of amphibians and perhaps other ectothermic vertebrates.",14,2013,27,4,741,751,10.1111/cobi.12086,0,0,1,1"Filipe, AF;

a result that cannot be explained by an increase in physical habitat refugia in relatively more permanent ponds. manipulations of invertebrate predator diversity in mesocosms (both substitutive and additive treatments), and the addition of olfactory fish cues, revealed that strong non-consumptive effects of fish reduced predation by predatory invertebrates, and these effects overwhelmed the positive influence of invertebrate predator diversity on prey consumption. these results suggest that decreases in top-down control with increasing pond permanence are likely a result of non-consumptive effects of fish weakening predation by invertebrate predators in the more complex food webs of permanent ponds. therefore, considering non-consumptive effects of predators in complex food webs will likely improve the understanding of biotic interactions across environmental gradients.",5,2013,82,3,598,607,10.1111/1365-2656.12042,0,0,1,1"Cabrero, P;

temperate forest: 0.67 kgn ha(-1) yr(-1); steppe: 0.22 kgn ha(-1) yr(-1)), while rates of soil methane uptake were approximately equal for the temperate forest (-3.45 kgc ha(-1) yr(-1)) and the steppe (-3.39 kgc ha(-1) yr(-1)), but lower for the tropical forest site (-2.38 kgc ha(-1) yr(-1)). in order to allow for cross-site comparison of effects of changes in soil moisture and soil temperature on fluxes of methane and nitrous oxide, we used a normalization approach. data analysis with normalized data revealed that, across sites, optimum rates of methane uptake are found at environmental conditions representing approximately average site environmental conditions. this might have rather important implications for understanding effects of climate change on soil methane uptake potential, since any shift in environmental conditions is likely to result in a reduction of soil methane uptake ability. for nitrous oxide, our analysis revealed expected patterns: highest nitrous oxide emissions under moist and warm conditions and large nitrous oxide fluxes if soils are exposed to freeze-thawing effects at sufficiently high soil moisture contents. however, the explanatory power of relationships of soil moisture or soil temperature to nitrous oxide fluxes remained rather poor (r-2 <= 0.36). when combined effects of changes in soil moisture and soil temperature were considered, the explanatory power of our empirical relationships with regard to temporal variations in nitrous oxide fluxes were at maximum about 50 %. this indicates that other controlling factors such as n and c availability or microbial community dynamics might exert a significant control on the temporal dynamic of nitrous oxide fluxes. though underlying microbial processes such as nitrification and denitrification are sensitive to changes in the environmental regulating factors, important regulating factors like moisture and temperature seem to have both synergistic and antagonistic effects on the status of other regulating factors. thus we cannot expect a simple relationship between them and the pattern in the rate of emissions, associated with denitrification or nitrification in the soils. in conclusion, we hypothesize that our approach of data generalization may prove beneficial for the development of environmental response models, which can be used across sites, and which are needed to help achieve a better understanding of climate change feedbacks on biospheric sinks or sources of nitrous oxide and methane.",16,2013,10,5,3205,3219,10.5194/bg-10-3205-2013,1,1,0,2"Buchheister, A;

the cvg was 30.0 % at 20 a degrees c+cd and was significantly higher (147.6 %) in the 24 a degrees c+cd treatment. significant values of h(2) (= 0.23) and cva (= 89.7 %) were only found in the 24 a degrees c+cd treatment, suggesting that the ability to produce more offspring under this stressful condition may be inherited across sexual generations. in contrast, in the less stressful 20 a degrees c+cd treatment the h(2) (0.06) and cva (7.0 %) were very low and not significantly higher than zero. collectively our data indicate that both the asexual and sexual reproduction phases in cyclic parthenogenetic d. magna populations may play a role in the long-term adaptive potential of daphnia populations to chemical stress (with cd as the current example) and that environmental variables which influence the stress level of that chemical may influence this adaptive potential (with temperature as current example).",6,2012,21,7,1899,1910,10.1007/s10646-012-0923-2,0,0,1,1"Weydmann, A;

the latter defences could no longer be expressed when the host had already invested in fighting off the parasite. conclusions: in summary, our study suggests that as specific inducible defences differ in their costs, some might be suppressed if a target prey is additionally infected. therefore, adding parasite pressure to predator-prey systems can help to elucidate the costs of inducible defences.",5,2012,12,,,,10.1186/1472-6785-12-12,0,0,1,1"Mackay, AW;

within the range of the daily energy requirements of passerine moult). contrary to our predictions, house finches at subthermoneutral temperatures had lower disease expression and higher circulating levels of the cytokine interleukin-6 in response to experimental infection with m. gallisepticum than finches at thermoneutral. however, pathogen loads did not differ between the two temperature treatments. finches from both treatments expressed fever in response to infection, but the magnitude of fever did not vary with ambient temperature. 4. despite the significant energy costs of infection and thermoregulation, house finches from both temperature treatments maintained body mass and pectoral muscle condition, suggesting that birds housed at subthermoneutral consumed more food to maintain energy balance. in the field, competition for finite resources would be expected to exacerbate the effects found here and force infected birds to spend more time at feeders where m. gallisepticum is transmitted. 5. overall, our results indicate that moderate cold stress alters house finch immunity, energetics and disease pathology, but does not alter infectiousness as measured by pathogen load. the effects of ambient temperature on host response and energy demands could directly or indirectly contribute to seasonal and geographical variation in disease dynamics in free-living house finches. more broadly, our results suggest that even subtle changes in abiotic factors such as temperature can alter host disease expression, with broad implications for disease dynamics.",12,2012,26,3,701,710,10.1111/j.1365-2435.2012.01978.x,0,0,1,1"Bubliy, OA;

chemically-mediated interactions between the seaweed and its natural enemies; and the negative influence of elevated seawater temperature on these interactions. our understanding of these defense compounds and the functional roles they play for extends from molecular interactions with bacterial cell signaling molecules, to ecosystem-scale consequences of chemically-controlled disease and herbivory. produces halogenated furanones that antagonize the same receptor as acylated homoserine lactones (ahl)-a group of widespread intercellular communication signals among bacteria. halogenated furanones compete with and inhibit bacterial cell-to-cell communication, and thus interfere with important bacterial communication-regulated processes, such as biofilm formation. in a predictable pattern that occurs at the ecological level of entire populations, environmental stress interferes with the production of halogenated furanones, causing downstream processes that ultimately result in disease of the algal holobiont.",13,2012,38,5,442,450,10.1007/s10886-012-0119-5,0,1,0,1"Wang, XY;

for example, predator and prey species tended to co-occur in large-sized trees (a proxy of available bark/wood food resource primarily for the prey). in addition, some species segregation suggesting antagonistic, competitive, or prey-predator interactions were evident after accounting for the species' affinities for the same tree species. overall, our results suggest that an intimate link between habitat and interspecific interactions can have important roles for community assembly of saproxylic assemblages even following disturbance by fire. we also show that a systematic application of null models can offer insight into the mechanisms behind the assembly of ecological communities.",10,2012,168,4,1123,1135,10.1007/s00442-011-2180-0,0,1,0,1"O'Gorman, EJ;

excessive levels of par, however, can lead to additional inhibition of photosynthesis or growth under elevated co2, and addition of uv radiation (280 to 400 nm) can increase or down-regulate such inhibition, since solar uv-b (280 to 315 nm) radiation often harms algal cells, while uv-a (315 to 400 nm) at moderate levels stimulates photosynthetic carbon fixation in both phytoplankton and macroalgae. in view of warming effects, increased temperatures have been shown to enhance photorepair of uv-damaged molecules, though it simultaneously enhances respiratory carbon loss. the net effects of ocean acidification on marine primary producers are therefore largely dependent on the photobiological conditions (light limitation, light or uv stress), as well as interactions with rising temperature and other variables such as altered nutrient availability. hence, feedbacks between changing carbonate chemistry and solar radiation across the entire spectrum present complications to interpret and understand ocean acidification effects based on single-factor experiments.",45,2012,470,,167,189,10.3354/meps10043,1,1,0,2"Portner, HO",integrating climate-related stressor effects on marine organisms: unifying principles linking molecule to ecosystem-level changes,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,Article,Ocean warming;

elephant removed more tree volume from previously burned trees and the impact of subsequent fire was higher on previously burned or elephant-utilized trees than on undamaged trees. mortality was also affected by an interaction between previous and recent damage, as the probability of mortality was highest for trees that suffered from fire or elephant utilization after being pushed over. subsequent fire damage, but not elephant utilization, on debarked trees also increased the probability of mortality. mortality was twice (4.6% per annum) that of trees progressing into the 5 m height class, suggesting an overall decline in large tree density during the 30-month study period. the responses of large trees were species and landscape-specific in terms of sensitivity to elephant and fire impacts, as well as for levels of mortality and progression into the 5 m height class. these results emphasize the need for fine-scale site-specific knowledge for effective landscape level understanding of savanna dynamics.",13,2011,14,8,1372,1381,10.1007/s10021-011-9485-z,1,0,0,1"Chapman, BB;

while that of anurans followed this trend only for the conserved forest during the rainy season. regardless of distance, abundance and diversity of anurans markedly decreased during the dry season, while that of snakes and lizards increased. overall, our study shows that the importance of riparian areas for herpetofaunal conservation in dry tropical forests varies with forest condition and season. abstract in spanish is available at <externallink id=""http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/loi/btp"" type=""url"">http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/loi/btp.",5,2011,43,2,237,245,10.1111/j.1744-7429.2010.00677.x,1,0,0,1"Zhang, QG;

(e)-2-hexenal, (z)-3-hexenol, 1-hexanol, and (z)-3-hexenyl acetate) peaked at day 1 after larval feeding started, followed by an increase of emissions of ubiquitous monoterpenes peaking on days 2 and 3. the emission of the monoterpene (e)-beta-ocimene and of the nerolidol-derived homoterpene 4,8-dimethyl-nona-1,3,7-triene (dmnt) peaked on day 3. furthermore, the emission kinetics of the sesquiterpene (e,e)-alpha-farnesene tended to be biphasic with peaks on days 2 and 4 after start of larval feeding. emission rates of the induced lox products, of (e)-beta-ocimene and (e,e)-alpha-farnesene were positively correlated with the number of larvae feeding. in contrast, the emission of dmnt was independent of the number of feeders. these data show quantitative relationships between the strength of herbivory and the emissions of lox products and most of the terpenoids elicited in response to feeding. thus, herbivory-elicited lox products and terpenoid emissions may convey both quantitative and qualitative signals to antagonists of the herbivores. in contrast, our data suggest that the feeding-induced homoterpene dmnt conveys the information ""presence of herbivores"" rather than information about the quantities of herbivores to predators and parasitoids.",28,2011,37,1,18,28,10.1007/s10886-010-9897-9,0,1,0,1"Yang, JW;

observed and modeled increases in forest growth and canopy greening; widespread increases in woody-plant biomass, density, and extent; compensatory physiological, morphological, and genetic mechanisms; dampening ecological feedbacks; and potential mitigation by forest management. in contrast, recent studies document more rapid mortality under hotter drought due to negative tree physiological responses and accelerated biotic attacks. additional evidence suggesting greater vulnerability includes rising background mortality rates; projected increases in drought frequency, intensity, and duration; limitations of vegetation models such as inadequately represented mortality processes; warming feedbacks from die-off; and wildfire synergies. grouping these findings we identify ten contrasting perspectives that shape the vulnerability debate but have not been discussed collectively. we also present a set of global vulnerability drivers that are known with high confidence: (1) droughts eventually occur everywhere; (2) warming produces hotter droughts; (3) atmospheric moisture demand increases nonlinearly with temperature during drought; (4) mortality can occur faster in hotter drought, consistent with fundamental physiology; (5) shorter droughts occur more frequently than longer droughts and can become lethal under warming, increasing the frequency of lethal drought nonlinearly; and (6) mortality happens rapidly relative to growth intervals needed for forest recovery. these high-confidence drivers, in concert with research supporting greater vulnerability perspectives, support an overall viewpoint of greater forest vulnerability globally. we surmise that mortality vulnerability is being discounted in part due to difficulties in predicting threshold responses to extreme climate events. given the profound ecological and societal implications of underestimating global vulnerability to hotter drought, we highlight urgent challenges for research, management, and policy-making communities.",2,2015,6,8,,,10.1890/ES15-00203.1,1,0,0,1"Wenzel, MA;

years 3-6), declining significantly with the exclusion of native species by invasive grasses (years 9-14). furthermore, the increasing dominance of invasive grasses was associated with a steady decline in the concentration of soil nitrogen and phosphorus per unit of accumulated carbon. these results demonstrate the importance of interdependent ecological and biogeochemical processes, and the role of soil-plant interactions in determining the success of restoration efforts. in contrast with previous but unsuccessful attempts to restore mined areas through nutrient application alone, iron-mediated stabilization of vegetation inputs favored the regeneration of a barren stable state that had persisted for over five decades since disturbance. the effectiveness of coupled organic matter and iron fertilization, combined with management of invasive species, has the possibility to enhance terrestrial carbon sequestration and accelerate the restoration of degraded lands, while addressing important challenges associated with urban waste disposal.",0,2015,25,5,1226,1234,10.1890/14-2151.1,1,0,0,1"Irizar, A;

Optimal foraging; Resource partitioning; Competition; Mutualism; Antagonism,"the romantic perception of plant-animal mutualisms as a cooperative endeavour has been shattered in the last decades. while the classic theory of plant-pollinator coevolution assumed that partner coevolution is largely mutualistic, an increasing appreciation of the inherent conflict of interests between such partners has led to the realization that genes that confer a reproductive advantage to plants may have negative effects on their pollinators (and vice versa), giving rise to an apparent paradox: that antagonistic processes may drive coevolution among mutualistic partners. under this new paradigm, mutualistic partners are bound by mutual interest but shaped by ""selfish"" antagonistic processes. exploitation barriers mediated by resource competition among pollinators are a key element of this paradigm. exploitation barriers involve traits such as tubular corollas, red flowers, toxic or deterrent rewards, and attractants of floral predators. exploitation barriers result in resource partitioning, increasing floral fidelity of favoured pollinators and therefore plant fitness; but they often entail a physiological, behavioural or developmental cost for such favoured pollinators. resource partitioning mediated by exploitation barriers is a very powerful driver of floral diversification, robust to variation in pollinator assemblages; hence, it may contribute to elucidating the occurrence of co-evolutionary changes in multi-species contexts. exploitation barriers provide also a mechanistic basis for trait-based modelling of interaction networks, and represent a reason for caution in assuming fixed interaction identity or strength when modelling such networks (e.g. in rarefaction procedures used to estimate secondary extinctions). we propose to replace the misleading metaphor that depicts flowers and pollinators as cooperative partners by a metaphor in which plants and pollinator are traders, seeking to obtain different services from each other in complete disregard for the benefit of their mutualistic partner.",0,2015,29,3,311,322,10.1007/s10682-015-9757-8,0,1,0,1"Ferrari, MCO;

mudfish occupied 88 percent of temporary pools due to their tolerance of habitat drying, whereas kokopu were absent from temporary pools. within permanent pools, mudfish occurrence was negatively related to pool oxygen and ph, whereas kokopu occurrence was positively related to these conditions. pool conditions were independently distributed in the landscape, suggesting that each abiotic stressor offered additive refuge for mudfish from kokopu predation/competition. consequently, the mudfish realised niche breadth depended on the number of abiotic factors driving their allopatry with kokopu. given the widespread negative relationships between niche breadth and species extinction probabilities, our results indicate that tolerance to multiple stressors may play an important role in insuring species persistence against the multiple drivers of global environmental change.",0,2015,38,2,154,162,10.1111/ecog.00526,0,0,1,1"Nepoux, V;

increased ail. temperature (1 degrees-6 degrees c); simultaneous changes in both precipitation (+/-50%, +/-25%) and air temperature (+1 to +6 degrees c) and increased interannual variability (iav) of precipitation (+1 sigma to +3 sigma, with fixed means, where a is sd). we fitted model output from these scenarios to huxman et al.'s ruemax bioclimatic model, npp = alpha + rue x ppt (where alpha is the intercept, rue is rain use efficiency, and ppt is annual precipitation). based on these analyses, we conclude that there is strong support (when not explicit, then trend-wise) for huxman et al.'s assertion that biomes converge to a common ruemax during the driest years at a site, thus representing the boundary for highest rain use efficiency; the interactive effects of simultaneously decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature on npp for the tp is smaller than might be expected from additive, single-factor changes in these drivers;

whereas ash-derived substrates have higher numbers of native tree species regenerating and many fewer exotic species. discussion the tropical montane forests on mauna kea reflect a native-dominated plant community response to disturbance on both lava- and ash-derived volcanic substrates, and a higher propensity for exotic species to occur on the lava-derived substrate. native plant communities on ash-derived soils may have higher resilience to exotic invasion than communities on lava-derived substrates. our results indicate resource managers should explicitly account for variation in soils and substrate type when prioritizing, implementing and monitoring management interventions to foster native plant assemblages and control the spread of exotic and invasive species.",1,2014,25,3,734,749,10.1111/jvs.12112,0,0,1,1"Qadri, M;

Intertidal; Photosynthesis; Temperature; Ultraviolet radiation; Upwelling,"ecological consequences of punctuated, extreme climate events depend largely upon species' physiological capacity to tolerate and recover from such stressful events. however, physiological responses of intertidal organisms to repetitive exposure to severe conditions using natural patterns are rarely explored, and we know little about how physiological sensitivity within a species varies over local scales or among natural populations, making it difficult to extrapolate results to the naturally variable environmental conditions encountered in the field. here, we simulate realistic scenarios of the exposure of the turf-forming alga (gelidium chilense) to atmospheric stressors (uvb and temperature) associated with natural mild or harsh weather conditions that occur when summertime midday low tides coincide with unusually calm seas and particularly warm, sunny days along the central chilean coast. we show that sudden, short-term exposure to artificial uvb radiation during daytime low tides represents a strong stress factor for gelidium turf algae as measured by the changes in maximal photosynthetic quantum yield (fv/fm), and repetitive exposure over a period of 5 d, as it occurs naturally during spring summer days, can critically compromise the ability of the fronds to recover once the stressor is removed. in contrast, while increased aerial temperature had important effects on the photosynthetic system, this source of stress had no lasting effects on the fronds' capacity to recover, nor did it modify the uvb effects on photosynthesis (i.e. no synergistic effects between these common stressors). the ability of gelidium turf to recover from uvb-induced damage to the photosynthetic apparatus differed between tidal heights and among populations from different sites along the central coast. these results suggest that for many shore communities, abrupt, unpredictable short-term stress events will have greater consequences lower on the shore. we found no evidence that greater upwelling intensity and associated nutrient enrichment of coastal waters could consistently ameliorate recovery from the negative effects of uvb. the complex spatial variation in the turfs ability to recover rapidly from a stress event may alter predictions regarding the effects of extreme climate events and/or climate change on species interactions and species' geographic distribution.

however, factors associated with clutch identity (e.g., genetic or maternal) may influence the effects of such plasticity. the red-eyed treefrog (agalychnis callidryas) is an ideal organism for investigating the effects of genetics and life stage switch point timing because embryos exhibit adaptive phenotypic plasticity in hatching time. in this study, we evaluated the effects of experimentally manipulated hatching time and clutch identity on antipredator behavior of tadpoles and on developmental traits of metamorphs, including larval period, mass, svl, and jumping ability. we found that in the presence of dragonfly nymph predator cues at 21 days post-oviposition, tadpoles reduced both their activity level and height in the water column. furthermore, early-hatched tadpoles were less active than late-hatched tadpoles of the same age. this difference in behavior patterns of early- and late-hatched tadpoles may represent an adaptive response due to a longer period of susceptibility to odonate predators for early-hatched tadpoles, or it may be a carry-over effect mediated by early exposure to an environmental stressor (i.e., induction of early hatching). we also found that hatching time affected both behavioral traits and developmental traits, but its effect on developmental traits varied significantly among clutches. this study shows that a single early-life event may influence a suite of factors during subsequent life stages and that some of these effects appear to be dependent on clutch identity. this interaction may represent an evolutionary response to a complex life cycle and unpredictable environments, regardless of whether the clutch differences are due to additive genetic variance or maternal effects.",2,2013,171,4,831,843,10.1007/s00442-012-2443-4,0,0,1,1"Saccone, P;

haussmann & marchetto 2010). geiger (2011) found that chicks entering the post-winter growth season at a smaller size exhibited increased growth rates (i.e. catch-up growth) at the cost of increased oxidative stress and reduced telomere lengths compared with the chicks entering the growth period at a larger size. furthermore, chicks that did not survive had drastically shorter telomere lengths and reduced antioxidant capacities at the beginning of the growth period than all other chicks, thereby directly associating telomere length to mortality. these results suggest that while catch-up growth allows smaller chicks to head off into the world on equal footing with chicks that hatched at a larger size, it likely comes at the cost of a shortened lifespan. thus, this study provides a mechanism that supports the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of senescence (promislow 2004).",1,2012,21,6,1307,1310,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05430.x,0,1,0,1"Lloyd, JD;

fecal thyroid hormone metabolites (ft3), which reflect nutrition; and the number of offspring fledged within a season. we experimentally applied one hour of motorcycle exposure to nsos during periods of incubation (may) and fledging (july), comparing fgc levels of treated nso with those of non-exposed controls. acute vehicle exposure generally increased fgcs in the short term. males showed the highest glucocorticoid response to vehicle disturbance in may when they were typically solely responsible for feeding themselves, their mates and their nestlings. by contrast, response to motorcycle exposure among females depended on their level of ft3 and their number of young. levels of fgcs were highest post treatment among females that lacked young and had high ft3 (good nutrition); fgc levels were lower in treated females compared to controls among females with two young and low ft3 (compromised nutrition), possibly reflecting allostatic overload. the correlational approach showed that nso close to roads had higher levels of ft3, suggesting better nutrition. surprisingly, fgc levels were unrelated to proximity of roads, irrespective of noise. presumably, the tendency for traffic exposure to increase fgcs over the long-term was offset by nutritional gains (i.e., reduced fgcs and high ft3) associated with proximity to roads. sound level meters enabled us to quantify road noise on a subset of nso territories. nso close to noisy roads fledged significantly fewer young than nso near quiet roads, indicating that routine traffic exposure may decrease nso reproductive success over time.",0,2011,2,6,,,10.1890/ES10-00199.1,0,0,1,1"Reeves, MK;
