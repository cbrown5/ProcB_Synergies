Some disturbances can drive ecological systems to abrupt shifts between alternative stages (tipping points) when critical transitions occur. Drought-induced tree death can be considered as a nonlinear shift in tree vigour and growth. However, at what point do trees become predisposed to drought-related dieback and which factors determine this (tipping) point? We investigated these questions by characterizing the responses of three tree species, silver fir (Abies alba), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis), to a severe drought event. 2. We compared basal area increment (BAI) trends and responses to climate and drought in declining (very defoliated and dying) vs. non-declining (slightly or not defoliated) trees by using generalized additive mixed models. Defoliation, BAI and sapwood production were related to functional proxies of tree vigour measured at the onset and end of the drought (non-structural carbohydrate concentrations, needle N content and C isotopic discrimination, presence of wood-inhabiting fungi). We evaluated whether early warning signals (increases in synchronicity among trees or in autocorrelation and standard deviation) could be extracted from the BAI series prior to tree death. 3. Declining silver fir and Scots pine trees showed less growth than non-declining trees one to three decades, respectively, before the drought event, whereas Aleppo pines showed growth decline irrespective of tree defoliation. At the end of the drought period, all species showed increased defoliation and a related reduction in the concentration of sapwood soluble sugars. Defoliation was constrained by the BAI of the previous 5 years and sapwood production. No specific wood-inhabiting fungi were found in post-drought declining trees apart from blue-stain fungi, which extensively affected damaged Scots pines. Declining silver firs showed increases in BAI autocorrelation and variability prior to tree death. 4. Synthesis. Early warning signals of drought-triggered mortality seem to be species specific and reflect how different tree species cope with drought stress. Highly correlated declining growth patterns during drought can serve as a signal in silver fir, whereas changes in the content of sapwood soluble sugars are suitable vigour proxies for Scots and Aleppo pines. Longer growth and defoliation series, additional vigour parameters and multi-species comparisons are required to understand and predict drought-induced tree death.",4,2015,103,1,44,57,10.1111/1365-2745.12295"Hantson, S; Pueyo, S; Chuvieco, E",Global fire size distribution is driven by human impact and climate,GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,Article,Fire size distribution; fire ecology; power law; self-organized criticality; SOC; wildland fire,"AimIn order to understand fire's impacts on vegetation dynamics, it is crucial that the distribution of fire sizes be known. We approached this distribution using a power-law distribution, which derives from self-organized criticality theory (SOC). We compute the global spatial variation in the power-law exponent and determine the main factors that explain its spatial distribution. LocationGlobal, at 2 degrees grid resolution. MethodsWe use satellite-derived MODIS burned-area data (MCD45) to obtain global individual fire size data for 2002-2010, grouped together for each 2 degrees grid. A global map of fire size distribution was produced by plotting the exponent of the power law. The drivers of the spatial trends in fire size distribution, including vegetation productivity, precipitation, population density and net income, were analysed using a generalized additive model (GAM). ResultsThe power law gave a good fit for 93% of the global 2 degrees grid cells with important fire activity. A global map of the fire size distribution, as approached by the power law shows strong spatial patterns. These are associated both with climatic variables (precipitation and evapotranspiration) and with anthropogenic variables (cropland cover and population density). Main conclusionsOur results indicate that the global fire size distribution changes over gradients of precipitation and aridity, and that it is strongly influenced by human activity. This information is essential for understanding potential changes in fire sizes as a result of climate change and socioeconomic dynamics. The ability to improve SOC fire models by including these human and climatic factors would benefit fire projections as well as fire management and policy.",5,2015,24,1,77,86,10.1111/geb.12246"Paaby, AB; Bergland, AO; Behrman, EL; Schmidt, PS",A highly pleiotropic amino acid polymorphism in the Drosophila insulin receptor contributes to life-history adaptation,EVOLUTION,Article,Adaptation; cline; InR; pleiotropy; seasonality,"Finding the specific nucleotides that underlie adaptive variation is a major goal in evolutionary biology, but polygenic traits pose a challenge because the complex genotype-phenotype relationship can obscure the effects of individual alleles. However, natural selection working in large wild populations can shift allele frequencies and indicate functional regions of the genome. Previously, we showed that the two most common alleles of a complex amino acid insertion-deletion polymorphism in the Drosophila insulin receptor show independent, parallel clines in frequency across the North American and Australian continents. Here, we report that the cline is stable over at least a five-year period and that the polymorphism also demonstrates temporal shifts in allele frequency concurrent with seasonal change. We tested the alleles for effects on levels of insulin signaling, fecundity, development time, body size, stress tolerance, and life span. We find that the alleles are associated with predictable differences in these traits, consistent with patterns of Drosophila life-history variation across geography that likely reflect adaptation to the heterogeneous climatic environment. These results implicate insulin signaling as a major mediator of life-history adaptation in Drosophila, and suggest that life-history trade-offs can be explained by extensive pleiotropy at a single locus.",4,2014,68,12,3395,3409,10.1111/evo.12546"Reside, AE; Welbergen, JA; Phillips, BL; Wardell-Johnson, GW; Keppel, G; Ferrier, S; Williams, SE; Vanderwal, J",Characteristics of climate change refugia for Australian biodiversity,AUSTRAL ECOLOGY,Review,climate change; conservation; refugia; synergies; terrestrial biodiversity,"Identifying refugia is a critical component of effective conservation of biodiversity under anthropogenic climate change.

Further, we classify refugia in terms of the environmental and biotic stressors that they provide protection from (i.e. thermal, hydric, cyclonic, pyric and biotic refugia), but ideally refugia should provide protection from a multitude of stressors. Our systematic characterization of refugia facilitates the identification of refugia in the Australian landscape.

We undertook a meta-analysis, using data from 118 studies to test the hypothesis that ongoing global declines in the dominant habitat along temperate rocky coastlines, forests of canopy-forming algae and/or their replacement by mat-forming algae are driven by the nonadditive interactions between local anthropogenic stressors that can be addressed through management actions (fishing, heavy metal pollution, nutrient enrichment and high sediment loads) and other stressors (presence of competitors or grazers, removal of canopy algae, limiting or excessive light, low or high salinity, increasing temperature, high wave exposure and high UV or CO2), not as easily amenable to management actions. In general, the cumulative effects of local anthropogenic and other stressors had negative effects on the growth and survival of canopy-forming algae. Conversely, the growth or survival of mat-forming algae was either unaffected or significantly enhanced by the same pairs of stressors. Contrary to our predictions, the majority of interactions between stressors were additive. There were however synergistic interactions between nutrient enrichment and heavy metals, the presence of competitors, low light and increasing temperature, leading to amplified negative effects on canopy-forming algae. There were also synergistic interactions between nutrient enrichment and increasing CO2 and temperature leading to amplified positive effects on mat-forming algae. Our review of the current literature shows that management of nutrient levels, rather than fishing, heavy metal pollution or high sediment loads, would provide the greatest opportunity for preventing the shift from canopy to mat-forming algae, particularly in enclosed bays or estuaries because of the higher prevalence of synergistic interactions between nutrient enrichment with other local and global stressors, and as such it should be prioritized.",8,2014,20,11,3300,3312,10.1111/gcb.12619"Haddad, NM; Brudvig, LA; Damschen, EI; Evans, DM; Johnson, BL; Levey, DJ; Orrock, JL; Resasco, J; Sullivan, LL; Tewksbury, JJ; Wagner, SA; Weldon, AJ",Potential Negative Ecological Effects of Corridors,CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,Review,connectivity; dispersal; disturbance; diversity; edge effects; fragmentation; invasive species,"Despite many studies showing that landscape corridors increase dispersal and species richness for disparate taxa, concerns persist that corridors can have unintended negative effects. In particular, some of the same mechanisms that underlie positive effects of corridors on species of conservation interest may also increase the spread and impact of antagonistic species (e.g., predators and pathogens), foster negative effects of edges, increase invasion by exotic species, increase the spread of unwanted disturbances such as fire, or increase population synchrony and thus reduce persistence. We conducted a literature review and meta-analysis to evaluate the prevalence of each of these negative effects. We found no evidence that corridors increase unwanted disturbance or non-native species invasion; however, these have not been well-studied concerns (1 and 6 studies, respectively). Other effects of corridors were more often studied and yielded inconsistent results; mean effect sizes were indistinguishable from zero. The effect of edges on abundances of target species was as likely to be positive as negative. Corridors were as likely to have no effect on antagonists or population synchrony as they were to increase those negative effects. We found 3 deficiencies in the literature. First, despite studies on how corridors affect predators, there are few studies of related consequences for prey population size and persistence. Second, properly designed studies of negative corridor effects are needed in natural corridors at scales larger than those achievable in experimental systems. Third, studies are needed to test more targeted hypotheses about when corridor-mediated effects on invasive species or disturbance may be negative for species of management concern. Overall, we found no overarching support for concerns that construction and maintenance of habitat corridors may result in unintended negative consequences. Negative edge effects may be mitigated by widening corridors or softening edges between corridors and the matrix. Other negative effects are relatively small and manageable compared with the large positive effects of facilitating dispersal and increasing diversity of native species.

We assessed the heritable variation underlying differences in hormonal phenotypes using a cross-foster experimental design with nestling North American barn swallows (Hirundo rustica erythrogaster). Using a bivariate animal model, we partitioned variance in baseline and stress-induced CORT concentrations into their additive genetic and rearing environment components and estimated their genetic correlation. Both baseline and stress-induced CORT were heritable with heritability of 0.152 and 0.343, respectively. We found that the variation in baseline CORT was best explained by rearing environment, whereas the variation in stress-induced CORT was contributed to by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Further, we did not detect a genetic correlation between these two hormonal traits. Although rearing environment appears to play an important role in the secretion of both types of CORT, our results suggest that stress-induced CORT levels are underlain by greater additive genetic variance compared with baseline CORT levels.

Leaf-cutting ants represent one of the most important herbivores of the Neotropics and offer an interesting opportunity to address the role played by herbivorous insects through a perspective that embraces population- to ecosystem-level effects. Here we: (1) qualitatively summarize the multiple ways leaf-cutting ants interact with food plants and their habitats and elucidate the ultimate outcome of such interactions at multiple organization levels; (2) update our understanding of leaf-cutting ant-promoted disturbance regimes; and (3) examine potential ecological roles by leaf-cutting ants within the context of human-modified landscapes to guide future research agendas. First, we find that leaf-cutting ants show that some herbivorous insects are able to generate ecologically important disturbance regimes via non-trophic activities. Second, impacts of leaf-cutting ants can be observed at multiple spatio-temporal scales and levels of biological organization. Third, ecosystem-level effects from leaf-cutting ants are ecosystem engineering capable not only of altering the abundance of other organisms, but also the successional trajectory of vegetation. Finally, effects of leaf-cutting ants are context-dependent, species-specific, and synergistically modulated by anthropogenic interferences. Future research should examine how leaf-cutting ants respond to deforestation and influence remaining vegetation in human-modified landscapes.

Reciprocally adapted populations display fitness trade-offs across environments, but little is known about the traits and genes underlying fitness trade-offs in reciprocally adapted populations. We investigated the genetic basis and adaptive significance of freezing tolerance using locally adapted populations of Arabidopsis thaliana from Italy and Sweden. Previous reciprocal transplant studies of these populations indicated that subfreezing temperature is a major selective agent in Sweden. We used quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to identify the contribution of freezing tolerance to previously demonstrated local adaptation and genetic trade-offs. First, we compared the genomic locations of freezing tolerance QTL to those for previously published QTL for survival in Sweden, and overall fitness in the field. Then, we estimated the contributions to survival and fitness across both field sites of genotypes at locally adaptive freezing tolerance QTL. In growth chamber studies, we found seven QTL for freezing tolerance, and the Swedish genotype increased freezing tolerance for five of these QTL. Three of these colocalized with locally adaptive survival QTL in Sweden and with trade-off QTL for overall fitness. Two freezing tolerance QTL contribute to genetic trade-offs across environments for both survival and overall fitness. A major regulator of freezing tolerance, CBF2, is implicated as a candidate gene for one of the trade-off freezing tolerance QTL.

Species' distributions are likely to be affected by a combination of environmental drivers. We used a data set of 11 million species occurrence records over the period 1970-2010 to assess changes in the frequency of occurrence of 673 macro-moth species in Great Britain. Groups of species with different predicted sensitivities showed divergent trends, which we interpret in the context of land-use and climatic changes. 2. A diversity of responses was revealed: 260 moth species declined significantly, whereas 160 increased significantly. Overall, frequencies of occurrence declined, mirroring trends in less species-rich, yet more intensively studied taxa. 3. Geographically widespread species, which were predicted to be more sensitive to land use than to climate change, declined significantly in southern Britain, where the cover of urban and arable land has increased. 4. Moths associated with low nitrogen and open environments (based on their larval host plant characteristics) declined most strongly, which is also consistent with a land-use change explanation. 5. Some moths that reach their northern (leading edge) range limit in southern Britain increased, whereas species restricted to northern Britain (trailing edge) declined significantly, consistent with a climate change explanation. 6. Not all species of a given type behaved similarly, suggesting that complex interactions between species' attributes and different combinations of environmental drivers determine frequency of occurrence changes. 7. Synthesis and applications. Our findings are consistent with large-scale responses to climatic and land-use changes, with some species increasing and others decreasing. We suggest that landuse change (e. g. habitat loss, nitrogen deposition) and climate change are both major drivers of moth biodiversity change, acting independently and in combination. Importantly, the diverse responses revealed in this species-rich taxon show that multifaceted conservation strategies are needed to minimize negative biodiversity impacts of multiple environmental changes.

Habitat structure is important in explaining species diversity patterns for many animal groups. If we could map habitat structure over large spatial scales, we could use habitat structure-species diversity (HS-SD) relationships to model species diversity and inform conservation planning and management. Traditional approaches for measuring habitat structure cannot be applied over entire landscapes, but remote sensing tools are now able to overcome this limitation. Here, we explore the potential of airborne lidar for the assessment and monitoring of animal species diversity in terrestrial environments. 2. We review the habitat attributes commonly recorded in the study of HS-SD relationships and the spatial scale of their measurement, in papers published between 1960 and 2013. We also gather evidence for the use of lidar to make relevant measurements at similar scales. 3. Eight out of 15 attributes of habitat structure commonly used in published studies relate to the vertical dimension of habitat. The core strength of lidar is that it is a vertical profiler, and this technology can be used to derive estimates of all but one of these structural attributes. Lidar can also be used to improve the measurement of the four commonly used attributes focusing on the horizontal heterogeneity of habitat patches. The spatial grain and extent of HS-SD studies is usually within the operational capability of airborne lidar; when a vertical measure of habitat structure has been employed, this is true in 84% of published studies. The potential efficacy of lidar in this field of biodiversity studies is underlined by several published examples of lidar modelling of animal species diversity. 4. We conclude that lidar remote sensing is fit for the purpose of biodiversity assessment and monitoring through its ability to characterize habitat structure, a key driver of animal species diversity, over large spatial scales. We advocate wider application of lidar-based HS-SD indicators to help tackle the current biodiversity crisis. In combination with other remote sensing products, these indicators may support the implementation and monitoring of environmental legislation, inform gap analyses and the planning of management actions for protected areas and species, and drive greater synergy with forest-based climate change mitigation.",7,2014,5,8,719,729,10.1111/2041-210X.12219"Berger, D; Grieshop, K; Lind, MI; Goenaga, J; Maklakov, AA; Arnqvist, G",INTRALOCUS SEXUAL CONFLICT AND ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS,EVOLUTION,Article,Adaptation; condition dependence; genetic quality; sexual selection; sexually antagonistic; temperature,"Intralocus sexual conflict (IaSC) occurs when selection at a given locus favors different alleles in males and females, placing a fundamental constraint on adaptation. However, the relative impact of IaSC on adaptation may become reduced in stressful environments that expose conditionally deleterious mutations to selection. The genetic correlation for fitness between males and females (r(MF)) provides a quantification of IaSC across the genome. We compared IaSC at a benign (29 degrees C) and a stressful (36 degrees C) temperature by estimating r(MF)s in two natural populations of the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus using isofemale lines. In one population, we found substantial IaSC under benign conditions signified by a negative r(MF) (-0.51) and, as predicted, a significant reduction of IaSC under stress signified by a reversed and positive r(MF) (0.21). The other population displayed low IaSC at both temperatures (r(MF): 0.38; 0.40). In both populations, isofemale lines harboring alleles beneficial to males but detrimental to females at benign conditions tended to show overall low fitness under stress.

However, efforts to model the impact of climate change on fish growth have been hampered by a lack of long-term (multidecadal) data needed to understand the effects of temperature on growth rates in natural environments. We used a combination of dendrochronology techniques and additive mixed-effects modeling to examine the sensitivity of growth in a long-lived (up to 70 years), endemic marine fish, the western blue groper (Achoerodus gouldii), to changes in water temperature. A multi-decadal biochronology (1952-2003) of growth was constructed from the otoliths of 56 fish collected off the southwestern coast of Western Australia, and we tested for correlations between the mean index chronology and a range of potential environmental drivers. The chronology was significantly correlated with sea surface temperature in the region, but common variance among individuals was low. This suggests that this species has been relatively insensitive to past variations in climate. Growth increment and age data were also used in an additive mixed model to predict otolith growth and body size later this century. Although growth was relatively insensitive to changes in temperature, the model results suggested that a fish aged 20 in 2099 would have an otolith about 10% larger and a body size about 5% larger than a fish aged 20 in 1977.

The aim of this study is to correlate growth of a single lineage of broadleaf evergreen trees with continental-scale variability in climate. Location Australia's temperate mesic eucalypt forests, spanning latitudes from 23 to 43 degrees S and longitudes from 115 to 153 degrees E. Methods We compiled and analysed a dataset containing around half a million measurements of growth in eucalypt tree diameter, collected from 2409 permanent forestry plots. These plots spanned a range of 558-2105 mm mean annual precipitation and 6-22 degrees C mean annual temperature. Generalized additive models were used to study the relationship between growth in tree diameter and several temperature and water availability variables. Results Tree growth increased with precipitation, but with a diminishing response above a mean annual precipitation of 1400 mm. There was a peaked response to temperature, with maximum growth occurring at a mean annual temperature of 11 degrees C and maximum temperature of the warmest month of 25-27 degrees C. Lower temperatures directly constrain growth. High temperatures primarily reduced growth by reducing water availability, but they also appeared to exert a direct negative effect. Our best model, which included maximum temperature of the warmest month and the ratio of precipitation to evaporation, explained 28% of the deviance.

These changes may have important consequences for the physiological performance of early life-history stages of marine organisms. In this study we investigated the potential for interactive effects of ecologically relevant levels of temperature and pCO(2) on germination, dormancy and mortality of zoospores of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, a foundation species of temperate reef ecosystems. Newly settled kelp spores were cultured in the laboratory for seven days in a factorial design with temperature (13 degrees C and 18 degrees C) and pCO(2) (similar to 370 and similar to 1800 mu atm) as experimental factors. The two levels of temperature and the low-pCO(2) treatment in our design were consistent with present-day environmental conditions in the kelp forest as measured by autonomous temperature and pH sensors, while the high-pCO(2) treatment reflects an extreme, future acidification scenario. Our results revealed that the combined effects of increased temperature and pCO(2) can significantly decrease germination rates and increase the mortality of kelp spores. Interactive effects of temperature and pCO(2) were detected,on spore mortality and dormancy. Spore mortality only differed between pCO(2) treatments at high temperature. In contrast, spore dormancy was higher in the treatment with low temperature and high pCO(2), which is similar to the environmental conditions experienced during upwelling events in southern California.

We analysed 39 studies dealing with direct response of plant to ECEs in different ecosystems, with a particular focus on cold ecosystems (alpine and arctic). Although the number of studies increases every year, the understanding of ecological consequences of ECEs is fragmentary. In general, ECEs affected negatively on physiological processes (efficiency of photosystem II, stomatal conductance and leaf water potential), productivity and reproduction, and had consequences on population demography and recruitment several years after ECE. Indeed, the plant responses to ECEs were species specific and depended on the plant life stage and the timing of ECE. In fact, the magnitude of the effect of ECEs decreased over the growing season. Drought had the most severe effect on plants, while heat waves had minor effect if water was available. The overlap of different ECEs had an additive effect (e.g. drought associated to heat-waves).

Grasslands cover similar to 30% of the Earth's terrestrial surface and provide many ecosystem services. Many grasslands are heavily managed to maximize these services for human benefit, but the outcome of management is anticipated to be increasingly influenced by various aspects of climate change and elevated atmospheric CO2. The relative importance of global change vs. land management on grasslands is largely unknown. 2. A meta-analysis is used here to examine drivers at both scales primarily targeting services provided by grasslands relating to plant productivity (above- and below-ground biomass) and soil processes (nutrients and soil respiration) in 38 manipulative experiments published in the last decade. We specifically target effects of (i) single and combined land management practices (LMs), (ii) single and combined factors relating to broad-scale climate change and elevated CO2, and (iii) combined management practices and changes to climate and CO2. Collectively, this examines the general efficacy of global change models in predicting changes to grassland functioning. 3. We found that combinations of management practices had approximately double the explanatory power for variation in grassland services compared with individual or interactive effects of factors associated with climate change and CO2. These interacting management practices such as nutrient additions and defoliation predominantly influenced functions associated with productivity or biomass both below and above ground. The effects of interacting factors of climate and CO2 influenced a wider range of ecosystem functions, but the magnitude of these effects was relatively smaller. 4. Interactions between management practices or between climate change/CO2 factors always had higher explanatory power than any factor in isolation indicating that multivariate synergistic models of environmental change can better describe impacts on ecosystem function in plant communities (e.g. relative to univariate climate-based models). Given that the magnitude and direction (positive or negative) of the interactions varied widely, this also implies that the outcomes of these multivariate interactions can vary spatially, temporally or by immediate context (e.g. management prescriptions). 5. Synthesis. Although our work confirms how climate change and CO2 can affect many ecosystem-based functional attributes, it suggests that combinations of LMs remain the dominant set of factors in determining the performance of grassland plant communities. Land management may thus be critical for influencing projected responses to future climate change and elevated CO2 in models of grassland function at least for factors relating to primary production.",5,2014,102,4,896,904,10.1111/1365-2745.12236"Otto, SP",Selective maintenance of recombination between the sex chromosomes,JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,Article,modifier; recombination; sex chromosomes; sex-determining region; sexually antagonistic selection,"A hallmark of many sex chromosomes is the dramatically reduced rate of recombination between them in the heterogametic sex (e.g. between the X and Y). Sexually antagonistic selection is thought to be the main selective driver of this reduced recombination, with tighter linkage strengthening the association between alleles favourable to females and the X, as well as alleles favourable to males and the Y. Nevertheless, many sex chromosomes retain substantial levels of recombination over millions of years, and some old sex chromosomes remain homomorphic with few signs of recombination suppression and the chromosomal degradation expected to follow. This paper explores the selective factors that can maintain recombination between the sex chromosomes. Specifically, by analysing the dynamics of genes that modify the rate of recombination, I present results demonstrating that certain forms of selection - all involving overdominance in males - can positively maintain recombination in the pseudo-autosomal region. To understand these cases, one has to revise our standard view of sexual antagonistic selection as involving two partners (males and females) to three partners (the X in females, the X in males and the Y).",4,2014,27,7,1431,1442,10.1111/jeb.12324"Cabral, JS; Weigelt, P; Kissling, WD; Kreft, H","Biogeographic, climatic and spatial drivers differentially affect alpha-, beta- and gamma-diversities on oceanic archipelagos",PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,Article,alpha-diversity; archipelago; beta-diversity; gamma-diversity; spatial variables; species richness,"Island biogeographic studies traditionally treat single islands as units of analysis. This ignores the fact that most islands are spatially nested within archipelagos. Here, we took a fundamentally different approach and focused on entire archipelagos using species richness of vascular plants on 23 archipelagos worldwide and their 174 constituent islands. We assessed differential effects of biogeographic factors (area, isolation, age, elevation), current and past climate (temperature, precipitation, seasonality, climate change velocity) and intra-archipelagic spatial structure (archipelago area, number of islands, area range, connectivity, environmental volume, inter-island distance) on plant diversity. Species diversity of each archipelago (gamma) was additively partitioned into alpha, beta, nestedness and replacement beta-components to investigate the relative importance of environmental and spatial drivers. Multiple regressions revealed strong effects of biogeography and climate on alpha and gamma, whereas spatial factors, particularly number of islands, inter-island distance and area range, were key to explain beta. Structural equation models additionally suggested that gamma is predominantly determined by indirect abiotic effects via its components, particularly beta. This highlights that beta and the spatial arrangement of islands are essential to understand insular ecology and evolution.

Nevertheless, many bivalve stocks have dramatically declined, and recruitment failure due to (anthropogenically-) increased predation by mesopredators and loss of facilitation mechanisms have been separately hypothesized as underlying causes. Here, we tested the interactive effects of predation and habitat modification on bivalve recruitment in a large-scale experiment in the Wadden Sea, one of the world's largest intertidal soft-sediment ecosystems. We applied anti-erosion mats to simulate biotic attachment and substrate stabilization by commonly found tubeworm beds, crossed this with addition of adult mussels, and manipulated shrimp and crab predation using exclosures within these treatments. Epibenthic mussel recruits were only found in treatments with manipulated substrates, attached to either the anti-erosion mat or adult mussels. Three out of four endobenthic species were facilitated by the mat, but were inhibited by adult mussels. In contrast, invasive surf-dwelling American razor clams were inhibited by both substrate manipulations, indicating a preference for unstable sediments. These facilitation and inhibition effects, however, only clearly emerged when predators were excluded, demonstrating strong synergistic effects between predation and habitat modification. Our findings suggest that disturbance of trophic interactions and loss of habitat modifying species interactively affect bivalve recruitment dynamics in coastal ecosystems. We conclude that conservation and restoration of bivalves should focus on protecting and restoring internal facilitation mechanisms, and should simultaneously reduce excessive mesopredator predation by restoring natural food web dynamics, including the role of top-predators.

Increased water temperature and accelerated drying may directly affect larval growth, development, and survival, yet the combined effects of these processes on larvae with future climate change remain poorly understood. Increased surface temperatures are projected to warm water and decrease water inputs, leading to earlier and faster wetland drying. So it is often assumed that larvae will experience negative synergistic impacts with combined warming and drying. However, an alternative hypothesis is that warming-induced increases in metabolic rate and aquatic resource availability might compensate for faster drying rates, generating antagonistic larval responses. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to test the individual and interactive effects of pool permanency (permanent vs. temporary) and water temperature (ambient vs. +similar to 3 degrees C) on three anurans with fast-to-slow larval development rates (Great Basin spadefoot [Spea intermontana], Pacific chorus frog [Pseudacris regilla], and northern red-legged frog [Rana aurora]). We found that although tadpoles in warmed pools reached metamorphosis 15-17 days earlier, they did so with little cost (<2 mm) to size, likely due to greater periphyton growth in warmed pools easing drying-induced resource competition. Warming and drying combined to act antagonistically on early growth (P = 0.06) and survival (P = 0.06), meaning the combined impact was less than the sum of the individual impacts. Warming and drying acted additively on time to and size at metamorphosis. These nonsynergistic impacts may result from cotolerance of larvae to warming and drying, as well as warming helping to offset negative impacts of drying. Our results indicate that combined pool warming and drying may not always be harmful for larval amphibians. However, they also demonstrate that antagonistic responses are difficult to predict, which poses a challenge to proactive conservation and management. Our study highlights the importance of considering the nature of multiple stressor interactions as amphibians are exposed to an increasing number of anthropogenic threats.",8,2014,95,4,845,855,10.1890/13-0916.1"McEwan, RW; Pederson, N; Cooper, A; Taylor, J; Watts, R; Hruska, A",Fire and gap dynamics over 300years in an old-growth temperate forest,APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE,Article,Canopy gap; Wildfire; Release detection; Tree-ring; Fire scar; Oak,"Questions What are the long-term patterns of wildfire occurrence and gap dynamics in an old-growth deciduous forest?

Location Lilley Cornett Woods Appalachian Research Station, Southeastern Kentucky, USA. LCW; 37 degrees 05 ' N, 83 degrees 00 ' W. Methods We cross-dated and analysed annually-resolved tree-ring data from 35 tree cross-sections in an old-growth deciduous forest to reconstruct historical fire and canopy disturbance and explore connections among these processes. Canopy disturbance patterns as indicated by tree growth release within this collection [fire history collection: (FHC)] were compared to cores from 26 trees collected in 1983 for the purposes of climate reconstruction [climate collection: (CC)]. Results Initiation dates in the FHC ranged from ca. 1670 to 1925. Thirty-three fire scars were identified from 1678 to 1956. The mean interval between fire events was 9.3yrs, and there were many more fires after 1800 than before that date. Gap dynamics, as reconstructed through growth release detection, were relatively constant through the FHC record and were supported by a similar result in the CC. The mean number of years between detected release events was 5.2yrs. Many individual trees, and the mean growth chronology for the FHC, indicate that many oak trees exhibit growth release after long periods of suppression and, after a final release, exhibit a step-change in growth rate suggesting canopy accession. Conclusions Fire and gap dynamics occurred through much of the last ca. 350yrs in this old-growth forest. There was not evidence to support that these two processes were temporally linked - gap dynamics were ostensibly independent of fire occurrence. Even so, we posit that these two processes may have a synergistic effect on long-term dynamics, wherein fire 'filters' the seedling pool and gap openings provide canopy accession opportunities. We also note several instances where release events are associated with stand-wide growth increases suggesting large-scale canopy accession. These events could influence the overstorey composition of the forest for centuries.",6,2014,17,2,312,322,10.1111/avsc.12060"Morton, ER; Platt, TG; Fuqua, C; Bever, JD",Non-additive costs and interactions alter the competitive dynamics of co-occurring ecologically distinct plasmids,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,Article,plasmid; coevolution; epistasis; competition; adaptation; facultative pathogen,"Plasmids play an important role in shaping bacterial evolution and adaptation to heterogeneous environments. As modular genetic elements that are often conjugative, the selective pressures that act on plasmid-borne genes are distinct from those that act on the chromosome. Many bacteria are co-infected by multiple plasmids that impart niche-specific phenotypes. Thus, in addition to host-plasmid dynamics, interactions between co-infecting plasmids are likely to be important drivers of plasmid population dynamics, evolution and ecology. Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a facultative plant pathogen that commonly harbours two distinct megaplasmids. Virulence depends on the presence of the tumour-inducing (Ti) plasmid, with benefits that are primarily restricted to the disease environment. Here, we demonstrate that a second megaplasmid, the At plasmid, confers a competitive advantage in the rhizosphere. To assess the individual and interactive costs of these plasmids, we generated four isogenic derivatives: plasmidless, pAt only, pTi only and pAtpTi, and performed pairwise competitions under carbon-limiting conditions. These studies reveal a low cost to the virulence plasmid when outside of the disease environment, and a strikingly high cost to the At plasmid. In addition, the costs of pAt and pTi in the same host were significantly lower than predicted based on single plasmid costs, signifying the first demonstration of non-additivity between naturally occurring co-resident plasmids. Based on these empirically demonstrated costs and benefits, we developed a resource-consumer model to generate predictions about the frequencies of these genotypes in relevant environments, showing that non-additivity between co-residing plasmids allows for their stable coexistence across environments.",4,2014,281,1779,,,10.1098/rspb.2013.2173"Orwin, KH; Ostle, N; Wilby, A; Bardgett, RD",Effects of species evenness and dominant species identity on multiple ecosystem functions in model grassland communities,OECOLOGIA,Article,Ecosystem services; Leaching; Multi-functionality; Net ecosystem exchange; Spatial aggregation,"Ecosystems provide multiple services upon which humans depend. Understanding the drivers of the ecosystem functions that support these services is therefore important. Much research has investigated how species richness influences functioning, but we lack knowledge of how other community attributes affect ecosystem functioning. Species evenness, species spatial arrangement, and the identity of dominant species are three attributes that could affect ecosystem functioning, by altering the relative abundance of functional traits and the probability of synergistic species interactions such as facilitation and complementary resource use. We tested the effect of these three community attributes and their interactions on ecosystem functions over a growing season, using model grassland communities consisting of three plant species from three functional groups: a grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), a forb (Plantago lanceolata), and a N-fixing forb (Lotus corniculatus). We measured multiple ecosystem functions that support ecosystem services, including ecosystem gas exchange, water retention, C and N loss in leachates, and plant biomass production. Species evenness and dominant species identity strongly influenced the ecosystem functions measured, but spatial arrangement had few effects. By the end of the growing season, evenness consistently enhanced ecosystem functioning and this effect occurred regardless of dominant species identity. The identity of the dominant species under which the highest level of functioning was attained varied across the growing season. Spatial arrangement had the weakest effect on functioning, but interacted with dominant species identity to affect some functions.

In this study, we investigated this general statement for regulating and supporting services via an assessment of ecosystem functions: climate regulation via carbon sequestration in soil and plant biomass, water cycle and soil erosion regulation via water infiltration in soil, and support for primary production via soil chemical quality and water storage. We tested the hypothesis that patterns of land-cover composition and structure significantly alter ES metrics at two different scales. We surveyed 54 farms in two Amazonian regions of Brazil and Colombia and assessed land-cover composition and structure from remote sensing data (farm scale) from 1990 to 2007. Simple and well-established methods were used to characterize soil and vegetation from five points in each farm (plot scale). Most ES metrics were significantly correlated with land-use (plot scale) and land-cover (farm scale) classifications; however, spatial variability in inherent soil properties, alone or in interaction with land-use or land-cover changes, contributed greatly to variability in ES metrics. Carbon stock in above-ground plant biomass and water infiltration rate decreased from forest to pasture land covers, whereas soil chemical quality and plant-available water storage capacity increased. Land-cover classifications based on structure metrics explained significantly less ES metric variation than those based on composition metrics. Land-cover composition dynamics explained 45 % (P < 0.001) of ES metric variance, 15 % by itself and 30 % in interaction with inherent soil properties.

We explore the consequences that these changes are likely to have on population differentiation of adaptive traits. Superimposed on the spatial redistribution of the species, will there be a redistribution of their genetic variation? We base our predictions on a conceptual framework, whose elements are the extant differentiation, and the predicted divergent evolution of populations along purposely chosen altitudinal/latitudinal gradients. We consider simultaneously phenotypic and genetic divergence, but emphasize genetically driven population differentiation. We illustrate phenotypic and genetic patterns of variation with examples from well-studied northern and southern hemisphere tree genera Quercus and Eucalyptus. Most phenotypic traits show very large in situ clinal variation with variation in altitude or latitude. Genetic clines detected in common gardens usually follow the observed in situ phenotypic clines, reflecting cogradient variation. Rare counter gradients have also been detected, where phenotypic and genetic clines exhibit opposing signs. These patterns suggest that plasticity and selection contributed in most cases synergistically to the extant differentiation. We anticipate that microevolutionary processes will be different along environmental gradients. At the leading edge, availability of newly suitable habitats will trigger migration favouring genotypes equipped with colonists attributes. At the rear edges of the distribution, populations will be submitted to strong selective pressures favouring genotypes capable of withstanding drought and heat stress. Central populations will benefit from the plastic response of trees that will temporarily compensate for the maladaptation, until genetic adaptive variation will be restored by gene flow, mutation or recombination. We make predictions about future differentiation along environmental gradients, by highlighting traits that are likely to diverge, the rate at which differentiation will take place, and the role of gene flow and hybridization. We envisage that parallel selection may maintain differentiation at extant levels, whereas divergent selection will promote substantial differentiation for traits facilitating adaptation to contrasting conditions along the environmental gradient. We anticipate that genetic divergence may occur very rapidly and will be enhanced by the multilocus architecture of most adaptive traits.",7,2014,28,1,22,36,10.1111/1365-2435.12169"Arbuthnott, D; Dutton, EM; Agrawal, AF; Rundle, HD",The ecology of sexual conflict: ecologically dependent parallel evolution of male harm and female resistance in Drosophila melanogaster,ECOLOGY LETTERS,Article,Antagonistic coevolution; ecological divergence; experimental evolution; interlocus sexual conflict; sexual selection,"The prevalence of sexual conflict in nature, along with the potentially stochastic nature of the resulting coevolutionary trajectories, makes it an important driver of phenotypic divergence and speciation that can operate even in the absence of environmental differences. The majority of empirical work investigating sexual conflict's role in population divergence/speciation has therefore been done in uniform environments and any role of ecology has largely been ignored. However, theory suggests that natural selection can constrain phenotypes influenced by sexual conflict. We use replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster adapted to alternative environments to test how ecology influences the evolution of male effects on female longevity. The extent to which males reduce female longevity, as well as female resistance to such harm, both evolved in association with adaptation to the different environments.

Through meta-analysis, we determine narrowing discrimination from an empirical linear relationship between experimental N-15 and N-15 values of prey consumed. The resulting scaled N-15 framework estimated reliable TPs of zooplanktivores to tertiary piscivores congruent with known feeding relationships that radically alters the conventional structure of marine food webs.

Assessing the combined impact of climate change and OA on marine ecosystems is a challenging task. The response of the ecosystem to a single driver can be highly variable and remains still uncertain; additionally the interaction between these can be either synergistic or antagonistic. In this work we use the coupled oceanographic- ecosystem model POLCOMS-ERSEM driven by climate forcing to study the interaction between climate change and OA. We focus in particular on carbonate chemistry, primary and secondary production. The model has been run in three different configurations in order to assess separately the impacts of climate change on net primary production and of OA on the carbonate chemistry, which have been strongly supported by scientific literature, from the impact of biological feedbacks of OA on the ecosystem, whose uncertainty still has to be well constrained. The global mean of the projected decrease of pH at the end of the century is about 0.27 pH units, but the model shows significant interaction among the drivers and high variability in the temporal and spatial response. As a result of this high variability, critical tipping point can be locally and/ or temporally reached: e.g. undersaturation with respect to aragonite is projected to occur in the deeper part of the central North Sea during summer.

Decisions about land-use management in agroecosystems involve spatial and temporal trade-offs. The key scales at which these trades-offs occur are poorly understood for most systems, and quantitative assessments of the services provided by agroecosystems under different combinations of land uses are rare. To fill these knowledge gaps, we measured 12 ecosystem services (ES), including climate regulation, gas regulation, soil stability, nutrient regulation, habitat quality, raw material production, food production, fishing, sports, recreation, education, and social relationships, in seven common land-use types at three spatial scales, i.e., patch, municipality, and landscape, in a riparian floodplain in Spain. We identified the provision of each ES in each land-use type either by direct measurement or from public databases. We analyzed the interactions, i.e., trade-offs and synergies, among ES across land uses and spatial scales and estimated ES provision in several land-use change scenarios. Our results illustrated that each land-use type provides unique bundles of ES and that the spatial scale at which measurements were taken affected the mixture of services. For instance, a land-use type with low provision of services per hectare but with an extensive area can supply more services to the overall landscape than a land-use type supplying higher values of services per hectare but with a smaller extent. Hence, riparian forest supplied the most service of any land-use type at the patch scale, but dry cereal croplands provided the most services across the municipality and landscape because of their large area. We found that most ES should be managed primarily at the patch scale, but food production, fishing, and social relationships were more relevant to manage at the municipality scale. There was great variability in ES interactions across scales with different causes of trade-offs at each scale. We identified more significant synergies among ES than trade-offs. Trade-offs were originated because some services were mutually incompatible within a given land use, whereas the provision of others depended on land-management decisions within a land-use type. Thus, we propose a classification of ES interactions that incorporates societal values as drivers of management decisions along with biophysical factors as likely causes of ES trade-offs and conclude with practical suggestions to reduce trade-offs and to enhance the supply of multiple ES to society.",4,2014,19,1,,,10.5751/ES-06249-190120"Litzow, MA; Mueter, FJ; Hobday, AJ",Reassessing regime shifts in the North Pacific: incremental climate change and commercial fishing are necessary for explaining decadal-scale biological variability,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Article,Alaska; Arctic Oscillation; climate change; fisheries; groundfish; North Pacific Gyre Oscillation; North Pacific Ocean; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; regime shift; salmon,"In areas of the North Pacific that are largely free of overfishing, climate regime shifts - abrupt changes in modes of low-frequency climate variability - are seen as the dominant drivers of decadal-scale ecological variability. We assessed the ability of leading modes of climate variability [Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), Arctic Oscillation (AO), Pacific-North American Pattern (PNA), North Pacific Index (NPI), El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)] to explain decadal-scale (1965-2008) patterns of climatic and biological variability across two North Pacific ecosystems (Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea).

We found that the climate modes alone could not explain ecological variability in the study region. Both linear models (for climate PC1) and generalized additive models (for biology PC1-2) invoking only the climate modes produced residuals with significant temporal trends, indicating that the models failed to capture coherent patterns of ecological variability. However, when the residual climate trend and a time series of commercial fishery catches were used as additional candidate variables, resulting models of biology PC1-2 satisfied assumptions of independent residuals and out-performed models constructed from the climate modes alone in terms of predictive power. As measured by effect size and Akaike weights, the residual climate trend was the most important variable for explaining biology PC1 variability, and commercial catch the most important variable for biology PC2. Patterns of climate sensitivity and exploitation history for taxa strongly associated with biology PC1-2 suggest plausible mechanistic explanations for these modeling results.

Plant growth in Mediterranean high mountains is limited by the double climatic stress of low winter temperatures and summer drought. Elevational shifts in response to climate change may be complex for species whose distribution is constrained by several climatic factors. 2. We used herb-chronology, that is, the analysis of annual rings in the secondary root xylem of perennial forbs, to evaluate life-long factors constraining secondary growth and xylem hydraulic anatomy along an elevational gradient from the upper to the lower distribution limits of the alpine forb Silene ciliata at its southernmost distribution range. 3. Generalized additive models (GAM) showed that annual ring width (RW) in S.ciliata was greatest at intermediate elevations and smallest at the upper and lower limits of its elevational range. In contrast, maximal vessel area (MVA) was greatest at lower elevations. RW responded to climatic conditions in early spring and late summer, suggesting the presence of a bimodal xylogenesis. Structural equation modelling (SEM) indicated a positive influence of MVA on RW in the same year; improved hydraulic efficiency seemed to promote higher secondary growth. 4. The observed greatest secondary growth (RW) and maximal vessel area (MVA) at intermediate and intermediate-low elevations, respectively, contrasts with previous evidence of an improvement in plant reproduction and recruitment with increasing elevation for S.ciliata. However, our results are in agreement with other indicators suggesting that best conditions occur at intermediate elevations, such as better seed quality or larger genome size. 5.

We tested this hypothesis through a paleolimnological approach on three temperate large lakes submitted to rather similar climate warming but varying intensities of analogous local forcings (changes in nutrient inputs and fisheries management practices). Changes in the structure of the cladoceran community were considered as revealing for alterations, over the time, of the pelagic food web. Trajectories of the cladoceran communities were compared among the three study lakes (Lakes Geneva, Bourget, and Annecy) over the last 70-150 years. Generalized additive models were used to develop a hierarchical understanding of the respective roles of local stressors and climate warming in structuring cladoceran communities. The cladoceran communities were not equally affected by climate warming between lakes. In Lake Annecy, which is the most nutrient-limited, the cladoceran community was essentially controlled by local stressors, with very limited impact of climate. In contrast, the more nutrient-loaded Lakes Geneva and Bourget were more sensitive to climate warming, although the magnitude of their responses and the pathways under which climate warming affected the communities varied between the two lakes. Finally, our results demonstrated that lake vulnerability and responses to climate warming are modulated by lake trophic status but can also be altered by fisheries management practices through changes in fish predation pressure.",6,2013,94,12,2767,2780,10.1890/12-1903.1"Merriam, ER; Petty, JT; Strager, MP; Maxwell, AE; Ziemkiewicz, PF",Scenario analysis predicts context-dependent stream response to landuse change in a heavily mined central Appalachian watershed,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,Article,scenario analysis; additive vs interactive effects; coal mining; residential development; landscape indicators,"Scenario analysis has the potential to improve management of aquatic systems throughout the Mountaintop Removal-Valley Fill mining (MTR-VF) region of central Appalachia. However, the extent to which surface mining interacts with other landuse stressors (i.e., cumulative effects) is unclear, and this limits our ability to predict the effects of new mines on physical, chemical, and biological conditions downstream. We tested for additive and interactive effects of landuse change (surface mining, deep mining, and residential development) on water quality (specific conductance and Se), habitat quality, and benthic macroinvertebrates via a uniquely designed watershed-scale assessment of the Coal River, West Virginia (USA). We derived equations for predicting in-stream response to landscape changes and predicted the outcome of a realistic future scenario involving development of 15 permitted mines. Elevated Se concentrations were directly correlated with incremental increases in surface-mining extent. Surface mining, deep mining, and residential development had additive effects on elevated specific conductance and reduced biological condition. We found evidence of a positive interactive effect (stressor antagonism) of deep mining and residential development on biological condition, presumably caused by stream-flow augmentation from deep mines. Landscape context influenced predicted impacts from construction of 15 new mines because of additive and interactive effects of landuse change. New surface mines increased the number of receiving streams exceeding chemical and biological criteria, but a greater proportion of receiving streams exceeded chemical and biological criteria at equivalent levels of new mine development when pre-existing stressors were present. When surface mining was the only stressor, >= 30 or 40% increases in surface mining caused 100% of streams to exceed chemical or biological standards, respectively, whereas in streams stressed by deep mining and residential development, >= 10% additional surface mining caused 100% of streams to exceed chemical and biological standards.

We studied the long-term effects of both small and large herbivores on vegetation structure and species diversity of shortgrass steppe, a perennial semiarid grassland considered marginal habitat for small mammalian herbivores. We hypothesized that 1) large generalist herbivores would affect more abundant species and proportions of litter-bare ground-vegetation cover through non-selective herbivory, 2) small herbivores would affect less common species through selective but limited consumption, and 3) herbivore effects on plant richness would increase with increasing aboveground net primary production (ANPP). Plant community composition was assessed over a 14-year period in pastures grazed at moderate intensities by cattle and in exclosures for large (cattle) and large-plus-small herbivores (additional exclusion of rabbits and rodents). Exclusion of large herbivores affected litter and bare ground and basal cover of abundant, common and uncommon species. Additional exclusion of small herbivores did not affect uncommon components of the plant community, but had indirect effects on abundant species, decreased the cover of the dominant grass Bouteloua gracilis and total vegetation, and increased litter and species diversity. There was no relationship between ANPP and the intensity of effects of either herbivore body size on richness. Exclusion of herbivores of both body sizes had complementary and additive effects which promoted changes in vegetation composition and physiognomy that were linked to increased abundance of tall and decreased abundance of short species. Our findings show that small mammalian herbivores had disproportionately large effects on plant communities relative to their small consumption of biomass.

Using an invertebrate rock pool metacommunity in South Africa as a natural model system, we studied potential interactive effects of disturbance regime and patch isolation on diversity patterns of species with contrasting dispersal modes (passive vs. active dispersal). Isolation and disturbance regime had negative synergistic effects on alpha diversity: both directly, by excluding late-successional species from isolated patches; and indirectly, by modulating establishment success of generalist predators in well-connected patches. Unimodal relationships between isolation and alpha diversity, as predicted by mass effects, were only detected for passive dispersers in frequently disturbed patches and not in active dispersers. For passive dispersers, indications for a positive effect of isolation and a negative effect of disturbance on beta diversity were found, presumably due to differences in deterministic succession and stochastic colonization-extinction dynamics among different patch types.

The rate of initial response, timing of selection limit, and height of the plateau varied significantly between sexes and among the four selected lines. Analyses of litter size and realized selection differentials seem to rule out counterposing natural selection as a cause of the selection limits. Animal-model analyses showed that although the additive genetic variance was significantly lower in selected than control lines, both before and after the limits, the decrease was not sufficient to explain the limits. Moreover, directional selection promoted a negative covariance between additive and maternal genetic variance over the first 10 generations.

LocationNeotropical forests, from Mexico to Argentina. MethodsWe use species occupancy data from 705 forest fragments and 55 adjacent continuous forests nested within 61 landscapes, which we compiled from 96 studies reporting data on patch-scale species composition and patch size/location. Presence-absence data on 19 species functional groups and an index of hunting pressure and matrix type were assigned to each forest patch. We adopted a multilevel analysis, examining SARs and patterns of species retention coupled with the additive effects of hunting pressure and landscape connectivity both across all forest patches and 728 sites nested within 38 landscapes containing four or more sites. ResultsWe uncovered a consistent effect of patch area in explaining primate species richness. Over and above area effects, however, SARs were strongly modulated by levels of hunting pressure at the landscape scale in predicting species occurrence and aggregate assemblage biomass. Matrix type was also a good predictor of both extant species richness and aggregate biomass when only non-hunted sites were considered, with patches in more permeable matrices containing more species. Main conclusionsAlthough the importance of patch area in predicting species persistence is undeniable, we found that SARs were clearly affected by within-patch human exploitation of increasingly isolated primate populations. Both expanding the number of forest reserves and enforcing protection within nominal protected areas are therefore required to ensure the long-term persistence of full primate assemblages.

MethodsWe visited 50 30mx30m randomly sampled plots in 2011 and 2012. A Procrustes analysis of two non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordinations provided information on the temporal change of species assemblages. Variation partitioning revealed the differences in explanatory power of the predictors. We employed a generalized additive model (GAM) to fit the scores of the first ordination axis with a floristic gradient map as a result.

The floristic gradient map resulting from the GAM displayed the spatial distribution of the three main assemblages along the climatic gradient. Edaphic variables added no independent portion to the explanation of the vegetation assemblages, but explained in conjunction with topography and NDVI a considerable amount of the variance. ConclusionsStrong Atlantic easterly winds crossing the Andes can boost plant growth even during a La Nina situation.

They hold great conservation potential and there is demand for assessments of their biodiversity value. Forest disturbance and forest loss often occur together, yet few studies attempt to disentangle their separate effects on biological communities. In the Ecuadorian Choco, a biodiversity hotspot, we sampled understory birds in patches with increasing levels of disturbance (old-growth, selectively-logged, and secondary forests) within contiguous forest and in fragments. Species richness increased with disturbance but decreased with habitat loss, with a 75% reduction in endemic and threatened species in fragments compared to contiguous forest. This reduction in richness was most pronounced in secondary forest fragments, suggesting that disturbance and habitat loss interact synergistically to maximally reduce avian biodiversity. Species composition was strongly affected by habitat loss and, to a lesser extent, disturbance, with forest fragments and secondary forests presenting distinct communities dominated by generalists with medium-to-low sensitivity to anthropogenic disturbance and reduced proportions of endemics and endangered species. Capture rates also decreased (non-significantly) with habitat loss, and the relative abundance of dietary guilds varied in response to both habitat loss and disturbance. Our study shows that regenerating patches surrounded by contiguous forest can sustain high biodiversity levels and, when past habitat disturbance is mild, present similar communities to old-growth forests. In contrast, forest loss caused reductions in richness (especially in more disturbed patches), profound changes in community composition, and loss of species of conservation concern. These results underscore the importance of considering landscape context when evaluating the conservation value of disturbed forests. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The dominant tree, coast redwood (fire resistant without negative disease impacts), experienced unexpected synergistic increases in mortality when fire and disease co-occurred. The increased mortality risk, more than fourfold at the peak of the effect, was not predictable from impacts of either disturbance alone.

Few studies have investigated how they operate synergistically to alter trophic interactions among indigenous and nonindigenous species in invaded ecosystems. We experimentally manipulated a suite of interacting invasive mammals, including top predators (cat Felis catus, ferret Mustela furo, stoat M. erminea), herbivores (rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus, hare Lepus europaeus), and an insectivore (hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus occidentalis), and measured their effects on indigenous lizards and invertebrates and on an invasive mesopredator (house mouse Mus musculus). The work was carried out in a grassland/shrubland ecosystem that had been subjected to two types of habitat modification (widespread introduction of high-seed-producing pasture species, and areas of land use intensification by fertilization and livestock grazing). We also quantified food productivity for indigenous and invasive fauna by measuring pasture biomass, as well as seed and fruit production by grasses and shrubs. Indigenous fauna did not always increase following top-predator suppression: lizards increased on one of two sites; invertebrates did not increase on either site. Mesopredator release of mice was evident at the site where lizards did not increase, suggesting negative effects of mice on lizard populations. High mouse abundance occurred only on the predator-suppression site with regular production of pasture seed, indicating that this food resource was the main driver of mouse populations. Removal of herbivores increased pasture and seed production, which further enhanced ecological release of mice, particularly where pasture swards were overtopped by shrubs. An effect of landscape supplementation was also evident where nearby fertilized pastures boosted rabbit numbers and the associated top predators. Other studies have shown that both suppression of invasive predators and retiring land from grazing can benefit indigenous species, but our results suggest that the ensuing vegetation changes and complex interactions among invasive species can block recovery of indigenous fauna vulnerable to mesopredators. Top-down and bottom-up ecological release of mesopredators and landscape supplementation of top predators are key processes to consider when managing invaded communities in complex landscapes.",10,2013,23,7,1707,1721,10.1890/12-1958.1"Emaresi, G; Ducrest, AL; Bize, P; Richter, H; Simon, C; Roulin, A",Pleiotropy in the melanocortin system: expression levels of this system are associated with melanogenesis and pigmentation in the tawny owl (Strix aluco),MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,Article,adaptation; birds; development and evolution; convertase; ecological genetics; PC1; 3; PC2; protease,"The adaptive function of melanin-based coloration is a long-standing debate. A recent genetic model suggested that pleiotropy could account for covariations between pigmentation, behaviour, morphology, physiology and life history traits. We explored whether the expression levels of genes belonging to the melanocortin system (MC1R, POMC, PC1/3, PC2 and the antagonist ASIP), which have many pleiotropic effects, are associated with melanogenesis (through variation in the expression of the genes MITF, SLC7A11, TYR, TYRP1) and in turn melanin-based coloration. We considered the tawny owl (Strix aluco) because individuals vary continuously from light to dark reddish, and thus, colour variation is likely to stem from differences in the levels of gene expression. We measured gene expression in feather bases collected in nestlings at the time of melanin production. As expected, the melanocortin system was associated with the expression of melanogenic genes and pigmentation. Offspring of darker reddish fathers expressed PC1/3 to lower levels but tended to express PC2 to higher levels. The convertase enzyme PC1/3 cleaves the POMC prohormone to obtain ACTH, while the convertase enzyme PC2 cleaves ACTH to produce -melanin-stimulating hormone (-MSH). ACTH regulates glucocorticoids, hormones that modulate stress responses, while -MSH induces eumelanogenesis. We therefore conclude that the melanocortin system, through the convertase enzymes PC1/3 and PC2, may account for part of the interindividual variation in melanin-based coloration in nestling tawny owls. Pleiotropy may thus account for the covariation between phenotypic traits involved in social interactions (here pigmentation) and life history, morphology, behaviour and physiology.",10,2013,22,19,4915,4930,10.1111/mec.12438"Feng, MB; Li, Y; Qu, RJ; Wang, LS; Wang, ZY","Oxidative stress biomarkers in freshwater fish Carassius auratus exposed to decabromodiphenyl ether and ethane, or their mixture",ECOTOXICOLOGY,Article,Flame retardants; Antioxidant enzymes; Lipid peroxidation; Combined effect; Fish liver,"Decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) and its commercial alternative decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) are two structurally similar brominated flame retardants, with evidence of their ubiquitous existence in aquatic ecosystems.

Terrestrial food webs are woven from complex interactions, often underpinned by plant-mediated interactions between herbivores and higher trophic groups. Below-and above-ground herbivores can influence one another via induced changes to a shared host plant, potentially shaping the wider community. However, empirical evidence linking laboratory observations to natural field populations has so far been elusive. 2. This study investigated how root-feeding weevils (Otiorhynchus sulcatus) influence different feeding guilds of herbivore (phloem-feeding aphids, Cryptomyzus galeopsidis, and leaf-chewing sawflies, Nematus olfaciens) in both controlled and field conditions. 3. We hypothesized that root herbivore-induced changes in plant nutrients (C, N, P and amino acids) and defensive compounds (phenolics) would underpin the interactions between root and foliar herbivores, and ultimately populations of natural enemies of the foliar herbivores in the field. 4. Weevils increased field populations of aphids by ca. 700%, which was followed by an increase in the abundance of aphid natural enemies. Weevils increased the proportion of foliar essential amino acids, and this change was positively correlated with aphid abundance, which increased by 90% on plants with weevils in controlled experiments. 5. In contrast, sawfly populations were 77% smaller during mid-June and adult emergence delayed by > 14 days on plants with weevils. In controlled experiments, weevils impaired sawfly growth by 18%, which correlated with 35% reductions in leaf phosphorus caused by root herbivory, a previously unreported mechanism for above-ground-below-ground herbivore interactions. 6. This represents a clear demonstration of root herbivores affecting foliar herbivore community composition and natural enemy abundance in the field via two distinct plant-mediated nutritional mechanisms.

Here, we hypothesize that positive litter mixture effects occur via complementary resource use, when litter species complement each other in terms of resource quality for detritivores. To investigate this, monocultures and mixtures of two leaf litter species varying in quality were allowed to decompose with and without a single macro-detritivore species (the terrestrial woodlice Oniscus asellus). Resource quality of the mixture was assessed by the mean concentration, the dissimilarity in absolute and relative concentrations, and the covariance between nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and calcium (Ca) supply. Our results clearly show that litter mixing effects were driven by differences in their resource quality for detritivores. In particular, complementary supply of N and P was a major driver of litter mixing effects. Interestingly, litter mixing effects caused by the addition of woodlice were predominantly driven by N dissimilarity, whereas in their absence, increased P concentration was the main driver of litter mixing effects. These results show that ultimately, litter diversity effects on decomposition may be driven by complementary resource use of the whole decomposer community (i.e., microbes and macro-detritivores).",11,2013,173,1,269,280,10.1007/s00442-012-2588-1"Vogel, A; Eisenhauer, N; Weigelt, A; Scherer-Lorenzen, M",Plant diversity does not buffer drought effects on early-stage litter mass loss rates and microbial properties,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Article,biodiversity loss; climate change; decomposition; drought; grassland; litter mass loss; soil processes; the Jena Experiment,"Human activities are decreasing biodiversity and changing the climate worldwide. Both global change drivers have been shown to affect ecosystem functioning, but they may also act in concert in a non-additive way. We studied early-stage litter mass loss rates and soil microbial properties (basal respiration and microbial biomass) during the summer season in response to plant species richness and summer drought in a large grassland biodiversity experiment, the Jena Experiment, Germany. In line with our expectations, decreasing plant diversity and summer drought decreased litter mass loss rates and soil microbial properties. In contrast to our hypotheses, however, this was only true for mass loss of standard litter (wheat straw) used in all plots, and not for plant community-specific litter mass loss. We found no interactive effects between global change drivers, that is, drought reduced litter mass loss rates and soil microbial properties irrespective of plant diversity. High mass loss rates of plant community-specific litter and low responsiveness to drought relative to the standard litter indicate that soil microbial communities were adapted to decomposing community-specific plant litter material including lower susceptibility to dry conditions during summer months. Moreover, higher microbial enzymatic diversity at high plant diversity may have caused elevated mass loss of standard litter. Our results indicate that plant diversity loss and summer drought independently impede soil processes. However, soil decomposer communities may be highly adapted to decomposing plant community-specific litter material, even in situations of environmental stress.

We conducted an 11-week factorial experiment to examine the effects of temperature (22 degrees C or 27 degrees C), moisture (wet or dry), and atrazine (an herbicide; 0, 4, 40, 400 g/L exposure as embryos and larvae) on the survival, growth, behavior, and foraging rates of postmetamorphic streamside salamanders (Ambystoma barbouri), a species of conservation concern. The tested climatic conditions were between the critical maxima and minima of streamside salamanders; thus, this experiment quantified the long-term effects of climate change within the noncritical range of this species. Despite a suite of behavioral adaptations to warm and dry conditions (e.g., burrowing, refuge use, huddling with conspecifics, and a reduction in activity), streamside salamanders exhibited significant loss of mass and significant mortality in all but the cool and moist conditions, which were closest to the climatic conditions in which they are most active in nature. A temperature of 27 degrees C represented a greater mortality risk than dry conditions; death occurred rapidly at this temperature and more gradually under cool and dry conditions. Foraging decreased under dry conditions, which suggests there were opportunity costs to water conservation. Exposure to the herbicide atrazine additively decreased water-conserving behaviors, foraging efficiency, mass, and time to death. Hence, the hypothesis that moderate climate change can cause population declines is even more plausible under scenarios with multiple stressors.

Methods The occurrence of S. trutta and variables of climate, land cover and stream topography were assigned to stream reaches. Data obtained were used to build correlative species distribution models (SDMs) and forecasts for future decades (2020s, 2050s and 2080s) under the A1b emissions scenario, using four statistical techniques (generalised linear models, generalised additive models, random forest, and multivariate adaptive regression). Results The SDMs showed an excellent performance. Climate was a better predictor than stream topography, while land cover characteristics were not necessary to improve performance.

In social insects, compounds on the body surface represent a particularly interesting trait, because they comprise different compound classes that are involved in different functions, such as communication, recognition and protection, all of which can be differentially affected by evolutionary processes. Here, we investigate the widely unknown and possibly antagonistic influence of phylogenetic and environmental factors on the composition of the cuticular chemistry of tropical stingless bees. We chose stingless bees because some species are unique in expressing not only self-produced compounds, but also compounds that are taken up from the environment. By relating the cuticular chemistry of 40 bee species from all over the world to their molecular phylogeny and geographical occurrence, we found that distribution patterns of different groups of compounds were differentially affected by genetic relatedness and biogeography. The ability to acquire environmental compounds was, for example, highly correlated with the bees' phylogeny and predominated in evolutionarily derived species. Owing to the presence of environmentally derived compounds, those species further expressed a higher chemical and thus functional diversity. In Old World species, chemical similarity of both environmentally derived and self-produced compounds was particularly high among sympatric species, even when they were less related to each other than to allopatric species, revealing a strong environmental effect even on largely genetically determined compounds. Thus, our findings do not only reveal an unexpectedly strong influence of the environment on the cuticular chemistry of stingless bees, but also demonstrate that even within one morphological trait (an insect's cuticular profile), different components (compound classes) can be differentially affected by different drivers (relatedness and biogeography), depending on the functional context.",6,2013,280,1762,,,10.1098/rspb.2013.0680"le Roux, PC; Virtanen, R; Luoto, M",Geomorphological disturbance is necessary for predicting fine-scale species distributions,ECOGRAPHY,Article,,"Disturbances related to geomorphological processes are frequent, widespread and often intense at high latitudes and altitudes, affecting the fine-scale distribution of many plant species. While the inclusion of physical disturbances into models of species geographic ranges is widely recommended, no studies have yet tested the utility of field-quantified geomorphological disturbances for terrestrial species distribution modelling. Here we apply generalized additive models and boosted regression trees to examine if the explicit inclusion of terrestrial and fluvial geomorphological variables alters species distribution models for 154 vascular plant, bryophyte and lichen species in north European mountain tundra. The inclusion of these disturbances significantly improved both the explanatory and predictive power of distribution models, with consistent results for all three species groups. Spatial distribution predictions changed considerably for some species after the inclusion of disturbance variables, with fluvial disturbances generating strongly linear features for species influenced by erosion or sediment deposition. As a consequence, models incorporating geomorphological variables produced markedly more refined distribution maps than simpler models. Predictions of species distributions will thus benefit strongly from the inclusion of fine-scale geomorphological variables, particularly in areas of active earth surface processes, enabling more accurate forecasting of future species ranges under changing conditions.",7,2013,36,7,800,808,10.1111/j.1600-0587.2012.07922.x"Patsias, K; Bruelheide, H",Climate change - Bad news for montane forest herb layer species?,ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Article,Calamagrostis villosa; Common garden experiment; Gap dynamics; Phenotypic plasticity; Trientalis europaea; Vaccinium myrtillus,"Global warming presents a threat to plant species distributed at montane or alpine altitudes if the topography does not allow upward shifts in distribution ranges. Nevertheless, the species might also benefit from increasing temperatures and secondary effects on dominant species (e.g. bark beetle outbreaks or summer drought affecting the canopy species). As a consequence, disturbance frequency in montane forests might increase and light availability for herb layer species will increase. We addressed these interactions in a common garden experiment in Central Germany at different altitudes, representing cold and moist vs. warm and dry conditions. We investigated three montane species with different life forms, including a herb (Trientalis europaea), a grass (Calamagrostis villosa) and a dwarf shrub (Vaccinium myrtillus) under three shading treatments (3%, 28% and 86% of full sunlight). We hypothesized that montane species are at a disadvantage in the lowland, with the dwarf shrub suffering more than the grass. Furthermore, we hypothesized an antagonistic interaction of increased temperature and increased light conditions. While T europaea and v myrtillus showed only slightly responses to low altitude conditions, C villosa displayed a nearly fifteen fold increase in biomass production, despite higher observed herbivory levels in the lowland. We failed to show an antagonistic effect of increased temperature and increased light availability, as all study species suffered from deep shade conditions and grew best under full light conditions at both sites. In conclusion, both improved temperature and light conditions might be principally beneficial for the investigated boreal species, in particular for the grass species C villosa.

This is because life history and personality have become implied as part of integrative pace-of-life syndromes. Immune defense is one of the traits that have been suggested to associate with personality traits, such as boldness, mainly because behavioral types may differ in parasite encounter rates. Here, we quantified the narrow-sense heritabilities (h(2) V-A/(V-A V-R)) and genetic (r(A)) and phenotypic (r(P)) correlations between 2 measures of behavior (overall boldness and defreezing, i.e., recovery from disturbance-induced immobility), 1 measure of immune function (encapsulation response), and 2 life-history traits (body mass and maturation time) using the western stutter-trilling cricket, Gryllus integer. All nonbehavioral traits showed strong heritabilities (range: encapsulation response and life-history: h(2) 0.420.84), whereas behaviors were only marginally heritable (h(2) 0.060.11). Boldness and encapsulation were positively associated, and defreezing and body mass were negatively associated phenotypically, whereas only defreezing was positively genetically correlated with encapsulation. However, the lack of significant additive genetic variation in defreezing suggests that the genetic correlation may be an artifact and therefore, that there were only environmentally induced phenotypic correlations between behaviors and other measured traits. Life-history traits and encapsulation were positively phenotypically associated and these associations were mostly genetically underpinned. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that life history is structured in an evolutionarily significant pace-of-life syndrome, but suggest that behavior does not intrinsically integrate with such life-history variation.",7,2013,24,4,935,941,10.1093/beheco/art014"Byrne, M; Ho, MA; Koleits, L; Price, C; King, CK; Virtue, P; Tilbrook, B; Lamarek, M",Vulnerability of the calcifying larval stage of the Antarctic sea urchin Sterechinus neumayeri to near-future ocean acidification and warming,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Article,climate change; development; Eastern Antarctica; echinopluteus; pCO 2; sea urchin; temperature,"Stenothermal polar benthic marine invertebrates are highly sensitive to environmental perturbations but little is known about potential synergistic effects of concurrent ocean warming and acidification on development of their embryos and larvae. We examined the effects of these stressors on development to the calcifying larval stage in the Antarctic sea urchin Sterechinus neumayeri in embryos reared in present and future (2100+) ocean conditions from fertilization. Embryos were reared in 2 temperature (ambient: -1.0 degrees C, + 2 degrees C:1.0 degrees C) and 3 pH (ambient: pH 8.0, -0.2-0.4 pH units: 7.8,7.6) levels. Principle coordinates analysis on five larval metrics showed a significant effect of temperature and pH on the pattern of growth. Within each temperature, larvae were separated by pH treatment, a pattern primarily influenced by larval arm and body length. Growth was accelerated by temperature with a 20-28% increase in postoral (PO) length at +2 degrees C across all pH levels. Growth was strongly depressed by reduced pH with a 8-19% decrease in PO length at pH 7.6-7.8 at both temperatures. The boost in growth caused by warming resulted in larvae that were larger than would be observed if acidification was examined in the absence of warming. However, there was no significant interaction between these stressors. The increase in left-right asymmetry and altered body allometry indicated that decreased pH disrupted developmental patterning and acted as a teratogen (agent causing developmental malformation). Decreased developmental success with just a 2 degrees C warming indicates that development in S. neumayeri is particularly sensitive to increased temperature. Increased temperature also altered larval allometry. Altered body shape impairs swimming and feeding in echinoplutei. In the absence of adaptation, it appears that the larval phase may be a bottleneck for survivorship of S. neumayeri in a changing ocean in a location where poleward migration to escape inhospitable conditions is not possible.",15,2013,19,7,2264,2275,10.1111/gcb.12190"Stephens, AEA; Srivastava, DS; Myers, JH",Strength in numbers?

In particular, a predictive framework is lacking for when to expect enemies to have independent versus non-independent effects on their host plant. This is problematic for weed biological control programmes where multiple enemies are frequently released with the possibility of antagonistic interactions that may reduce control. Here, we conduct an analysis of 74 unique plant-enemy-enemy combinations from 51 studies to determine the frequency of non-independent effects of natural enemies on host plant performance, and test a number of a priori predictions for determinants of independent and antagonistic effects of multiple enemies. For three-quarters of plant response measurements, enemies had independent effects on plant performance. In most of the remainder, multiple enemies led to less reduction in performance than that predicted from each enemy alone. Antagonistic effects occurred when enemies attacked the same plant part concurrently or attacked plant reproductive structures. These two predictors explained why antagonistic effects were particularly prevalent for weeds, plants in the family Asteraceae and enemies in the order Diptera.

For example, DD underpins the idea of additive versus compensatory mortality and is a tenet in the paradigm of resource limitation and regulation. Yet the prevalence and importance of DD remains disputed in most organisms, including ducks, which are focal in game management, conservation and zoonotic diseases. Based on 154 data entries from 54 studies in the peer-reviewed literature, we here synthesize and evaluate the prevalence of DD in breeding ducks in relation to (1) species and guild (dabbling versus diving ducks), (2) stage in the breeding cycle (nesting, duckling, recruitment) or, alternatively, in terms of population dynamics, (3) study type (descriptive/non-manipulative versus experimental), (4) continent (Europe versus North America), (5) spatial level (wetland, landscape, regional, continental) and (6) biome (tundra, boreal, nemoral, prairie, mediterranean). One conclusion from this review is that it is difficult to find general patterns about the prevalence of DD unless data are broken down to subsets, for example, to stage or spatial level. With respect to stage, DD effects occur at all stages of the breeding cycle. During the nesting and duckling stages, the frequency of cases detecting versus not detecting DD is roughly the same. However, in cases referring to the recruitment stage, i.e. to survival of fledged ducks until 1 year old at the most, DD was the rule, suggesting that DD processes may operate mainly outside the breeding season. Further subdivision of data shows that spatial scale is important to the prevalence of DD in nesting ducks-rare on the wetland level and more common on higher spatial levels. In studies of population dynamics (i.e. based on time series data only), DD was more often found in diving than in dabbling ducks. This corroborates previous suggestions that dabbling ducks largely should be considered as r-selected species, in contrast to more K-selected diving ducks, which start to reproduce at an older age and often breed in more stable wetland environments where resources may be easier to track and populations thus often are closer to carrying capacity. However, the picture of DD in ducks is far from complete, and knowledge gaps for future studies to address include: (a) data from Russia, which holds a large part of the breeding ducks in the Northern hemisphere, (b) experimental studies on more species to separate density-dependent factors from other drivers of population change and to tease apart spatial and temporal interactions in the underlying processes, (c) time series analyses addressing population dynamics, especially from outside North America, (d) studies relating duck numbers to limiting resources, which arguably is the most relevant measure of density, (e) the timing of DD processes in relation to harvest and natural mortality.",7,2013,59,3,305,321,10.1007/s10344-013-0716-9"Biere, A; Tack, AJM","Evolutionary adaptation in three-way interactions between plants, microbes and arthropods",FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,Review,co-evolution; genotype-by-environment interactions; local adaptation; plantinsect interactions; plantmicrobearthropod interactions; plantpathogen interactions; symbionts; tripartite interactions,"Evolutionary adaptations in interactions between plants, microbes and arthropods are generally studied in interactions that involve only two of these groups, that is, plants and microbes, plants and arthropods or arthropods and microbes.

To understand how P. halocryophilus Or1 remains active under the subzero and osmotically dynamic conditions that characterize its native permafrost habitat, we investigated the genome, cell physiology and transcriptomes of growth at - 15 degrees C and 18% NaCl compared with optimal (25 degrees C) temperatures. Subzero growth coincides with unusual cell envelope features of encrustations surrounding cells, while the cytoplasmic membrane is significantly remodeled favouring a higher ratio of saturated to branched fatty acids. Analyses of the 3.4Mbp genome revealed that a suite of cold and osmotic-specific adaptive mechanisms are present as well as an amino acid distribution favouring increased flexibility of proteins. Genomic redundancy within 17% of the genome could enable P. halocryophilus Or1 to exploit isozyme exchange to maintain growth under stress, including multiple copies of osmolyte uptake genes (Opu and Pro genes). Isozyme exchange was observed between the transcriptome data sets, with selective upregulation of multi-copy genes involved in cell division, fatty acid synthesis, solute binding, oxidative stress response and transcriptional regulation. The combination of protein flexibility, resource efficiency, genomic plasticity and synergistic adaptation likely compensate against osmotic and cold stresses. These results suggest that non-spore forming P. halocryophilus Or1 is specifically suited for active growth in its Arctic permafrost habitat (ambient temp.

Beta diversity patterns are originated from two distinct processes: the replacement (or turnover) of species and the loss (or gain) of species leading to richness differences. Nested distributional patterns are generally thought to have a component deriving from beta diversity which is independent of replacement processes. Quantification of these phenomena is often made by calculating a measure of beta diversity, and the resulting value being subsequently partitioned into a contribution by species replacement plus a fraction shared by beta diversity and nestedness. Three methods have been recently proposed for such partitioning, all of them based on pairwise comparisons of sites. In this paper, the performance of these methods was evaluated on theoretical grounds and tested by a simulation study in which different gradients of dissimilarity, with known degrees of species replacement and species loss, were created. Performance was also tested using empirical data addressing land-use induced changes in endemic arthropod communities of the Terceira Island in the Azores. We found that the partitioning of cc (dissimilarity in terms of the Jaccard index) into two additive fractions, -3 (dissimilarity due to species replacement) plus rich (dissimilarity due to richness differences) reflects the species replacement and species loss processes across the simulated gradients in an ecologically and mathematically meaningful way, whilst the other two methods lack mathematical consistency and prove conceptually self-contradictory. Moreover, the first method identified a selective local extinction process for endemic arthropods, triggered by land-use changes, while the latter two methods overweighted the replacement component and led to false conclusions. Their basic flaw derives from the fact that the proposed replacement and nestedness components (deemed to account for species loss) are not scaled in the same way as the measure that accounts for the total dissimilarity (SOrensen and Jaccard indices). We therefore recommend the use of cc=-3+rich, since its components are scaled in the same units and their responses are proportional to the replacement and the gain/loss of species.",17,2013,122,6,825,834,10.1111/j.1600-0706.2012.20980.x"Darling, ES; McClanahan, TR; Cote, IM",Life histories predict coral community disassembly under multiple stressors,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Article,climate change; cumulative effects; fishing; Kenya; marine reserves; scleractinian corals; stressor interactions; synergy,"Climate change is reshaping biological communities against a background of existing human pressure. Evaluating the impacts of multiple stressors on community dynamics can be particularly challenging in species-rich ecosystems, such as coral reefs. Here, we investigate whether life-history strategies and cotolerance to different stressors can predict community responses to fishing and temperature-driven bleaching using a 20-year time series of coral assemblages in Kenya. We found that the initial life-history composition of coral taxa largely determined the impacts of bleaching and coral loss. Prior to the 1998 bleaching event, coral assemblages within no-take marine reserves were composed of three distinct life histories competitive, stress-tolerant and weedy and exhibited strong declines following bleaching with limited subsequent recovery. In contrast, fished reefs had lower coral cover, fewer genera and were composed of stress-tolerant and weedy corals that were less affected by bleaching over the long term. Despite these general patterns, we found limited evidence for cotolerance as coral genera and life histories were variable in their sensitivities to fishing and bleaching. Overall, fishing and bleaching have reduced coral diversity and led to altered coral communities of survivor' species with stress-tolerant and weedy life histories.

This relation should be driven by differing relative roles of the main fire drivers (weather and fuel) along the productivity gradient. However, the full intermediate fireproductivity model across all world ecosystems remains to be validated. Location The entire globe, excluding Antarctica. Methods To test the intermediate fireproductivity hypothesis, we use the world ecoregions as a spatial unit and, for each ecoregion, we compiled remotely sensed fire activity, climate, biomass and productivity information. The regression coefficient between monthly MODIS fire activity and monthly maximum temperature in each ecoregion was considered an indicator of the sensitivity of fire to high temperatures in the ecoregion. We used linear and generalized additive models to test for the linear and humped relationships. Results Fire occurs in most ecoregions. Fire activity peaked in tropical grasslands and savannas, and significantly decreased towards the extremes of the productivity gradient. Both the sensitivity of fire to high temperatures and above-ground biomass increased monotonically with productivity. In other words, fire activity in low-productivity ecosystems is not driven by warm periods and is limited by low biomass; in contrast, in high-productivity ecosystems fire is more sensitive to high temperatures, and in these ecosystems, the available biomass for fires is high. Main conclusion The results support the intermediate fireproductivity model on a global scale and suggest that climatic warming may affect fire activity differently depending on the productivity of the region. Fire regimes in productive regions are vulnerable to warming (drought-driven fire regime changes), while in low-productivity regions fire activity is more vulnerable to fuel changes (fuel-driven fire regime changes).",25,2013,22,6,728,736,10.1111/geb.12043"Williams, SL; Bracken, MES; Jones, E",Additive effects of physical stress and herbivores on intertidal seaweed biodiversity,ECOLOGY,Article,"biodiversity; Bodega Marine Reserve, California; herbivores; nutrients; physical stress; rocky intertidal zone; seaweed; tidal height; wave exposure","Patterns in rocky intertidal seaweed biodiversity influence the resilience and functioning of these important primary producer communities.

Charophytes also appeared spontaneously. M. spicatum was the species that dominated both lagoons and almost completely covered their surface. M. spicatum reached a high biomass and displayed a seasonal pattern, declining during the cold season and reappearing in the spring. No submerged vegetation was observed in the lagoons from 2011 onward. The major purpose of the present study was to elucidate the factors that caused the total disappearance and prevented the regeneration of submerged vegetation cover in both lagoons. Such factors may include negative biotic relationships such as those related to the presence of fish and crayfish, waterfowl grazing, phytoplankton and epiphytic development that causes shading and abiotic factors such as water nutrient concentration. Three different types (treatments) of 1-m(2). exclosures were set up and planted with macrophyte cultures that formed 3 different assemblages: Chara hispida alone, a mixture of C vulgaris, C baltica and Nitella hyalina and a mixture of higher plants (M. spicatum, C demersum and Potamogeton pectinatus). The ""Open"" type of exclosure permitted the entrance of fish, crayfish, and birds. The ""Lateral"" exclosure prevented the entry of fish. The ""Closed"" exclosure also prevented bird grazing. To determine the potential of the seed sediment bank to regenerate submerged vegetation, we investigated lagoon sediments (i) to quantify seeds and (ii) to examine seed germination. The results indicate that there is not a sufficiently large reservoir of phanerogam seeds in the lagoon sediments to recover vegetation by germination. The ""Closed"" exclosures allowed the growth of all species in spite of the intense development of periphyton on macrophyte tissues and filamentous algae, which reduced light availability by up to 45%. The ""Lateral"" exclosures had a lower development of macrophytes. In the ""Open"" exclosures, almost no macrophytes were detected 3 weeks after planting. Water chemistry (P and N content) did not limit the development of the tested macrophyte species but did appear to negatively affect charophytes in one of the lagoons. The deleterious effect of exotic fauna (particularly carps and crayfish) in combination with the high herbivory pressure by waterfowl, primarily during the periods when the rice fields surrounding the lagoons were dry, were the major factors that acted in a negative synergistic manner to prevent the recolonisation of the vegetation currently in the lagoons. A procedure to eradicate exotic fish and crayfish is required prior to any type of restoration effort involving the plantation of submerged macrophytes. More areas with permanent submerged vegetation in the Natural Park are required to decrease herbivory pressure. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

New perspectives on the universality of senescence,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Review,ageing; antagonistic pleiotropy; comparative plant demography; disposable soma; dormancy; longevity; mutation accumulation; oxidative stress; plant development and life-history traits; senescence,"Senescence, the physiological decline that results in decreasing survival and/or reproduction with age, remains one of the most perplexing topics in biology. Most theories explaining the evolution of senescence (i.e. antagonistic pleiotropy, accumulation of mutations, disposable soma) were developed decades ago. Even though these theories have implicitly focused on unitary animals, they have also been used as the foundation from which the universality of senescence across the tree of life is assumed. Surprisingly, little is known about the general patterns, causes and consequences of whole-individual senescence in the plant kingdom. There are important differences between plants and most animals, including modular architecture, the absence of early determination of cell lines between the soma and gametes, and cellular division that does not always shorten telomere length. These characteristics violate the basic assumptions of the classical theories of senescence and therefore call the generality of senescence theories into question. This Special Feature contributes to the field of whole-individual plant senescence with five research articles addressing topics ranging from physiology to demographic modelling and comparative analyses. These articles critically examine the basic assumptions of senescence theories such as age-specific gene action, the evolution of senescence regardless of the organism's architecture and environmental filtering, and the role of abiotic agents on mortality trajectories. Synthesis. Understanding the conditions under which senescence has evolved is of general importance across biology, ecology, evolution, conservation biology, medicine, gerontology, law and social sciences. The question why is senescence universal or why is it not?' naturally calls for an evolutionary perspective. Senescence is a puzzling phenomenon, and new insights will be gained by uniting methods, theories and observations from formal demography, animal demography and plant population ecology.

However, the converse is that generation of natural events (such as hurricanes, severe storms and tsunamis) can have devastating impacts on coastal populations, while pollution of the seas by pathogens and toxic waste can cause illness and death in humans and animals. Harmful effects from biogenic toxins produced by algal blooms (HABs) and from the pathogens associated with microbial pollution are also a health hazard in seafood and from direct contact with water. The overall global burden of human disease caused by sewage pollution of coastal waters has been estimated at 4 million lost person-years annually. Finally, the impacts of all of these issues will be exacerbated by climate change. A holistic systems approach is needed. It must consider whole ecosystems, and their sustainability, such as integrated coastal zone management, is necessary to address the highly interconnected scientific challenges of increased human population pressure, pollution and over-exploitation of food (and other) resources as drivers of adverse ecological, social and economic impacts. There is also an urgent and critical requirement for effective and integrated public health solutions to be developed through the formulation of politically and environmentally meaningful policies. The research community required to address ""Oceans & Human Health"" in Europe is currently very fragmented, and recognition by policy makers of some of the problems, outlined in the list of challenges above, is limited. Nevertheless, relevant key policy issues for governments worldwide include the reduction of the burden of disease (including the early detection of emerging pathogens and other threats) and improving the quality of the global environment. Failure to effectively address these issues will impact adversely on efforts to alleviate poverty, sustain the availability of environmental goods and services and improve health and social and economic stability; and thus, will impinge on many policy decisions, both nationally and internationally. Knowledge exchange (KE) will be a key element of any ensuing research. KE will facilitate the integration of biological, medical, epidemiological, social and economic disciplines, as well as the emergence of synergies between seemingly unconnected areas of science and socio-economic issues, and will help to leverage knowledge transfer across the European Union (EU) and beyond. An integrated interdisciplinary systems approach is an effective way to bring together the appropriate groups of scientists, social scientists, economists, industry and other stakeholders with the policy formulators in order to address the complexities of interfacial problems in the area of environment and human health. The Marine Board of the European Science Foundation Working Group on ""Oceans and Human Health"" has been charged with developing a position paper on this topic with a view to identifying the scientific, social and economic challenges and making recommendations to the EU on policy-relevant research and development activities in this arena.

However, in many cases, food-web and habitat complexity also change with abiotic stress or disturbance, potentially altering patterns of species interactions across environmental gradients. We used a combination of field assays and mesocosm experiments to investigate how disturbance from desiccation moderates top-down control of prey by predators across a gradient of pond duration in New Zealand. Field manipulations of predator abundance in ponds led to an unexpected decrease in the top-down control of prey biomass by predatory invertebrates as pond duration increased (decreasing abiotic stress). Predatory fish, which are restricted to permanent ponds, had negligible effects on prey biomass. Mesocosm experiments further indicated the consumptive effects of fish are weak; a result that cannot be explained by an increase in physical habitat refugia in relatively more permanent ponds. Manipulations of invertebrate predator diversity in mesocosms (both substitutive and additive treatments), and the addition of olfactory fish cues, revealed that strong non-consumptive effects of fish reduced predation by predatory invertebrates, and these effects overwhelmed the positive influence of invertebrate predator diversity on prey consumption. These results suggest that decreases in top-down control with increasing pond permanence are likely a result of non-consumptive effects of fish weakening predation by invertebrate predators in the more complex food webs of permanent ponds. Therefore, considering non-consumptive effects of predators in complex food webs will likely improve the understanding of biotic interactions across environmental gradients.",5,2013,82,3,598,607,10.1111/1365-2656.12042"Cabrero, P; Richmond, L; Nitabach, M; Davies, SA; Dow, JAT",A biogenic amine and a neuropeptide act identically: tyramine signals through calcium in Drosophila tubule stellate cells,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,Article,Malpighian tubule; insect physiology; ion transport; endocrinology; aequorin; calcium,"Insect osmoregulation is subject to highly sophisticated endocrine control. In Drosophila, both Drosophila kinin and tyramine act on the Malpighian (renal) tubule stellate cell to activate chloride shunt conductance, and so increase the fluid production rate. Drosophila kinin is known to act through intracellular calcium, but the mode of action of tyramine is not known. Here, we used a transgenically encoded GFP::apoaequorin translational fusion, targeted to either principal or stellate cells under GAL4/UAS control, to demonstrate that tyramine indeed acts to raise calcium in stellate, but not principal cells. Furthermore, the EC(50) tyramine concentration for half-maximal activation of the intracellular calcium signal is the same as that calculated from previously published data on tyramine-induced increase in chloride flux. In addition, tyramine signalling to calcium is markedly reduced in mutants of NorpA (a phospholipase C) and itpr, the inositol trisphosphate receptor gene, which we have previously shown to be necessary for Drosophila kinin signalling. Therefore, tyramine and Drosophila kinin signals converge on phospholipase C, and thence on intracellular calcium; and both act to increase chloride shunt conductance by signalling through itpr. To test this model, we co-applied tyramine and Drosophila kinin, and showed that the calcium signals were neither additive nor synergistic.

Using a meta-analytical approach, we assessed the biological responses of marine organisms to the effects of ocean acidification and warming in isolation and combination. As expected biological responses varied across taxonomic groups, life-history stages, and trophic levels, but importantly, combining stressors generally exhibited a stronger biological (either positive or negative) effect. Using a subset of orthogonal studies, we show that four of five of the biological responses measured (calcification, photosynthesis, reproduction, and survival, but not growth) interacted synergistically when warming and acidification were combined. The observed synergisms between interacting stressors suggest that care must be made in making inferences from single-stressor studies. Our findings clearly have implications for the development of adaptive management strategies particularly given that the frequency of stressors interacting in marine systems will be likely to intensify in the future. There is now an urgent need to move toward more robust, holistic, and ecologically realistic climate change experiments that incorporate interactions.

Here we seek to understand how abiotic and biotic stresses associated with climate change can affect plant-herbivore interactions in a model crop species (soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr.) by answering three questions: (1) Do the combined effects of abiotic and biotic stresses associated with climate change cause synergistic negative effects on plant biomass? (2) Can abiotic stress affect resistance of plants to insect herbivores? (3) Does genetic variation in plant traits modify a plant's response to stress? We performed three experiments in controlled growth environments using up to 51 soybean genotypes selected to vary in numerous traits associated with drought and resistance against pests (e.g., insect herbivores, nematodes, and pathogenic fungi), and up to 3 generalist-feeding herbivorous noctuid moth species (Helicoverpa zea, Heliothis virescens, and Spodoptera exigua) that commonly feed on soybean in North America. Drought and herbivory had the largest and the most consistent negative effects on plant performance, reducing the above- and below-ground biomass by 10-45 %, whereas increased temperature had little to no effect on plants. Drought also increased susceptibility to generalist noctuid herbivores, but these results varied dramatically in magnitude and direction among plant genotypes. Our experiments show that the effects of abiotic and biotic stress on soybean biomass were largely due to the additive effects of these stresses, and there exists substantial genetic variation in the soybean germplasm pool we studied that could be used as a source of parental stock in breeding new crops that can more effectively tolerate and resist the combined negative effects of insect herbivory and drought.",4,2013,7,2,201,215,10.1007/s11829-012-9234-z"Brodie, J; Johnson, H; Mitchell, M; Zager, P; Proffitt, K; Hebblewhite, M; Kauffman, M; Johnson, B; Bissonette, J; Bishop, C; Gude, J; Herbert, J; Hersey, K; Hurley, M; Lukacs, PM; McCorquodale, S; McIntire, E; Nowak, J; Sawyer, H; Smith, D; White, PJ","Relative influence of human harvest, carnivores, and weather on adult female elk survival across western North America",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,Article,additive mortality; Cervus elaphus; climate change; compensatory mortality; harvest; predation; ungulate,"Well-informed management of harvested species requires understanding how changing ecological conditions affect demography and population dynamics, information that is lacking for many species. We have limited understanding of the relative influence of carnivores, harvest, weather and forage availability on elk Cervus elaphus demography, despite the ecological and economic importance of this species. We assessed adult female survival, a key vital rate for population dynamics, from 2746 radio-collared elk in 45 populations across western North America that experience wide variation in carnivore assemblage, harvest, weather and habitat conditions. Proportional hazard analysis revealed that baseline' (i.e. not related to human factors) mortality was higher with very high winter precipitation, particularly in populations sympatric with wolves Canis lupus. Mortality may increase via nutritional stress and heightened vulnerability to predation in snowy winters. Baseline mortality was unrelated to puma Puma concolor presence, forest cover or summer forage productivity. Cause-specific mortality analyses showed that wolves and all carnivore species combined had additive effects on baseline elk mortality, but only reduced survival by <2%. When human factors were included, total' adult mortality was solely related to harvest; the influence of native carnivores was compensatory. Annual total mortality rates were lowest in populations sympatric with both pumas and wolves because managers reduced female harvest in areas with abundant or diverse carnivores. Mortality from native carnivores peaked in late winter and early spring, while harvest-induced mortality peaked in autumn. The strong peak in harvest-induced mortality during the autumn hunting season decreased as the number of native carnivore species increased. Synthesis and applications. Elevated baseline adult female elk mortality from wolves in years with high winter precipitation could affect elk abundance as winters across the western US become drier and wolves recolonize portions of the region. In the absence of human harvest, wolves had additive, although limited, effects on mortality. However, human harvest, and its apparent use by managers to offset predation, primarily controls overall variation in adult female mortality. Altering harvest quotas is thus a strong tool for offsetting impacts of carnivore recolonization and shifting weather patterns on elk across western North America.",11,2013,50,2,295,305,10.1111/1365-2664.12044"Pompini, M; Clark, ES; Wedekind, C",Pathogen-induced hatching and population-specific life-history response to waterborne cues in brown trout (Salmo trutta),BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,Article,Additive genetic variation; Fish embryo; Induced hatching; Niche shift; Phenotypic plasticity; Reaction norm; Salmonid,"Hatching is an important niche shift, and embryos in a wide range of taxa can either accelerate or delay this life-history switch in order to avoid stage-specific risks.

As a study species, we chose the brown trout (Salmo trutta; Salmonidae).

The resulting embryos were either directly infected with Pseudomonas fluorescens or were exposed to waterborne cues from P. fluorescens-infected conspecifics. We found that direct inoculation with P. fluorescens increased embryonic mortality and induced hatching in all host populations. Exposure to waterborne cues revealed population-specific responses. We found significant additive genetic variation for hatching time, and genetic variation in trait plasticity. In conclusion, hatching is induced in response to infection and can be affected by waterborne cues of infection, but populations and families differ in their reaction to the latter.",5,2013,67,4,649,656,10.1007/s00265-013-1484-y"Brandt, AJ; de Kroon, H; Reynolds, HL; Burns, JH",Soil heterogeneity generated by plant-soil feedbacks has implications for species recruitment and coexistence,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Article,environmental heterogeneity; net pairwise soil feedbacks; plant population and community dynamics; recruitment dynamics; soil history; spatial heterogeneity; vital rates,"1. Most studies of soil heterogeneity have focused on underlying abiotic factors such as soil nutrients. However, increasing recognition of plant-soil feedback (PSF) effects on plant growth, combined with the observation that PSFs operate at small spatial scales, suggests that heterogeneity due to PSF could affect plant population and community dynamics. The consequences of PSF-generated heterogeneity for coexistence depend on heterogeneity's effects on vital rates and how those vital rates influence population-level recruitment dynamics. 2. We measured vital rates and recruitment dynamics of three congeneric pairs of introduced perennial plants grown as monocultures in experimental PSF-generated soil environments. Field soils collected from conspecifics and congeners were alternated in patches or mixed together to produce heterogeneous and homogeneous soils, respectively. 3. We quantified the effects of PSF-generated heterogeneity on germination and establishment and determined how these vital rates affected recruitment. We calculated net pairwise interaction coefficients to predict whether PSFs could mediate coexistence between congeners. 4. Soil heterogeneity altered the relationship of vital rates to recruitment dynamics for some species. For example, Solanum dulcamara recruited later into heterogeneous than homogeneous soils, and germination was a stronger predictor of the timing of recruitment in heterogeneous soil, while mortality was a stronger predictor in homogeneous soil. Contrasts between soils of different origin suggest that mixing soils had non-additive effects on vital rates (e. g. Rumex crispus mortality was higher in homogeneous than in conspecific or congener soil). Interaction coefficients predicted that PSFs in heterogeneous soils might mediate stable coexistence only of Rumex congeners. 5. Synthesis. Heterogeneity generated by PSFs had species-specific effects on vital rates, with consequences for recruitment dynamics. Mixing soils of different origin often resulted in non-additive effects, which may indicate an interaction between soil abiotic and/or biotic properties and could predict non-additive responses to soil disturbance. Finally, quantifying the reciprocal effects of PSFs on congeners suggests that PSF-generated heterogeneity may promote coexistence of certain species, which was not evident from individual PSF responses.

Short-term predictions of expected group size and simulated group trajectories over the longer term agree well with observations. Group dynamics are characterized by slow increases during the breeding season and relatively sharp declines during the pre-breeding season, particularly after dry years. We examine the demographic mechanisms responsible for environmental dependence. While individuals appear more prone to emigrate after dry years, seasons of low rainfall also cause reductions in reproductive output that produce adult-biased age distributions in the following dispersal season. Adult subordinates are much more likely to disperse or be evicted than immature individuals, and demographic structure thus contributes to crashes in group size.

The proportion of satisfactory models (AUC > 0.7) was lowest for bacteria (11.1% of the models), followed by phyto- (24.2%) and zooplankton (38.1%). The occurrences of taxa within all planktonic groups were related to climatic variables to a certain degree, but bacteria showed the strongest associations with the climatic variables. Moreover, zooplankton occurrences were more related to biotic variables than the occurrences of smaller taxa, while phytoplankton occurrences were more related to water chemistry.

Water-retention additives have the potential to increase substrate water availability leading to greater plant growth and survival, expanding the range of plant species suitable for green roofs. We determined whether two different water-retention additives (silicate granules and hydrogel) increased substrate WHC, plant available water (PAW), days until permanent wilting and growth of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L) and white lupin (Lupinus albus L) grown in green roof substrates. Two substrates were compared; one based on scoria, the other based on crushed terracotta roof-tiles. Without additives both substrates had similar WHC (40-43%) but PAW was lower in scoria than in roof-tile due to greater air-filled porosity (AFP) and lower bulk density in scoria. Silicates increased WHC in both scoria and roof-tile substrates, but hydrogel only improved scoria WHC. The effects of additives on PAW differed between plant species, with additives increasing PAW in both substrates for wheat but only in roof-tile for lupins. PAW was not significantly different between hydrogel and silicates. Although hydrogels increased substrate WHC and PAW there was no increase in time until wilting in either substrate. Silicates on the other hand, increased time until wilting and total and root biomass for wheat growing in scoria and for lupins in both substrates.

A recent meta-analysis showed that empirically measured phage-bacteria infection networks are often significantly nested, on average, and not modular. A perfectly nested network is one in which phages can be ordered from specialist to generalist such that the host range of a given phage is a subset of the host range of the subsequent phage in the ordering. The same meta-analysis hypothesized that modularity, in which groups of phages specialize on distinct groups of hosts, should emerge at larger geographic and/or taxonomic scales. In this paper, we evaluate the largest known phage-bacteria interaction data set, representing the interaction of 215 phage types with 286 host types sampled from geographically separated sites in the Atlantic Ocean. We find that this interaction network is highly modular. In addition, some of the modules identified in this data set are nested or contain submodules, indicating the presence of multi-scale structure, as hypothesized in the earlier meta-analysis. We examine the role of geography in driving these patterns and find evidence that the host range of phages and the phage permissibility of bacteria is driven, in part, by geographic separation.

However, oxidative damage did not accumulate with age in either sex. Previously we have shown antagonistic pleiotropy between the genes for early-life reproductive effort and ageing rate in both sexes, although this was stronger in females.

Using historical patterns of ditch construction on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, we tested the hypothesis that mosquito ditches have exacerbated salt marsh die-offs. Ditching activities occurred in the 1930s and were followed by post-World War II shoreline development, which created >90% of current shoreline infrastructure on Cape Cod. Recently, predator depletion caused by recreational fishing has allowed populations of a native herbivorous crab (Sesarrna reticulatum) to increase dramatically, triggering herbivore-driven cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) die-off at developed sites. Depression-era mosquito ditching had little effect for decades, but accelerated subsequent die-offs by expanding cordgrass habitat. Despite occurring decades apart, ditching interacted synergistically with shoreline development and recreational fishing to devastate similar to 55% of low marsh habitat (the narrow band of marsh grass necessary for marsh persistence and expansion). This suggests that historical human impacts can remain dormant for decades before interacting unexpectedly with modern perturbations. Such latent impacts are widespread in both marine and terrestrial habitats and may be common in other ecosystems with a history of disturbance.

Identifying the role and interplay of different potential stressors becomes a key question. Anadromous fishes will be exposed to both river and oceanic habitat changes. For Atlantic salmon, the river water temperature, river flow and oceanic growth conditions appear as three main stressing factors. They could act on population dynamics or as selective forces on life-history pathways. Using an individual-based demo-genetic model, we assessed the effects of these factors (1) to compare risks of extinction resulting from CC in river and ocean, and (2) to assess CC effects on life-history pathways including the evolution of underlying genetic control of phenotypic plasticity. We focused on Atlantic salmon populations from Southern Europe for a time horizon of three decades. We showed that CC in river alone should not lead to extinction of Southern European salmon populations. In contrast, the reduced oceanic growth appeared as a significant threat for population persistence. An increase in river flow amplitude increased the risk of local extinction in synergy with the oceanic effects, but river temperature rise reduced this risk. In terms of life-history modifications, the reduced oceanic growth increased the age of return of individuals through plastic and genetic responses. The river temperature rise increased the proportion of sexually mature parr, but the genetic evolution of the maturation threshold lowered the maturation rate of male parr. This was identified as a case of environmentally driven plastic response that masked an underlying evolutionary response of plasticity going in the opposite direction.

It would be particularly useful to understand whether the synergistic effects of global and local stressors could be alleviated, leading to slower change or faster recovery, if conditions under the control of local management alone were managed (i.e. nutrient pollution). We utilized field-based mesocosms to manipulate CO2 (i.e. forecasted global concentrations) and nutrients (i.e. local pollution) to test the hypothesis that, where synergies exist, reducing one contributing stressor would limit the effect of the other. In testing this hypothesis, we considered the response of turfing algae, which can displace kelp forests on urbanized coastlines. Initial manipulations of CO2 and nutrient enrichment produced an anticipated synergistic effect on the biomass of turfing algae. Following exposure of algal turfs to a combination of enriched nutrients and CO2, a subsequent reduction in nutrients was able to substantially slow further increases in turf growth. Despite this substantial effect, the historical legacy of previous nutrient enrichment was evident as greater turf was maintained relative to ambient conditions (i.e. ambient CO2 and nutrients). Such legacies of past stressors may be stubborn (e.g. persist as intergenerational change) where the alternative state (i.e. turf algae) has substantial resilience to restorative actions. Synthesis and applications. As stressors accumulate across global to local scales, some combine to produce synergistic effects which cause changes of disproportionate ecological magnitude. While strong synergies attract heavy scrutiny, there remains substantial merit in assessing whether their influence can be ameliorated by managing a contributing stressor. Of note, we show that by reducing a locally determined stressor (nutrients), its synergistic effects with a globally determined stressor (CO2 enrichment) on a key taxon (turf algae) may be substantially reduced. These results suggest that in the face of changing climate (e.g. ocean acidification), the management of local stressors (e.g. water pollution) may have a greater contribution in determining the dominant state than current thinking allows.",14,2013,50,1,51,58,10.1111/1365-2664.12019"Roberts, DA; Birchenough, SNR; Lewis, C; Sanders, MB; Bolam, T; Sheahan, D",Ocean acidification increases the toxicity of contaminated sediments,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Letter,contaminated sediment; Corophium volutator; DNA damage; metals; ocean acidification; toxicity,"Ocean acidification (OA) may alter the behaviour of sediment-bound metals, modifying their bioavailability and thus toxicity. We provide the first experimental test of this hypothesis with the amphipod Corophium volutator. Amphipods were exposed to two test sediments, one with relatively high metals concentrations (Sigma(metals) 239 mg kg(-1)) and a reference sediment with lower contamination (Sigma(metals) 82 mg kg(-1)) under conditions that mimic current and projected conditions of OA (390-1140 mu atm pCO(2)). Survival and DNA damage was measured in the amphipods, whereas the flux of labile metals was measured in the sediment and water column (WC) using Diffusive Gradients in Thin-films. The contaminated sediments became more acutely toxic to C. volutator under elevated pCO(2) (1140 mu atm). There was also a 2.7-fold increase in DNA damage in amphipods exposed to the contaminated sediment at 750 mu atm pCO(2), as well as increased DNA damage in organisms exposed to the reference sediment, but only at 1140 mu atm pCO(2). The projected pCO(2) concentrations increased the flux of nickel and zinc to labile states in the WC and pore water. However, the increase in metal flux at elevated pCO(2) was equal between the reference and contaminated sediments or, occasionally, greater from reference sediments. Hence, the toxicological interaction between OA and contaminants could not be explained by effects of pH on metal speciation. We propose that the additive physiological effects of OA and contaminants will be more important than changes in metal speciation in determining the responses of benthos to contaminated sediments under OA. Our data demonstrate clear potential for near-future OA to increase the susceptibility of benthic ecosystems to contaminants. Environmental policy should consider contaminants within the context of changing environmental conditions. Specifically, sediment metals guidelines may need to be reevaluated to afford appropriate environmental protection under future conditions of OA.",22,2013,19,2,340,351,10.1111/gcb.12048"Ibanez, T; Borgniet, L; Mangeas, M; Gaucherel, C; Geraux, H; Hely, C",Rainforest and savanna landscape dynamics in New Caledonia: Towards a mosaic of stable rainforest and savanna states?,AUSTRAL ECOLOGY,Article,fire; generalized additive model; habitat suitability index; refuge; topographical landscapes feature,"Stable forested environments can be converted to savanna in response to changes in environmental disturbances. New Caledonia is a biodiversity hotspot; significant ecological and economic resources would be lost if forests were turned into savanna by anthropogenic environmental changes. On the landscape scale, systems that have undergone shifts of this kind are characterized by sharp forestsavanna boundaries and mosaic-like distributions of savanna and forest. Understanding the locations and the dynamics of such boundaries is a challenge for ecologists and is critical for landscape management and biodiversity conservation. Using a time series of aerial photographs (19552000) and a forest habitat suitability map, we tested the hypothesis that topography and spatial processes, especially those relating to fire spread and seed dispersal, are the main determinants of the spatial distribution of rainforest and savanna in a New Caledonian landscape covering 24 km2. Within the studied landscape, the overall forest coverage decreased by 24% between 1976 and 2000. This was primarily due to the contraction of forests on west-facing slopes, which accounted for about 90% of the total loss. Conversely, the east-facing forests seemed to have contracted extensively prior to the studied period, and were confined to refuges. A habitat suitability index calculated from the landscape's topographical features using generalized additive models accurately predicted both the presence of forests and the probability of forest expansion/contraction. We also provide evidence that spatial processes such as fire spread and seed dispersal limit the expansion and contraction of forests. Our results suggest that rainforests on west-facing slopes in New Caledonia will be progressively destroyed by fire until they are restricted to refuges along thalwegs and creeks, as appears to have already happened for their east-facing counterparts.",7,2013,38,1,33,45,10.1111/j.1442-9993.2012.02369.x"Silliman, BR; McCoy, MW; Angelini, C; Holt, RD; Griffin, JN; van de Koppel, J","Consumer Fronts, Global Change, and Runaway Collapse in Ecosystems","ANNUAL REVIEW OF ECOLOGY, EVOLUTION, AND SYSTEMATICS, VOL 44",Review; Book Chapter,top-down control; predation; ecosystem resilience; catastrophic collapse; spatial processes; thresholds; climate change; resource-dependent movement; density-dependent; aggregation; behavior; wave propagation,"Consumer fronts occur when grazers or predators aggregate in bands along the edges of a resource. Our review reveals that consumer fronts are a common phenomenon in nature, occur in many different ecosystems, and are triggered by universal mechanisms: External forces locally increase top-down control beyond prey carrying and/or renewal capacity, and resource-dependent movement leads to consumer aggregation along the edge of the remaining prey population. Once formed, consumer fronts move through systems as spatially propagating waves, self-reinforced via intense overexploitation and amplified by density-dependent feedbacks. When consumer fronts are spatially restricted, they generate patchiness. In contrast, when consumer fronts are expansive, they can lead to runaway responses that cause large-scale ecosystem degradation and regime shifts. We conceptualize a synergistic stress hypothesis and model that highlight how coupled intensification of physical stress and enhanced consumer pressure can trigger increased occurrence of consumer fronts and decreased system stability and resilience.

The potential interactive effects of these different stressors cannot be determined by studying each in isolation, although such synergies have been largely ignored in ecological field studies to date. Here, we use a model system of naturally fragmented islands in a braided river network, which is exposed to periodic inundation, to investigate the interactive effects of habitat isolation and flood disturbance. Food web structure was similar across the islands during periods of hydrological stability, but several key properties were altered in the aftermath of flood disturbance, based on distance of the islands from the regional source pool of species: taxon richness and mean food chain length declined with habitat isolation after flooding, while the proportion of basal species increased. Greater species turnover through time reflected the slower process of re-colonisation on the more distant islands following disturbance. Increased variability of several food web properties over a 1-year period highlighted the reduced temporal stability of isolated habitat fragments. Many of these effects reflected the differential successes of predator and prey species at re-colonising the islands: even though larger, more mobile consumers may reach the more distant islands first, they cannot establish populations until the lower trophic levels have successfully reassembled.

Annual cumulative fluxes of nitrous oxide and methane varied markedly among ecosystems, with nitrous oxide fluxes being highest for the tropical forest site (tropical forest: 0.96 kgN ha(-1) yr(-1); temperate forest: 0.67 kgN ha(-1) yr(-1); steppe: 0.22 kgN ha(-1) yr(-1)), while rates of soil methane uptake were approximately equal for the temperate forest (-3.45 kgC ha(-1) yr(-1)) and the steppe (-3.39 kgC ha(-1) yr(-1)), but lower for the tropical forest site (-2.38 kgC ha(-1) yr(-1)). In order to allow for cross-site comparison of effects of changes in soil moisture and soil temperature on fluxes of methane and nitrous oxide, we used a normalization approach. Data analysis with normalized data revealed that, across sites, optimum rates of methane uptake are found at environmental conditions representing approximately average site environmental conditions. This might have rather important implications for understanding effects of climate change on soil methane uptake potential, since any shift in environmental conditions is likely to result in a reduction of soil methane uptake ability. For nitrous oxide, our analysis revealed expected patterns: highest nitrous oxide emissions under moist and warm conditions and large nitrous oxide fluxes if soils are exposed to freeze-thawing effects at sufficiently high soil moisture contents. However, the explanatory power of relationships of soil moisture or soil temperature to nitrous oxide fluxes remained rather poor (R-2 <= 0.36). When combined effects of changes in soil moisture and soil temperature were considered, the explanatory power of our empirical relationships with regard to temporal variations in nitrous oxide fluxes were at maximum about 50 %. This indicates that other controlling factors such as N and C availability or microbial community dynamics might exert a significant control on the temporal dynamic of nitrous oxide fluxes. Though underlying microbial processes such as nitrification and denitrification are sensitive to changes in the environmental regulating factors, important regulating factors like moisture and temperature seem to have both synergistic and antagonistic effects on the status of other regulating factors. Thus we cannot expect a simple relationship between them and the pattern in the rate of emissions, associated with denitrification or nitrification in the soils. In conclusion, we hypothesize that our approach of data generalization may prove beneficial for the development of environmental response models, which can be used across sites, and which are needed to help achieve a better understanding of climate change feedbacks on biospheric sinks or sources of nitrous oxide and methane.",16,2013,10,5,3205,3219,10.5194/bg-10-3205-2013"Buchheister, A; Bonzek, CF; Gartland, J; Latour, RJ",Patterns and drivers of the demersal fish community of Chesapeake Bay,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,Article,Community structure; Demersal fishes; Chesapeake Bay; Environmental conditions; Species richness; Species diversity; Hypoxia; Bottom trawl survey,"Large-scale research on the environmental, biological, and anthropogenic drivers of fish distributions, abundances, and community structure can identify patterns and trends within systems, provide mechanistic insight into ecosystem functioning, and contribute to ecosystem-based fisheries management.

Five species (Atlantic croaker, white perch, spot, striped bass, and summer flounder) accounted for >75% of the total trawled biomass. The demersal fish community was primarily structured by the latitudinal salinity gradient that largely differentiated anadromous fishes from coastal shelf spawning species and elasmobranchs, with low overall CPUE and richness in mesohaline waters. Low dissolved oxygen concentrations (below similar to 4 mg l(-1)) greatly suppressed CPUE and diversity metrics and appeared to displace fish biomass toward the northern and southern edges of the bay's mainstem channel. Water temperature and month strongly influenced the seasonal dynamics of community composition and metrics.

The loss of farmland biodiversity threatens the sustainability of ecosystem services delivered within agricultural landscapes. The functional trait approach has been successfully used in grassland systems to quantify trade-offs and synergies between services delivered directly by plant communities. Many of the services delivered by arable landscapes, however, depend on invertebrate consumers, and the application of the trait-based approach to these systems depends on quantifying functional relationships between trophic levels. 2. Two data sets of plant and invertebrate communities from a range of annual crops and uncropped land habitats were analysed. The community-weighted means of plant functional traits were calculated for the vegetation samples and used as the explanatory variables in a multivariate analysis of plant species composition across habitats. The constrained axes scores were used in statistical models to explain the variance in associated total invertebrate abundance, phytophagous invertebrates and invertebrate numbers weighted by importance in the diet of farmland bird chicks. 3. The multivariate analysis discriminated between plant communities characterized by ruderal traits (high specific leaf area and early flowering) and those with more competitive traits. More ruderal communities also supported proportionally more invertebrates. The suite of traits included in the analysis explained a greater proportion of the variance in invertebrate abundance between uncropped habitats, as opposed to between annual crops. 4. The overlap between the plant traits that respond to disturbance (functional response traits) and those that affect the abundance of phytophagous invertebrates (functional effect traits) and the diet of farmland birds demonstrates the potential for using common functional metrics to integrate the assessment of an ecosystem service across different habitats particularly on uncropped land where intensity of disturbance is the main environmental driver. 5. Synthesis. The quantification of functional linkages between arable plants and the abundance of their associated invertebrate consumer communities is the first step in extending the trait-based approach to quantify trade-offs and synergies between ecosystem services developed in grassland systems to landscapes dominated by arable crops.

Biotic resistance, the ability of species in a community to limit invasion, is central to our understanding of how communities at risk of invasion assemble after disturbances, but it has yet to translate into guiding principles for the restoration of invasion-resistant plant communities. We combined experimental, functional, and modelling approaches to investigate processes of community assembly contributing to biotic resistance to an introduced lineage of Phragmites australis, a model invasive species in North America. We hypothesized that (i) functional group identity would be a good predictor of biotic resistance to P. australis, while species identity effect would be redundant within functional group (ii) mixtures of species would be more invasion resistant than monocultures. 2. We classified 36 resident wetland plants into four functional groups based on eight functional traits. We conducted two competition experiments based on the additive competition design with P. australis and monocultures or mixtures of wetland plants. As an indicator of biotic resistance, we calculated a relative competition index (RCIavg) based on the average performance of P. australis in competition treatment compared with control. To explain diversity effect further, we partitioned it into selection effect and complementarity effect and tested several diversity-interaction models. 3. In monoculture treatments, RCIavg of wetland plants was significantly different among functional groups, but not within each functional group. We found the highest RCIavg for fast-growing annuals, suggesting priority effect. 4. RCIavg of wetland plants was significantly greater in mixture than in monoculture mainly due to complementarity-diversity effect among functional groups. In diversity-interaction models, species interaction patterns in mixtures were described best by interactions between functional groups when fitted to RCIavg or biomass, implying niche partitioning. 5. Synthesis. Functional group identity and diversity of resident plant communities are good indicators of biotic resistance to invasion by introduced Phragmites australis, suggesting niche pre-emption (priority effect) and niche partitioning (diversity effect) as underlying mechanisms. Guiding principles to understand and/or manage biological invasion could emerge from advances in community theory and the use of a functional framework.

We investigated the effects of warming and acidification on development to the non-calcifying larval stage in the sea star Patiriella regularis, in embryos reared from fertilization in present and future (2100+) conditions. Fertilization using gametes from multiple parents, to represent populations of spawners, was resilient to both stressors, as were cleavage stage embryos. Warming increased developmental rate across all pH levels. For blastulae, there was a complex interaction between stressors, with +4 degrees C/pH 7.6 lethal to many embryos. A 4 degrees C warming increased mortality by the gastrulation stage by 13 to 25% across all pH levels. In conjunction with warming, pH 7.6 increased mortality by 25 to 27% across all temperatures. For embryos that reached the 3 d bipinnaria stage, warming reduced the percentage of normal larvae and larval size, with no effect of acidification. These results highlight the importance of considering both warming and acidification, and effects on early embryos, in assessing life history responses to ocean change. Bipinnaria reared to Day 28 to determine the effects of acidification on non-calcifying feeding larvae provided a comparison with results for calcifying echinoplutei. pH 7.6 resulted in smaller larvae and increased mortality by 30%.

Within these regions, the Hudson Bay Lowlands are home to an overabundant breeding population of lesser snow geese that has dramatically damaged the ecosystem, with cascading effects at multiple trophic levels. In some areas the overabundance of geese has led to a drastic reduction in available forage. In addition, warming of this region has widened the gap between goose migration timing and plant green-up, and this mismatch between goose and plant phenologies could in turn affect gosling development. The dual effects of climate change and habitat quality on gosling body condition and juvenile survival are not known, but are critical for predicting population growth and related degradation of (sub) arctic ecosystems. To address these issues, we used information on female goslings marked and measured between 1978 and 2005 (4125 individuals). Goslings that developed within and near the traditional center of the breeding colony experienced the effects of long-term habitat degradation: body condition and juvenile survival declined over time. In newly colonized areas, however, we observed the opposite pattern (increase in body condition and juvenile survival). In addition, warmer than average winters and summers resulted in lower gosling body condition and first-year survival. Too few plant growing days in the spring relative to hatch led to similar results. Our assessment indicates that geese are recovering from habitat degradation by moving to newly colonized locales.

Using a process-based forest model (LandClim) we simulated forest dynamics and FGS under a range of climate change and management scenarios in the Black Forest, Germany, which is shaped by various management practices. We focused on the interdependencies between timber production and forest diversity, the most valued FGS in this region. We found that the conversion to more drought-adapted forest types is required to prevent climate change-induced forest dieback and that this conversion must be the target of any adaptive management, especially in areas where monocultures of drought-sensitive Norway spruce (Picea abies) were promoted in the past. Forest conversion takes up to 120 years, however, with past and future adaptive management being the key drivers of timber and forest diversity provision. The conversion of drought-sensitive conifer monocultures maintains timber production in the short term and enhances a range of forest diversity indices. Using uneven-aged forest management that targets a drought-adapted, diverse, and resilient species mixture, high species diversity can be combined with timber production in the long term. Yet, the promotion of mature-stand attributes requires management restrictions. Selecting future adaptive management options thus implies the consideration of trade-offs between forest resource use and environmental objectives, but also the exploitation of synergies between FGS that occur during forest conversion.

Accordingly, we studied resident wolves and coyotes in and adjacent to APP to identify distinct Canis types, clarify the extent of the APP eastern wolf population beyond the park boundaries and investigate fine-scale spatial genetic structure and landscapegenotype associations in the hybrid zone. We documented three genetically distinct Canis types within the APP region that also differed morphologically, corresponding to putative gray wolves, eastern wolves and coyotes.

Besides reducing neutral genetic variability, founder effects can in principle shift additive genetic variance for phenotypes that underlie fitness. This could then lead to different rates of adaptation among populations that have undergone a population size bottleneck as well as an environmental change, even when these populations have a common evolutionary history. Thus, theory suggests that there should be an association between observable genetic variability for both neutral markers and phenotypes related to fitness. Here, we test this scenario by monitoring the early evolutionary dynamics of six laboratory foundations derived from founders taken from the same source natural population of Drosophila subobscura. Each foundation was in turn three-fold replicated. During their first few generations, these six foundations showed an abrupt increase in their genetic differentiation, within and between foundations. The eighteen populations that were monitored also differed in their patterns of phenotypic adaptation according to their immediately ancestral founding sample. Differences in early genetic variability and in effective population size were found to predict differences in the rate of adaptation during the first 21 generations of laboratory evolution. We show that evolution in a novel environment is strongly contingent not only on the initial composition of a newly founded population but also on the stochastic changes that occur during the first generations of colonization.

To address the question of whether the effects of simultaneous symbionts are contingent on the specific identities, we conducted a greenhouse experiment manipulating the presence and identities of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and fungal endophytes on the shared host grass Elymus hystrix. Each plant host was inoculated with one of two AMF species having varying effects on host growth, or a sterile soil control. Further, we used naturally occurring endophyte-infected (E+) and uninfected (E) individuals from two populations of the endophyte Epichloe elymi that varied in their interaction with E. hystrix. We then measured responses of plants, AMF, and fungal endophytes. Overall, we found that the combined effects of AMF and fungal endophytes on plant growth were additive, reflecting the mutualistic quality of each symbiont independently interacting with host plants. However, fungal endophyte infection differentially altered hyphal colonization of the two AMF species and the identity of the coinfecting AMF species affected fungal endophyte fitness traits.

Our results demonstrate the importance of AMF and N-2-fixers as drivers of plant community structure and function. In the communities, we found a positive effect of AMF on diversity and productivity, but a negative effect of N-2-fixers on productivity. Both AMF and N-2-fixers affected relative abundances of species. AMF shifted the communities from dominance by Elymus canadensis to Sorghastrum nutans, and seven other species increased in abundance with AMF, accounting for the increased diversity. N-2-fixers led to increases in Astragalus canadensis and Desmanthus illinoense, two legumes that likely benefited from the presence of the appropriate rhizobia symbionts. Sorghastrum nutans declined 44 % in the presence of N-2-fixers, with the most likely explanation being increased competition from legumes. Panicum monocultures were more productive with AMF, but showed no response to N-2-fixers, although inference was constrained by low Azospirillum treatment effectivity.

Coral recovery occurred on all substrate types, but it was highly variable among sites and times. Between 2005 and 2011 the increase in coral cover averaged 1%/year across 21 sites, and the maximum increase was 4%/year. However, mean coral cover across the study area (14%) remained at half of 1994 levels (28%). Sites within MPAs had faster rates of coral recovery than sites in fished areas only where cover of macroalgae was low and had not increased over time.

Although logical for the time, the scientific activities and resulting policies that arose out of this catastrophe were based on reductionist experimentation and productionist emphases on food and fiber. After a century of science and policy, there are two additional perspectives that shape our vision for the emphases of the future. First, rangeland landscapes are extremely heterogeneous; general principles derived from scientific experimentation cannot be easily or generally applied without adjusting to the distinct societal and ecological characteristics of a location. Second, rangeland management occurs at spatial scales considerably larger than those that have typically been addressed in range science. Scaling up science results is not a simple, additive process. The leading features of the emerging science are 1) research at landscape scales and 2) over longer time spans that 3) approaches conservation and management practices as treatments requiring scientific evaluation, 4) incorporates local knowledge, 5) is explicitly applied in nature, and 6) is transparent in its practice.

Location A 104,000 km2 area in the semi-arid Murray Mallee region of south-eastern Australia. Methods We surveyed reptiles at 280 sites across a century-long post-fire chronosequence. We developed generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) of the relationship between time since fire and the occurrence of 17 species in two subregions, and compared modelled responses with predictions derived from the conceptual model. The predictive capacity of GAMMs was then assessed (1) within the subregion the model was developed and (2) when transferred into a novel subregion. Results Eleven species displayed a significant relationship with time-since-fire, with changes in species probability of occurrence continuing up to 100 years post-fire. Predictions of the timing of species post-fire peak in occurrence were accurate for 9 of 13 species models for which a significant fire response was detected, but little success was achieved in predicting the shape of a species' response. GAMMs predicted species occurrence more accurately when applied within the subregion in which they were developed than when transferred into a novel subregion, primarily due to some species responding to fire more strongly in one part of their geographic range. Main conclusions Fire influences the occurrence of reptiles in semi-arid ecosystems over century-long time frames.

However, we know little about the overall trends of such responses, the GC drivers involved and the plant attributes affected. We synthesized literature to answer the question: Does soil heterogeneity significantly affect plant responses to main GC drivers, such as elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (CO2), nitrogen (N) enrichment and changes in rainfall regime? Overall, most studies have addressed short-term effects of N enrichment on the performance of model plant communities using experiments conducted under controlled conditions. The role of soil heterogeneity as a modulator of plant responses to elevated CO2 may depend on the plasticity in nutrient uptake patterns. Soil heterogeneity does interact with N enrichment to determine plant growth and nutrient status, but the outcome of this interaction has been found to be both synergistic and inhibitory. The very few studies published on interactive effects of soil heterogeneity and changes in rainfall regime prevented us from identifying any general pattern. We identify the long-term consequences of soil heterogeneity on plant community dynamics in the field, and the ecosystem-level responses of the soil heterogeneity x GC driver interaction, as the main knowledge gaps in this area of research. To fill these gaps and take soil heterogeneity and GC research a step forward, we propose the following research guidelines: (i) combining morphological and physiological plant responses to soil heterogeneity with field observations of community composition and predictions from simulation models and (ii) incorporating soil heterogeneity into a trait-based response-effect framework, where plant-resource-use traits are used as both response variables to this heterogeneity and GC, and predictors of ecosystem functioning.

Just as for competition, distinguishing different modes of facilitation (mutualistic, commensal or even antagonistic) may be crucial. We therefore introduce the new concept of symmetric versus asymmetric facilitation and present a generic individual-based zone-of-influence model. The model simultaneously implements different modes of both facilitation and competition among individual plants via their overlapping zone of influence. Because we consider facilitation modes as a continuum related to environmental context, we integrated this concept with the stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH) by exploring differences in spatial pattern formation in self-thinning plants along a stress gradient in our model. The interplay among modes of interaction creates distinctly varied spatial patterns along stress gradients. When competition was symmetric, symmetric facilitation (mutualism) consistently led to plant aggregation along stress gradients. However, asymmetric facilitation (commensalism) produces plant aggregation only under more benign conditions but tends to intensify local competition and spatial segregation when conditions are harsh. When competition was completely asymmetric, different modes of facilitation contributed little to spatial aggregation. Symmetric facilitation significantly increased survival at the severe end of the stress gradient, which supports the claim of the SGH that facilitation should have generally positive net effects on plants under high stress levels. Asymmetric facilitation, however, was found to increase survival only under intermediate stress conditions, which contradicts the current predictions of the SGH. Synthesis. Our modelling study demonstrates that the interplay between modes of facilitation and competition affects different aspects of plant populations and communities, implying context-dependent outcomes and consequences. The explicit consideration of the modes and mechanisms of interactions (both facilitation and competition) and the nature of stress factors will help to extend the framework of the SGH and foster research on facilitation in plant ecology.",10,2012,100,6,1482,1491,10.1111/j.1365-2745.2012.02019.x"Meunier, J; Kolliker, M",Parental antagonism and parent-offspring co-adaptation interact to shape family life,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,Article,facultative parental care; parental investment; food provisioning; conflicts; insect; Forficula auricularia,"The family is an arena for conflicts between offspring, mothers and fathers that need resolving to promote the evolution of parental care and the maintenance of family life. Co-adaptation is known to contribute to the resolution of parent-offspring conflict over parental care by selecting for combinations of offspring demand and parental supply that match to maximize the fitness of family members. However, multiple paternity and differences in the level of care provided by mothers and fathers can generate antagonistic selection on offspring demand (mediated, for example, by genomic imprinting) and possibly hamper co-adaptation. While parent-offspring co-adaptation and parental antagonism are commonly considered two major processes in the evolution of family life, their co-occurrence and the evolutionary consequences of their joint action are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate the simultaneous and entangled effects of these two processes on outcomes of family interactions, using a series of breeding experiments in the European earwig, Forficula auricularia, an insect species with uniparental female care. As predicted from parental antagonism, we show that paternally inherited effects expressed in offspring influence both maternal care and maternal investment in future reproduction. However, and as expected from the entangled effects of parental antagonism and co-adaptation, these effects critically depended on postnatal interactions with caring females and maternally inherited effects expressed in offspring.

Ocean acidification (OA) reduces the growth of recruiting benthic invertebrates, yet no direct effects on survivorship have been demonstrated. We tested whether the reduced growth of coral recruits caused by OA would increase their mortality by prolonging their vulnerability to an acute disturbance: fish herbivory on surrounding algal turf. After two months' growth in ambient or elevated CO2 levels, the linear extension and calcification of coral (Acropora millepora) recruits decreased as CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) increased. When recruits were subjected to incidental fish grazing, their mortality was inversely size dependent. However, we also found an additive effect of pCO(2) such that recruit mortality was higher under elevated pCO(2) irrespective of size. Compared to ambient conditions, coral recruits needed to double their size at the highest pCO(2) to escape incidental grazing mortality. This general trend was observed with three groups of predators (blenny, surgeonfish, and parrotfish), although the magnitude of the fish treatment varied among species.

In this study, we propose that female meiotic drive may contribute to the evolution of neo-sex chromosomes. The results of this study showed that in mammals, the XY1Y2 sex chromosome system is more prevalent in species with karyotypes of more biarmed chromosomes, whereas the X1X2Y sex chromosome system is more prevalent in species with predominantly acrocentric chromosomes. In species where biarmed chromosomes are favored by female meiotic drive, X-autosome fusions (XY1Y2 sex chromosome system) will be also favored by female meiotic drive. In contrast, in species with more acrocentric chromosomes, Y-autosome fusions (X1X2Y sex chromosome system) will be favored just because of the biased mutation rate toward chromosomal fusions.

Location (1) Field data from grazed semi-natural grasslands, NE Germany; (2) artificial data. Methods Research questions associated with traitenvironment relationships were briefly reviewed and seven available methods evaluated. The main distinction between research questions is whether traitenvironment relationships should be addressed at community or species level. A redundancy analysis (RDA) of mean trait values of species in a plot weighted by their abundances (CWM-RDA) is exclusively suitable for the community level. The other six methods address the species level. A double inertia analysis of two arrays (RLQ) and double canonical correspondence analysis (double CCA) use combinations of ordinations to simultaneously analyse species and trait responses to the environment. A combination of the outlying mean index with generalized additive models (OMI-GAM) predicts the response of species to environmental variables on trait gradients. RDA-RegTree first analyses species responses to the environment with RDA and then uses a regression tree to classify trait expressions according to scores of species responses on the ordination axes. Cluster regression uses cluster analyses and logistic regression to search for trait combinations with the best response to the environmental variables. This method models the distribution of functional groups on environmental gradients. All methods and data are available as R scripts. Results All methods consistently revealed the main trait responses to environment in the field data set, namely that life history was associated with available phosphorus while grazing intensity was related to leaf C:N ratio and canopy height. At community level, CWM-RDA gave a good overview of traitenvironment relationships, as also provided by the species-based methods RLQ and double CCA. OMI-GAM revealed non-linear relationships in the field data set. Field and artificial data gave that the number and stability of functional groups produced by Cluster regression and RDA-RegTree varied more strongly than RLQ, double CCA and OMI-GAM. Conclusions Each method addresses particular ecological concepts and research questions. If a user asks for the response of average trait expressions of communities to environmental gradients, CWM-RDA may be the first choice.

The injured sponges showed wide necrotic areas on the surface or disruption of the body in several portions. Necrotic areas were whitish and often were covered with a thin mucous coat formed by bacteria. In the most affected specimens, sponge organisation resulted partial or complete loss, with the final exposure of the dense skeletal network of spongine fibres to the environment. The results of microbiological cultural analysis using in parallel Marine Agar 2216 and thiosulphate/citrate/bile salts/sucrose agar demonstrated that, in affected specimens, vibrios represented 15.8 % of the total I. variabilis surface culturable bacteria. Moreover, all the isolated vibrios, grown from the wide whitish areas that characterize the surface of the diseased sponges, were identified, and their assignment to the Vibrio rotiferianus was consistent with phylogenetic analysis and data of morphological, cultural and biochemical tests. Studies on V. rotiferianus have shown that its pathogenicity, with respect to various aquatic organisms, is higher than that of Vibrio harveyi. The factors triggering the disease outbreak in Ircinia variabilis populations remain unclear. At present, we can hypothesize the involvement in the disease of a synergetic mechanism that, under stressful physiological conditions (high temperature, elevated nutrients and reduced water flow), induces sponge pathogens, in our case V. rotiferanius, to become virulent, making sponges unable to control their proliferation. Additional studies are needed to understand the etiological processes as well as the factors involved in sponges recovering from this epidemic event allowing them to face mass mortality.

Low tide stress could also play a role in this decline. We performed one mensurative (in situ) and two manipulative (in culture) experiments designed to evaluate the interactive effects of some physical factors. The first experiment analysed field response to low tide stress in marginal (mid-Cantabrian Sea and northern Portugal) versus central (Galicia) populations of F. serratus. Then a second experiment was performed that utilized either harsh or mild summer conditions of atmospheric temperature, irradiance, humidity, and wind velocity to compare the responses of individuals from one marginal and one central population to low tide stress. Finally, the combined effect of sea temperature and the other factors was evaluated to detect interactive effects. Changes in frond growth, maximal photosynthetic quantum yield (F (v)/F (m)), temperature, and desiccation were found. Three additive factors (solar irradiation, ocean and air temperatures) were found to drive F. serratus distribution, except under mildly humid conditions that ameliorated atmospheric thermal stress (two additive factors). Mid-Cantabrian Sea temperatures have recently increased, reaching the inhibitory levels suggested in this study of F. serratus. We also expect an additive secondary contribution of low tide stress to this species decline. On the northern Portugal coast, ocean warming plus low tide stress has not reached this species' inhibition threshold.

In this study we estimated the additive and non-additive components of the genetic variability of net reproductive rate (R-0) in a natural Daphnia magna population exposed to Cd stress at two different temperatures. To this end, life-table experiments were conducted with 20 parental and 39 offspring clonal lineages following a 2 x 2 design with Cd concentration (control vs. 3.7 mu g Cd/L) and temperature (20 vs. 24 A degrees C) as factors. Offspring lineages were obtained through inter-clonal crossing of the different parental lineages. The population mean, additive and non-additive genetic components of variation in each treatment were estimated by fitting an Animal Model to the observed R-0 values using restricted maximum likelihood estimation. From those estimates broad-sense heritabilities (H-2), narrow-sense heritabilities (h(2)), total (CVG) and additive genetic coefficients of variation (CVA) of R-0 were calculated. The exposure to Cd imposed a considerable level of stress to the population, as shown by the fact that the population mean of R-0 exposed to Cd was significantly lower than in the control at the corresponding temperature, i.e. by 23 % at 20 A degrees C and by 88 % at 24 A degrees C. The latter difference indicates that increasing temperature increased the stress level imposed by Cd. The HA(2) and CVG were significantly greater than 0 in all treatments, suggesting that there is a considerable degree of genetic determination of R-0 in this population and that clonal selection could rapidly lead to increasing population mean fitness under all investigated conditions. More specifically, the HA(2) was 0.392 at 20 A degrees C+Cd and 0.563 at 24 A degrees C+Cd; the CVG was 30.0 % at 20 A degrees C+Cd and was significantly higher (147.6 %) in the 24 A degrees C+Cd treatment. Significant values of h(2) (= 0.23) and CVA (= 89.7 %) were only found in the 24 A degrees C+Cd treatment, suggesting that the ability to produce more offspring under this stressful condition may be inherited across sexual generations. In contrast, in the less stressful 20 A degrees C+Cd treatment the h(2) (0.06) and CVA (7.0 %) were very low and not significantly higher than zero. Collectively our data indicate that both the asexual and sexual reproduction phases in cyclic parthenogenetic D. magna populations may play a role in the long-term adaptive potential of Daphnia populations to chemical stress (with Cd as the current example) and that environmental variables which influence the stress level of that chemical may influence this adaptive potential (with temperature as current example).",6,2012,21,7,1899,1910,10.1007/s10646-012-0923-2"Weydmann, A; Soreide, JE; Kwasniewski, S; Widdicombe, S",Influence of CO2-induced acidification on the reproduction of a key Arctic copepod Calanus glacialis,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,Article,Calanus; Decreased pH; Nauplii; Ocean acidification,"The Arctic Ocean is facing rapid changes in seawater carbonate chemistry due to the uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). In the current study, the effects of different seawater pH levels (8.2, 7.6 and 6.9) on the reproduction of Calanus glacialis, an Arctic shelf-water copepod, have been quantified. Results indicated that CO2-induced seawater acidification had no significant effect on C glacialis egg production. However, a reduction in pH to 6.9 significantly delayed hatching and possibly reduced overall hatching success. The results of the current study are in agreement with previous studies on other copepod species and would indicate that copepods, as a group, may be well equipped to deal with the chemical changes associated with ocean acidification. However, all previous studies have been over relatively short exposure periods and most have only considered the isolated impacts of elevated CO2. Long-term exposures examining the synergistic effects of ocean acidification with other climate stressors, particularly warming on population viability and success, have yet to be conducted.

In this paper, we mapped and quantified land use changes in the semi-arid Mediterranean agro-ecosystem of Torrealvilla catchment between 1956 and 2008. Subsequently, we detected signs of landscape fragmentation and examined the relationship between land use change trajectories and a set of biophysical factors using Generalized Additive Models (GAms). Finally, we qualitatively evaluated the role of socioeconomic drivers on the land use change trajectories. The study provides accounts of multidirectional land use trajectories in semi-arid Mediterranean landscapes. Our analysis shows that more than 72% of the study area has undergone significant changes over the past five decades with pronounced effects on landscape composition and structure. Both biophysical and socioeconomic factors are strongly related to the observed spatial and temporal changes in land use. Three major trajectories were observed. Firstly, rain-fed agriculture is becoming less dominant; future abandonment of rain-fed agriculture should be anticipated. Secondly, expansion of forested areas is evident in higher altitudes. The trend is still likely to continue given the possibility of further abandonment of rain-fed farming and existing subsidies for reforestation of arable land. Thirdly, intensification has been observed which has occurred mainly in lower parts of the landscape on flat to gentle slopes and near main roads. Further intensification is likely to be subject to market drivers, irrigation water availability, and future rural development and agricultural policy. Overall, the study shows that even within a given locality, contrasting land use trajectories can emerge as a result of local responses to multiple drivers of change and these need to be carefully taken into account in future policy development.

Both local rainfall and overbank flow contribute to water accessible by a plant. Variability in rainfall and hydrological regimes at seasonal and longer time scales exerts strong influences shaping ecosystem structure and function in arid and semi-arid floodplains. Yet there are few studies exploring how the interplay of climatic and hydrologic factors affects the integrity of floodplain ecosystems, especially the intermittently flooded vegetated wetlands. In fact, the importance of hydrological regimes prevailingly dominates the literature on floodplain ecology. Consequently, re-establishing and maintaining hydrological regimes has become the cornerstone underpinning most large scale floodplain conservation and restoration programs. In this study, we quantified the relative contribution of climatic and hydrologic variables to ecosystem functioning in the generalized additive modelling (GAM) framework using indicators derived from time series of MODIS 250 m NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). Results from the ""best fitted"" GAM models reveal that local rainfall has a closer and more important relationship with wetland mean NDVI (a surrogate of system primary productivity) although the co-variability between primary productivity and inflow is significantly positive. On the other hand, inflows play a dominant role in creating and maintaining the spatial heterogeneity represented by standard deviation of wetland NDVI while local rainfall has an opposite effect. Further, different vegetation community types exhibit distinct seasonality patterns in the NDVI-based primary productivity. These results illustrate the complexity of interactions between vegetation type, climate variations, and hydrology in floodplain wetlands. These results also demonstrate the sensitivity of floodplain wetlands to the perturbations in rainfall and temperature regimes, which would be more intense under the projected climate change.

We investigated how stress responses alter the contribution of additive genetic variation to gene expression during development of the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, under increased temperatures that model realistic climate change scenarios. We first measured gene expression responses in the embryos by RNA-seq to characterize molecular signatures of mild, chronic temperature stress in an unbiased manner. We found that an increase from 12 to 18 degrees C caused widespread alterations in gene expression including in genes involved in protein folding, RNA processing and development. To understand the quantitative genetic architecture of this response, we then focused on a well-characterized gene network involved in endomesoderm and ectoderm specification. Using a breeding design with wild-caught individuals, we measured genetic and geneenvironment interaction effects on 72 genes within this network. We found genetic or maternal effects in 33 of these genes and that the genetic effects were correlated in the network. Fourteen network genes also responded to higher temperatures, but we found no significant genotypeenvironment interactions in any of the genes. This absence may be owing to an effective buffering of the temperature perturbations within the network. In support of this hypothesis, perturbations to regulatory genes did not affect the expression of the genes that they regulate.

While global environmental change is transforming the ecology of tropical forests, a number of studies have also demonstrated that tropical forests are able to recover following disturbance. But are tropical forests resilient to environmental and anthropogenic disturbances over timescales of centuries or millennia? Here we examine the relationship between vegetation cover and variation in monsoon rainfall, soil erosion, and fire over 7500 years in an ancient tropical landscape in the Western Ghats of India. We collected two overlapping sediment sequences at one study site and analysed them with palaeoecological techniques to reconstruct vegetation cover. Results suggest that climate and land-use changes might have had synergistic effects on this forested landscape, although the relationship between these factors and vegetation cover has varied over time. Results also indicate that the weakening of monsoon around 5750 BP might have caused a threshold event altering this landscape to a low tree-cover state. Although anthropogenic fire has maintained this landscape in low tree cover state from 3500 BP, this degraded tree-grassland mosaic has remained relatively resilient to fluctuations in environmental and anthropogenic factors. Tree taxa present throughout the sequence have lighter seeds than those absent in parts of the sequence, suggesting that dispersal mode might be an important factor in their persistence. Despite maintaining a degraded and fragmented forest mosaic, however, this landscape has supported populations of heavy-seeded trees and a probable refuge to their dispersal agents. We suggest that retaining tree cover on this landscape, even if fragmented, is key to maintaining its ecological resilience to environmental and anthropogenic disturbance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Most wild animal populations are subjected to many perturbations, including environmental forcing and anthropogenic mortality. How population size varies in response to these perturbations largely depends on life-history strategy and density regulation. 2. Using the mid-continent population of redhead Aythya americana (a North American diving duck), we investigated the population response to two major perturbations, changes in breeding habitat availability (number of ponds in the study landscape) and changes in harvest regulations directed at managing mortality patterns (bag limit). We used three types of data collected at the continental scale (capturerecovery, population surveys and age- and sex ratios in the harvest) and combined them into integrated population models to assess the interaction between density dependence and the effect of perturbations. 3. We observed a two-way interaction between the effects on fecundity of pond number and population density. Hatch-year female survival was also density dependent. Matrix modelling showed that population booms could occur after especially wet years. However, the effect of moderate variation in pond number was generally offset by density dependence the following year. 4. Mortality patterns were insensitive to changes in harvest regulations and, in males at least, insensitive to density dependence as well.

Modern land-use practices often result in small and isolated populations, increasing the risk of extinction through reduced genetic diversity as a consequence of inbreeding or drift. Such genetic erosion may also interfere with a population's evolutionary potential. In this study, we investigate the consequences of inbreeding on evolutionary potential (the ability to increase cold resistance) in a laboratory population of the tropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana. To explore constraints on evolution, we applied artificial selection to chill-coma recovery time, starting from three levels of inbreeding (outbred control, one or two full-sibling matings). Ten generations of selection produced highly divergent phenotypes, with the lines selected for increased cold tolerance showing about 28% shorter recovery times after cold exposure relative to unselected controls. Correlated responses to selection in 10 different life-history and stress-resistance traits were essentially absent. Inbred lines showed a weaker response to selection, indicating reduced evolutionary potential and thereby constraints on evolution. Inbreeding depression was still measurable in some traits after the course of selection. Traits more closely related to fitness showed a clear fitness rebound, suggesting a trait-specific impact of purging.

Degradation of freshwater ecosystems is a major concern worldwide. Agriculture introduces multiple stressors to streams, presenting a challenge for freshwater managers who must understand the relative strengths of individual stressor effects and their combined multiple-stressor effects. 2. Using a replicated regression design, we manipulated levels of fine sediment and nutrients to create a broad eight-point gradient for each stressor across 128 stream mesocosms to determine the shapes of macroinvertebrate responses after 21 days of exposure. 3. Subsidystress response patterns occurred along both stressor gradients. Sediment addition provided an initial subsidy for some pollution-tolerant taxa and total macroinvertebrate density, but produced consistently negative effects for other taxa, total taxon richness and the density and richness of pollution-sensitive Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera (EPT) taxa. Nutrient enrichment provided an initial subsidy for densities of two common EPT taxa, total EPT density, macroinvertebrate and EPT taxon richness. 4. Few macroinvertebrate variables were affected by a single stressor (always fine sediment). The majority of responses were additive multiple-stressor patterns, although Chironomidae density and EPT taxon richness followed complex synergistic patterns. 5. Fine sediment was a much more pervasive stressor than augmented nutrient concentrations. Overall, macroinvertebrate traits responded to stressors as strongly as community variables or individual taxa. 6. Synthesis and applications. Managing both fine sediment and nutrient inputs from agriculture is crucial to achieve good stream condition but priority should be given to minimizing fine sediment, which should be maintained below a threshold of 5% cover and 0.5-mm depth. Managers also need to be wary of interactive multiple-stressor effects because ecological outcomes of an increase in stressor load may be worse than predicted based on the knowledge of single-stressor effects.",23,2012,49,4,892,902,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02162.x"Wikner, J; Andersson, A",Increased freshwater discharge shifts the trophic balance in the coastal zone of the northern Baltic Sea,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Article,bacterioplankton; climate; DOC; food web; growth; marine; nutrient; phytoplankton; precipitation,"Increased precipitation is one projected outcome of climate change that may enhance the discharge of freshwater to the coastal zone. The resulting lower salinity, and associated discharge of both nutrients and dissolved organic carbon, may influence food web functioning. The scope of this study was to determine the net outcome of increased freshwater discharge on the balance between auto- and heterotrophic processes in the coastal zone. By using long-term ecological time series data covering 13 similar to years, we show that increased river discharge suppresses phytoplankton biomass production and shifts the carbon flow towards microbial heterotrophy. A 76% increase in freshwater discharge resulted in a 2.2 times higher ratio of bacterio- to phytoplankton production (Pb:Pp). The level of Pb:Pp is a function of riverine total organic carbon supply to the coastal zone. This is mainly due to the negative effect of freshwater and total organic carbon discharge on phytoplankton growth, despite a concomitant increase in discharge of nitrogen and phosphorus. With a time lag of 2 similar to years the bacterial production recovered after an initial decline, further synergistically elevating the microbial heterotrophy. Current climate change projections suggesting increased precipitation may therefore lead to increased microbial heterotrophy, thereby decreasing the transfer efficiency of biomass to higher trophic levels. This prognosis would suggest reduced fish production and lower sedimentation rates of phytoplankton, a factor of detriment to benthic fauna.

Both parasites and predators are important factors shaping community structure and species composition of ecosystems. Here, we simultaneously exposed Daphnia magna to predator cues (released by the tadpole shrimp, Triops, or by a fish) and spores of the yeast parasite Metschnikowia sp. to determine how life history and morphological inducible defences against these two contrasting types of predators are affected by infection. Results: The parasite suppressed some Triops-induced defences: Daphnia lost the ability to produce a greater number of larger offspring, a life-history adaptation to Triops predation. In contrast, the parasite did not suppress inducible defences against fish: induction (resulting in smaller body length of the mothers as well as of their offspring) and infection acted additively on the measured traits. Thus, fish-induced defences may be less costly than inducible defences against small invertebrate predators like Triops; the latter defences could no longer be expressed when the host had already invested in fighting off the parasite. Conclusions: In summary, our study suggests that as specific inducible defences differ in their costs, some might be suppressed if a target prey is additionally infected. Therefore, adding parasite pressure to predator-prey systems can help to elucidate the costs of inducible defences.",5,2012,12,,,,10.1186/1472-6785-12-12"Egea-Serrano, A; Relyea, RA; Tejedo, M; Torralva, M",Understanding of the impact of chemicals on amphibians: a meta-analytic review,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Review,Amphibians; ecotoxicology; meta-analysis; phylogenetic signal; publication bias; synergism,"Many studies have assessed the impact of different pollutants on amphibians across a variety of experimental venues (laboratory, mesocosm, and enclosure conditions). Past reviews, using vote-counting methods, have described pollution as one of the major threats faced by amphibians. However, vote-counting methods lack strong statistical power, do not permit one to determine the magnitudes of effects, and do not compare responses among predefined groups. To address these challenges, we conducted a meta-analysis of experimental studies that measured the effects of different chemical pollutants (nitrogenous and phosphorous compounds, pesticides, road deicers, heavy metals, and other wastewater contaminants) at environmentally relevant concentrations on amphibian survival, mass, time to hatching, time to metamorphosis, and frequency of abnormalities. The overall effect size of pollutant exposure was a medium decrease in amphibian survival and mass and a large increase in abnormality frequency. This translates to a 14.3% decrease in survival, a 7.5% decrease in mass, and a 535% increase in abnormality frequency across all studies. In contrast, we found no overall effect of pollutants on time to hatching and time to metamorphosis. We also found that effect sizes differed among experimental venues and among types of pollutants, but we only detected weak differences among amphibian families. These results suggest that variation in sensitivity to contaminants is generally independent of phylogeny. Some publication bias (i.e., selective reporting) was detected, but only for mass and the interaction effect size among stressors. We conclude that the overall impact of pollution on amphibians is moderately to largely negative.

This was undertaken by analysing diatoms from 100 sample points from hydrologically distinct regions in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Cluster analysis was undertaken using two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN), and groups used to classify sample points in a principal components analysis (PCA) biplot. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was performed using hydrological data and diatom guilds as explanatory variables. A series of ordinations using redundancy analysis (RDA) was undertaken to assess which variables significantly accounted for diatom variation across the Delta. Species-response curves for major taxa were generated using generalized additive models (GAMs). Cluster analysis revealed six distinct groups. Groups 5 and 6 consisted mainly of seasonally inundated floodplain sites, which lay at one end of a significant gradient revealed by PCA. Floodplain diatoms were characteristically N-heterotrophs, requiring elevated concentrations of key resources such as total nitrogen (TN) and SiO2. Using forward selection, constrained RDA reveals five variables were significant in explaining diatom distributions across the Delta: hydroperiod class, flood frequency, flow velocity and nutrients SiO2 and TN. Species-response curves show that motile diatoms were most abundant in seasonally inundated floodplains. Species diversity was significantly higher in the upper Panhandle region of the Delta, which may be related to moderate levels of disturbance and increased resource limitation. Species diversity was significantly lower during the period of maximum flood extent, which may in turn be related to fewer limiting resources.

Plant establishment is critical for community assembly, but mechanisms regulating establishment can be obscured by covarying influences of incoming seed diversity and fine-scale spatial environmental heterogeneity (microhabitat heterogeneity). Both can maximize establishment, depending on whether species differences or environmental variability more fundamentally structures plant communities. 2. We experimentally assembled limestone-pavement herb communities to examine the relative effects of seed diversity and microhabitat heterogeneity on establishment. This included testing (i) whether effects of seed diversity strengthen with heterogeneity, as would be expected if potential niche differences are more strongly expressed in more heterogeneous environments and (ii) whether a greater number of incoming species can establish in more heterogeneous environments due to environmental filtering. Species interaction theory predicts that increased facilitation and niche complementarity with realized diversity has the potential to increase overall community density. 3. Heterogeneity operated independently of seed biodiversity and explained establishment even when spatially averaged microhabitat conditions were accounted for. Homogeneous plots sown with six species supported establishment of plant density that could be increased c. 10% by doubling added seed diversity (while holding heterogeneity constant), but increased c. 40% by holding seed diversity constant and maximizing heterogeneity. 4. Ordinations revealed that species establishment was sorted by gradients in soil pH and surface cover by moss, litter and open bedrock. Regressions indicated more species established in plots featuring a greater diversity of surface cover types and/or greater soil depth variability. Community density increased with established richness, and heterogeneity ceased to explain variance in density once established richness was included as an explanatory variable. All but one of the sown species exhibited increased population density with increased plot richness. 5. Synthesis: Community density in a high-stress environment increased with both fine-scale spatial heterogeneity and added seed diversity. However, these effects were independent of one another, and impacts of heterogeneity were stronger than those of seed diversity. Our results suggest heterogeneity promotes density indirectly, through downstream effects of enhanced establishment diversity such as facilitation.

Here we compared five exploited stocks of European hake Merluccius merluccius from the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea to investigate how the interaction between internal characteristics and external forces affect the variability of the population growth rate and their consequences on recruitment. Our results show that demographic truncation induces a novel population scenario in which the growth rate is maximized when the reproductive stock is younger and less diverse. This scenario is shaped by the climate variability and the fishing pattern. The population growth rate becomes more dependent on the maturation schedule and less on the survival rates. The consequences for the recruitment dynamics are twofold; the effect of density-dependent regulatory processes decreases while the effect of the density-independent drivers increases.

Enhanced seagrass growth in the present study was fully assigned to the removal of lugworms' negative engineering effects and not to any (indirect) evolving effects such as an altered biogeochemistry or sediment-stabilizing effects by the shell layer. The context-dependency implies that seagrass establishment at the exposed site is not constrained by negative ecosystem-engineering interactions only, but also by overriding physical stresses causing poor growth conditions. Present findings underline that, in addition to recent emphasis on considering positive (facilitating) interactions in ecological theory and practice, it is equally important to consider negative engineering interactions between ecosystem-engineering species. Removal of such negative interactions between ecosystem-engineering species can give a head start to the target species at the initial establishment phase, when positive engineering feedbacks by the target species on itself are still lacking. Though our study was carried out in a marine environment with variable levels of wave disturbance, similar principles may be expected to apply to other ecosystems that are inhabited by ecosystem engineers.",11,2012,22,4,1224,1231,"Scarsoglio, S; D'Odorico, P; Laio, F; Ridolfi, L",Spatio-temporal stochastic resonance induces patterns in wetland vegetation dynamics,ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY,Article,Spatio-temporal stochastic resonance; Spatial pattern formation; Wetland vegetation dynamics,"Water availability is a major environmental driver affecting riparian and wetland vegetation.

We investigate the possible emergence of spatial patterns induced by spatio-temporal stochastic resonance in a simple model of groundwater-dependent ecosystems. These spatio-temporal dynamics are driven by the combined effect of three components: (i) an additive white Gaussian noise, accounting for external random disturbances such as fires or fluctuations in rain water availability, (ii) a weak periodic modulation in time, describing hydrological drivers such as seasonal fluctuations of water table depth, and (iii) a spatial coupling term, which takes into account the ability of vegetation to spread and colonize other parts of the landscape. A suitable cooperation between these three terms is able to give rise to ordered structures which show spatial and temporal coherence, and are statistically steady in time. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Thermoregulation and pathogen resistance are two energetically demanding processes that co-occur during seasonal epidemics for many endothermic vertebrates. The ability of hosts to cope with these processes simultaneously may influence population-level disease dynamics. 2. In North American house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus), outbreaks of the bacterium Mycoplasma gallisepticum occur during fall and winter, when ambient temperatures across the hosts range are often below thermoneutrality. Here, we examined how ambient temperature influences host energetics and susceptibility to this naturally occurring seasonal pathogen by experimentally infecting wild-caught house finches with M. gallisepticum at either thermoneutral or subthermoneutral temperatures in the laboratory. We quantified the metabolic costs of infection, measures of body condition, two components of the acute-phase response, disease expression and pathogen loads under both temperature regimes. 3. The metabolic costs of simultaneous infection with M. gallisepticum and thermoregulation were additive and significant (combined costs of 4.71 kJ per night; within the range of the daily energy requirements of passerine moult). Contrary to our predictions, house finches at subthermoneutral temperatures had lower disease expression and higher circulating levels of the cytokine interleukin-6 in response to experimental infection with M. gallisepticum than finches at thermoneutral. However, pathogen loads did not differ between the two temperature treatments. Finches from both treatments expressed fever in response to infection, but the magnitude of fever did not vary with ambient temperature. 4. Despite the significant energy costs of infection and thermoregulation, house finches from both temperature treatments maintained body mass and pectoral muscle condition, suggesting that birds housed at subthermoneutral consumed more food to maintain energy balance. In the field, competition for finite resources would be expected to exacerbate the effects found here and force infected birds to spend more time at feeders where M. gallisepticum is transmitted. 5. Overall, our results indicate that moderate cold stress alters house finch immunity, energetics and disease pathology, but does not alter infectiousness as measured by pathogen load. The effects of ambient temperature on host response and energy demands could directly or indirectly contribute to seasonal and geographical variation in disease dynamics in free-living house finches. More broadly, our results suggest that even subtle changes in abiotic factors such as temperature can alter host disease expression, with broad implications for disease dynamics.",12,2012,26,3,701,710,10.1111/j.1365-2435.2012.01978.x"Bubliy, OA; Kristensen, TN; Kellermann, V; Loeschcke, V",Humidity affects genetic architecture of heat resistance in Drosophila melanogaster,JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,Article,desiccation; environmental stress; genetic variation; heritability; knockdown time; parent-offspring regression; sexual dimorphism; thermal tolerance,"Laboratory experiments on Drosophila have often demonstrated increased heritability for morphological and life-history traits under environmental stress. We used parentoffspring comparisons to examine the impact of humidity levels on the heritability of a physiological trait, resistance to heat, measured as knockdown time at constant temperature. Drosophila melanogaster were reared under standard nonstressful conditions and heat-shocked as adults at extreme high or low humidity. Mean knockdown time was decreased in the stressful dry environment, but there was a significant sex-by-treatment interaction: at low humidity, females were more heat resistant than males, whereas at high humidity, the situation was reversed. Phenotypic variability of knockdown time was also lower in the dry environment. The magnitude of genetic correlation between the sexes at high humidity indicated genetic variation for sexual dimorphism in heat resistance. Heritability estimates based on one-parentoffspring regressions tended to be higher under desiccation stress, and this could be explained by decreased environmental variance of heat resistance at low humidity. There was no indication that the additive genetic variance and evolvability of heat resistance differed between the environments.

Understanding relationships between life histories and environmental variability is therefore crucial for effective conservation under changing environmental conditions. Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) is a species of major conservation concern in western North America following widespread disturbance of the sagebrush ecosystems to which they are endemic. Using robust design and Pradel capture-mark-recapture models, we evaluated the influence of climatic processes and disturbance associated with post-wildfire exotic grass invasion on annual survival, per-capita recruitment, and population growth of breeding male sage-grouse in eastern Nevada, USA. Climatic processes, indexed by annual rainfall and maximum summertime temperatures, had a strong relationship with recruitment and adult survival, respectively. The range of variation in recruitment during the study was greater than the range of variation in survival, consistent with a life-history strategy that features lengthened lifespan to capitalize on periodically favorable reproductive conditions. Annual variation in precipitation variables (e. g., rainfall or snow depth) explained as much as 75% of the annual variance in population size during the study. Our results are consistent with bottom-up regulation of sage-grouse populations, where abundance is determined in large part by climate-driven variation in resource availability. Exotic grasslands had a negative influence on recruitment that was interactive with annual rainfall; recruitment was consistently low in areas with a substantial exotic grassland footprint even following years of favorable rainfall. We found males breeding at leks with substantial exotic grassland impacts had lower annual survival compared to males at leks surrounded by native sagebrush habitats. However, models containing an interaction between exotic grasslands and maximum summer temperature were not clearly superior to models that considered only additive effects of the two variables. This research has significant implications for sage-grouse persistence in a changing climate, where more frequent drought and increased spread of exotic grasslands will have negative impacts on sage-grouse populations.",10,2012,3,6,,,10.1890/ES11-00304.1"Calder, WJ; St Clair, SB",Facilitation drives mortality patterns along succession gradients of aspen-conifer forests,ECOSPHERE,Article,"Abies lasiocarpa; aspen; competition; facilitation; Populus tremuloides; subalpine fir; Utah, USA","While it is well established that facilitation and competition are important structuring forces in plant communities, a clear understanding of the interactions between them and how they change through the life stages of plants and affect long-term plant community development is lacking. We have observed that conifer seedlings are rarely found growing in meadows but readily establish under adjacent aspen stands, particularly at the base of aspen trees, creating the potential for antagonistic interactions in later life stages. To examine these relationships and their potential consequences on forest community development, we characterized patterns of establishment, regeneration, and overstory mortality of aspen (Populus tremuloides) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) along a stand composition gradient (aspen dominant ! mixed ! conifer dominant) that develops in seral aspen forests. We found strong stand effects on the establishment of both aspen and subalpine fir regeneration. Aspen regenerated into meadows from the forest boundary, reached peak densities underneath aspen stands, and decreased significantly in mixed and conifer dominated stands. In contrast, subalpine fir seedlings failed to regenerate in meadows, but established readily underneath aspen, mixed and conifer stands. Within stands, establishing subalpine fir seedlings were strongly aggregated around mature aspen trees, which increased the proximity of the two species 2-10 fold depending on subalpine fir age class and stand type. Both stand type and increased proximity of overstory aspen and fir trees drove mortality patterns of the two species in opposite directions. Overstory aspen mortality increased sharply along the stand composition gradient: aspen (7%), mixed (17%), conifer (49%), while subalpine fir wasn't significantly influenced by stand type. Proximity of overstory aspen and subalpine fir, was associated with increased (23) aspen mortality under all stand conditions but increased subalpine fir survival resulting in high aspen: fir mortality ratios that likely accelerate successional shifts toward conifer dominance.

Transplant studies indicate that areas just across range boundaries are often stressful. The recent Defense constraint (DC) hypothesis for plants states that the evolution of tolerance to stressful environments across a range boundary is constrained by allocation to chemical defense because of antagonistic crosstalk between abiotic and biotic stress signaling pathways that otherwise could be co-opted for range expansion. Abscisic acid (ABA) drought stress tolerance and jasmonic acid/ethylene (JA/ET) defense signaling pathways, for example, are known to be antagonistic to one another in Arabidopsis and other species. To test the DC hypothesis, we examined quantitative genetic variation and co-variation among marker-inferred inbred lines and sib-families of Boechera stricta, a close wild relative of Arabidopsis. The dynamics of the defense-stress tolerance tradeoff was examined across 1) years that differed in precipitation, 2) drought and ABA treatments, and 3) a NPK nutrient supply gradient. In support of the DC hypothesis, we observed the tradeoff a) in the dry year, and b) in response to water deficiency, which c) was affected by ABA treatments, but the interaction between ABA and glucosinolate (GS) toxin levels was not significant. In contrast to the effects of water deficiency, d) the effect of lower NPK supply to cause the tradeoff was only marginally significant.

For the butterfly Speyeria mormonia, one climate driver, snow melt date, has multiple effects on population growth. Snow melt date in year t has density-dependent indirect effects. Through frost effects, early snow melt decreases floral resources, thence per-capita nectar availability, which determines fecundity in the lab. Snow melt date in year t + 1 has density-independent direct effects. These effects explain 84% of the variation in population growth rate.

Of the 2546 individually-identified trees that were re-sampled, 290 (11.4%) died in the interim. We tested several competing hypotheses with varying levels of complexity, and found that mortality of large trees was affected mainly by both static (geophysical and landscape characteristics) and dynamic (elephant damage and fire) factors that were either additive or interactive in their effects. Elephant damage was the main predictor of tree mortality, but fire also played an important role depending on the landscape type. Other static variables such as position-on-slope, height below canopy, and altitude had weak effects in explaining tree mortality. These results indicate that keystone features such as large trees, show differential vulnerability to mortality that is landscape-specific. For conservation managers, this implies that the dynamic drivers (elephant and fire) of tree mortality have to be managed at the specific landscape-level. We suggest that this emergent biocomplexity in the spatial and temporal patterns of large tree mortality is not unique to the African savannas, but is likely widespread across heterogeneous landscapes.",16,2012,35,4,315,321,10.1111/j.1600-0587.2011.07213.x"Verburg, PH; Koomen, E; Hilferink, M; Perez-Soba, M; Lesschen, JP",An assessment of the impact of climate adaptation measures to reduce flood risk on ecosystem services,LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,Article,Climate change adaptation; Integrated spatial modelling; Land use; Ecosystem services; Flood risk; Soil protection,"Measures of climate change adaptation often involve modification of land use and land use planning practices. Such changes in land use affect the provision of various ecosystem goods and services. Therefore, it is likely that adaptation measures may result in synergies and trade-offs between a range of ecosystems goods and services. An integrative land use modelling approach is presented to assess such impacts for the European Union. A reference scenario accounts for current trends in global drivers and includes a number of important policy developments that correspond to on-going changes in European policies. The reference scenario is compared to a policy scenario in which a range of measures is implemented to regulate flood risk and protect soils under conditions of climate change. The impacts of the simulated land use dynamics are assessed for four key indicators of ecosystem service provision: flood risk, carbon sequestration, habitat connectivity and biodiversity. The results indicate a large spatial variation in the consequences of the adaptation measures on the provisioning of ecosystem services. Synergies are frequently observed at the location of the measures itself, whereas trade-offs are found at other locations. Reducing land use intensity in specific parts of the catchment may lead to increased pressure in other regions, resulting in trade-offs. Consequently, when aggregating the results to larger spatial scales the positive and negative impacts may be off-set, indicating the need for detailed spatial assessments. The modelled results indicate that for a careful planning and evaluation of adaptation measures it is needed to consider the trade-offs accounting for the negative effects of a measure at locations distant from the actual measure.

For example, the recent, range-wide decline of the Allegheny woodrat (Neotoma magister) is likely a result of numerous, minor, human-mediated stressors including habitat fragmentation and disruption of metapopulation dynamics, reduced hard mast availability associated with the functional extirpation of American chestnut (Castanea dentata) and recent shifts in forest composition, and expansion of a human-adapted species, the raccoon (Procyon lotor) and the parasites it carries (Baylisascaris procyonis). To evaluate the assertion that range-wide woodrat declines have been caused by a concatenate of stressors, we used principal component (PC) analysis to identify latent relationships among a suite of biological and ecological factors (reflecting those stressors listed above) and evaluated PC scores relative to the three conservation states of woodrat populations in Indiana (stable, diminished and extirpated). Populations of differing conservation states segregated along each of the three retained PCs, providing support for the assertion that a combination of stressors has contributed to the range-wide decline of woodrat metapopulations, although intriguingly, independent stressors appeared to cause the decline of individual populations. These results suggest specific, minimal site attributes must be met for each of the habitat attributes evaluated to support stable woodrat populations. Our findings further suggest that variation in relative pressures exerted by individual stressors across populations will require site-specific management actions if woodrat populations are to be recovered throughout their range.

This pattern of proteomic divergence was consistent with the previously reported gene expression data. In particular, many non-additively accumulated proteins (61-62%) in the F-1 and F-8 allotetraploids were also differentially expressed between the parents. The differentially accumulated proteins in functional categories of abiotic and biotic stresses were overrepresented between an A. thaliana autotetraploid and diploid and between two Arabidopsis species, but not significantly different between allotetraploids and their progenitors. Although the trend of changes is similar, the percentage of differentially accumulated proteins that matched previously reported differentially expressed genes was relatively low. Western blot analysis confirmed several selected proteins with isoforms the cumulative levels of which were differentially expressed.

We find that current climate and climate change are important factors determining the negative effects of habitat loss on species density and/or diversity. The most important determinant of habitat loss and fragmentation effects, averaged across species and geographic regions, was current maximum temperature, with mean precipitation change over the last 100 years of secondary importance. Habitat loss and fragmentation effects were greatest in areas with high maximum temperatures. Conversely, they were lowest in areas where average rainfall has increased over time.

Null models that systematically exclude and include habitat effects can give information on the contribution of these factors to community assembly. In the boreal forest, saproxylic beetles are known to be attracted to recently burned forests where they breed in dead and dying trees. We examined whether species co-occurrences of saproxylic beetles that develop in, and emerge from, boles of recently burned trees show non-random patterns. We also estimated the extent to which both the post-fire habitat attributes and interspecific interactions among beetles contribute to such patterns. We sampled tree boles encompassing key attributes (tree species, tree size/dbh and burn severity) that are thought to characterize species-habitat associations of saproxylic beetles, a proposition that we tested using indicator species analysis. Two null models with no habitat constraints (""unconstrained"") indicated that a total of 29.4% of the species pairs tested had significant co-occurrence patterns. Habitat-constrained null models indicated that most of the detected species aggregations (72%) and segregations (59%) can be explained by shared and distinct species-habitat relationships, respectively. The assembly pattern was also driven by interspecific interactions, of which some were modulated by habitat; for example, predator and prey species tended to co-occur in large-sized trees (a proxy of available bark/wood food resource primarily for the prey). In addition, some species segregation suggesting antagonistic, competitive, or prey-predator interactions were evident after accounting for the species' affinities for the same tree species. Overall, our results suggest that an intimate link between habitat and interspecific interactions can have important roles for community assembly of saproxylic assemblages even following disturbance by fire.

Development and exploitation mean that they are faced with stresses from a number of anthropogenic sources. Such stresses are typically studied in isolation, but multiple stressors can combine in unexpected ways to alter the structure of ecological systems. Here, we experimentally explore the impacts of inorganic nutrients and organic matter on a range of food web properties. We find that these two stressors combine additively to produce significant increases in connectance and mean food chain length. Such increases are typically associated with enhanced robustness to secondary extinctions and productivity, respectively. Despite these apparent beneficial effects, we find a simplification of web structure in terms of taxon richness and diversity, and altered proportions of basal and top species. These effects are driven by a reduction in community assembly and lower consistency in a range of system properties as a result of the multiple stressors. Consequently, impacted food webs are likely to be more vulnerable to human- or climate-induced perturbations in the long term.",18,2012,93,3,441,448,"Miller, GR; Cable, JM; McDonald, AK; Bond, B; Franz, TE; Wang, LX; Gou, S; Tyler, AP; Zou, CB; Scott, RL",Understanding ecohydrological connectivity in savannas: a system dynamics modelling approach,ECOHYDROLOGY,Article,cross-scale interactions; feedbacks; resilience; disturbance; system dynamics; soil moisture dynamics; evapotranspiration,"Ecohydrological connectivity is a system level property that results from the linkages in the networks of water transport through ecosystems, by which feedbacks and other emergent system behaviours may be generated. We created a system dynamics model that represents primary ecohydrological networks to examine how connectivity between ecosystem components impacts ecosystem processes. Here, we focused on the savanna ecosystems, although the analyses may be expanded to other ecosystem types in the future. To create the model, a set of differential equations representing ecohydrological processes was programmed into the dynamic solver Vensim. Stocks of water storage (e.g. atmospheric and soil moisture) were linked by flows [e.g. precipitation and evapotranspiration (ET)] that were in turn dynamically controlled by the amount of water stored. Precipitation was forced stochastically, and soil moisture and potential ET controlled actual ET. The model produced extended, probabilistic time series of stocks and flows, including precipitation, soil moisture, runoff, transpiration, and groundwater recharge. It was used to describe the behaviour of several previously studied savanna ecosystems in North America and Africa. The model successfully reproduced seasonal patterns of soil moisture dynamics and ET at the California site. It also demonstrated more complex, system level behaviours, such as multiyear persistence of drought and synergistic or antagonistic responses to disconnection of system components. Future improvements to the model will focus on capturing other important aspects of long-term system behaviour, such as changes in physiology or phenology, and spatial heterogeneity, such as the patchwork nature of savannas.

However, less attention is given to the potential unintended effects on nontarget species, including taxonomic groups that are of current conservation concern. One issue raised in recent years is the potential for pesticides to become more lethal in the presence of predatory cues, a phenomenon observed thus far only in the laboratory. A second issue is whether pesticides can induce unintended trait changes in nontarget species, particularly trait changes that might mimic adaptive responses to natural environmental stressors. Using outdoor mesocosms, I created simple wetland communities containing leaf litter, algae, zooplankton, and three species of tadpoles (wood frogs [Rana sylvatica or Lithobates sylvaticus], leopard frogs [R. pipiens or L. pipiens], and American toads [Bufo americanus or Anaxyrus americanus]). I exposed the communities to a factorial combination of environmentally relevant herbicide concentrations (0, 1, 2, or 3 mg acid equivalents [a.e.]/L of Roundup Original MAX) crossed with three predator-cue treatments (no predators, adult newts [Notophthalmus viridescens], or larval dragonflies [A flax junius]). Without predator cues, mortality rates from Roundup were consistent with past studies. Combined with cues from the most risky predator (i.e., dragonflies), Roundup became less lethal (in direct contrast to past laboratory studies). This reduction in mortality was likely caused by the herbicide stratifying in the water column and predator cues scaring the tadpoles down to the benthos where herbicide concentrations were lower. Even more striking was the discovery that Roundup induced morphological changes in the tadpoles. In wood frog and leopard frog tadpoles, Roundup induced relatively deeper tails in the same direction and of the same magnitude as the adaptive changes induced by dragonfly cues. To my knowledge, this is the first study to show that a pesticide can induce morphological changes in a vertebrate. Moreover, the data suggest that the herbicide might be activating the tadpoles' developmental pathways used for antipredator responses. Collectively, these discoveries suggest that the world's most widely applied herbicide may have much further-reaching effects on nontarget species than previous considered.",27,2012,22,2,634,647,"Watson, SJ; Taylor, RS; Nimmo, DG; Kelly, LT; Haslem, A; Clarke, MF; Bennett, AF",Effects of time since fire on birds: How informative are generalized fire response curves for conservation management?,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,Article,birds; chronosequence; conservation; disturbance; fire; mallee; semiarid shrubland; southeastern Australia; succession; time since fire,"Fire is both a widespread natural disturbance that affects the distribution of species and a tool that can be used to manage habitats for species. Knowledge of temporal changes in the occurrence of species after fire is essential for conservation management in fire-prone environments. Two key issues are: whether postfire responses of species are idiosyncratic or if multiple species show a limited number of similar responses; and whether such responses to time since fire can predict the occurrence of species across broad spatial scales. We examined the response of bird species to time since fire in semiarid shrubland in southeastern Australia using data from surveys at 499 sites representing a 100-year chronosequence. We used nonlinear regression to model the probability of occurrence of 30 species with time since. fire in two vegetation types, and compared species' responses with generalized response shapes from the literature. The occurrence of 16 species was significantly influenced by time since fire: they displayed six main responses consistent with generalized response shapes. Of these 16 species, 15 occurred more frequently in mid- or later-successional vegetation (>20 years since fire), and only one species occurred more often in early succession (<5 years since fire). The models had reasonable predictive ability for eight species, some predictive ability for seven species, and were little better than random for one species. Bird species displayed a limited range of responses to time since fire; thus a small set of fire ages should allow the provision of habitat for most species. Postfire successional changes extend for decades and management of the age class distribution of vegetation will need to reflect this timescale. Response curves revealed important seral stages for species and highlighted the importance of mid- to late-successional vegetation (>20 years). Although time since fire clearly influences the distribution of numerous bird species, predictive models of the spatial distribution of species in fire-prone landscapes need to incorporate other factors in addition to time since fire.",24,2012,22,2,685,696,"Brodie, J; Post, E; Laurance, WF",Climate change and tropical biodiversity: a new focus,TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION,Article,,"Considerable efforts are focused on the consequences of climate change for tropical rainforests.

There is much evidence to show that climate change may influence Daphnia population dynamics, consequently altering both predator-prey interactions and the efficiency of algal biomass control in these ecosystems. This review will analyse and discuss the current knowledge on Daphnia responses to climate warming based on an analysis of selected papers. The presented results indicate that warming may have important direct and indirect effects on Daphnia biology and ecology via its influence on their life-history processes (metabolism, growth, reproduction) and the properties of their habitats. The plasticity of daphnids in terms of adaptive responses is generally high and includes phenotypic adaptations and changes in genotypes, although it also depends upon the strength of selection and the available genetic variation. The seasonal timing and magnitude of temperature increases are important for seasonal biomass fluctuations of Daphnia and similarly influence the potential synchrony of daphnids and phytoplankton succession (the timing hypothesis). In light of the most recent studies on this topic, even a minor warming during short but critical seasonal periods can cause factors that disturb Daphnia population dynamics to coincide, which may destabilize lake food webs by decoupling trophic interactions. Both winter and spring are important critical periods for determining future seasonal fluxes of Daphnia spp. and, consequently, the time of the clear-water phase and the occurrence and duration of Daphnia midsummer decline. Winter conditions may also affect the impact of fish predation on daphnids during summer months. However, the effects of global warming on Daphnia population dynamics and on ecosystem functioning are often difficult to predict due to their complexity and the presence of both antagonistic and synergistic drivers. Thus, the diverse responses of daphnids to climate anomalies depend on both biotic (predator abundance and seasonal phytoplankton succession) and abiotic factors (e.g. hydrodynamics, intensity and duration of thermal stratification, trophic state or geomorphology) of lakes, which are directly influenced by weather changes. The analysis and quantification of such complex interactions require the involvement of different kinds of specialists and the development of accurate research approaches, such as molecular genetic methods or mathematical modelling.",13,2012,46,1,37,53,10.1007/s10452-011-9380-x"Li, ZH; Lu, GH; Yang, XF; Wang, C",Single and combined effects of selected pharmaceuticals at sublethal concentrations on multiple biomarkers in Carassius auratus,ECOTOXICOLOGY,Article,Caffeine; Sulfamethoxazole; Biomarker; Carassius auratus,"In this study, the sublethal effects of caffeine, sulfamethoxazole and their mixture on goldfish (Carassius auratus) were investigated, the biomarkers including acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in brain, 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in liver and vitellogenin (VTG) in serum were determined after 1, 2, 4, and 7 days of exposure.

A mathematical model (to be published separately) of the gene regulatory circuit controlling mtl production predicted that chemically similar divalent metals (classic inducers) should show additive effects on mtl gene induction, whereas chemically dissimilar metals should show interference. These predictions were verified experimentally; thus cadmium and mercury showed additive effects, whereas ferric iron (a weak inducer) significantly reduced the effect of mercury. We applied a similar battery of tests to diluted samples of soil pore water extracted centrifugally after mixing 20% w/w ultrapure water with air-dried soil from an abandoned lead/zinc mine in the Murcia region of Spain. In addition, metal contents of both soil and soil pore water were determined by ICP-MS, and simplified mixtures of soluble metal salts were tested at equivalent final concentrations. The effects of extracted soil pore water (after tenfold dilution) were closely mimicked by mixtures of its principal component ions, and even by the single most prevalent contaminant (zinc) alone, though other metals modulated its effects both positively and negatively.

Daphnids, which are important grazers on phytoplankton and a major food source for fish and invertebrates, are sensitive to not only changes in salinity levels, but also presence of predators. In this study, the interactive effect of salinity toxicity (abiotic factor) with predation pressure mimicked by the fish-exuded kairomone (biotic factor) and the effect of salt acclimation on daphnids were investigated. Impacts of these stressors on daphnid survival, life history and molecular profile were observed. The presence of the kairomone antagonistically alters the effect of salinity, as observed from the 24- and 48-h LC50 values and survival results. Molecular findings provided solid evidence to this antagonism at even lower salt concentrations, for which antagonism was not evident with organismal data. Fish predation counterbalances the negative effect of salinity in terms of reserve energy density. Therefore, it is important to investigate multiple stressor effects in ecotoxicological bioassays complemented with molecular techniques. The single effect of increasing salinity resulted in increased mortality, decreased fecundity, and slower somatic growth in Daphnia, despite their acclimation to salinity. This insignificance of acclimation indicates that Daphnia do not have any physiological mechanisms to buffer the adverse effects of salinity, making it a very crucial factor.

Alarmingly, bees were attracted to, and consumed more, nectar from a treatment that reduced their survival by 22%.

Yet seed dispersal interacts decisively with the major drivers of biodiversity change in the 21st century: habitat fragmentation, overharvesting, biological invasions, and climate change. We synthesize current knowledge of the effects these drivers have on seed dispersal to identify research gaps and to show how this information can be used to improve conservation management. The drivers, either individually, or in combination, have changed the quantity, species composition, and spatial pattern of dispersed seeds in the majority of ecosystems worldwide, with inevitable consequences for species survival in a rapidly changing world. The natural history of seed dispersal is now well-understood in a range of landscapes worldwide. Only a few generalizations that have emerged are directly applicable to conservation management, however, because they are frequently confounded by site-specific and species-specific variation. Potentially synergistic interactions between disturbances are likely to exacerbate the negative impacts, but these are rarely investigated. We recommend that the conservation status of functionally unique dispersers be revised and that the conservation target for key seed dispersers should be a population size that maintains their ecological function, rather than merely the minimum viable population. Based on our analysis of conservation needs, seed dispersal research should be carried out at larger spatial scales in heterogenous landscapes, examining the simultaneous impacts of multiple drivers on community-wide seed dispersal networks.

Global increases in ultraviolet-B radiation (UVBR) associated with stratospheric ozone depletion are thought to be contributing to the rapid disappearance of amphibian populations from pristine habitats around the world. Much research has been dedicated to understanding the effects of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) alone and in combination with other environmental stressors on the early life stages of amphibians. Little is known, however, of how UVR affects amphibian metabolism, or how amphibian metabolism may change in response to exposure to other stressors in addition to UVR. 2. Using a controlled laboratory experiment, we examined the independent and interactive effects of UVR and non-lethal predatory chemical cues (PCC) on the tissue and whole-animal metabolic rate (MR) and activity of striped marsh frog Limnodynastes peronii tadpoles. PCC signal risk of predation, which is a natural stressor that can cause tadpoles to alter their behaviour, morphology, and life history, and for which the metabolic cost remains little explored. 3. We found that exposure to UVR caused tissue MR to increase by 36%, but whole-animal MR to decrease by 14%, which is most likely due to tadpoles reducing their activity levels by 56%. Exposure to PCC had no significant effect on tissue or whole-animal MR, but caused tadpoles to reduce their activity levels by 36%, indicating that the whole-animal MR of tadpoles exposed to PCC is elevated relative to their activity levels. Compared with tadpoles exposed to neither stressor, tadpoles exposed simultaneously to UVR and PCC showed no change in whole-animal MR despite reducing their activity levels by 62%. 4. This research shows that, for tadpoles, there is an energetic cost associated with being exposed to UVR and PCC independently, and that this cost is greater when they are exposed to both stressors simultaneously. Our previous research has shown that exposure of tadpoles to PCC enhances the lethal effects of UVR, and the present study suggests that this synergistic interaction may arise as a consequence of the effect of these combined stressors on MR. Global increases in UVBR may therefore be contributing to amphibian population declines by compromising energy allocation towards growth and development as well as energy allocation towards coping with additional environmental stressors.",11,2012,26,1,94,103,10.1111/j.1365-2435.2011.01900.x"Orledge, JM; Blount, JD; Hoodless, AN; Pike, TW; Royle, NJ","Synergistic effects of supplementation of dietary antioxidants during growth on adult phenotype in ring-necked pheasants, Phasianus colchicus",FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,Article,carotenoids; oxidative stress; sexual selection; vitamin E,"1. Oxidative stress may provide a proximate link between investment in growth and/or reproduction and investment in self-maintenance. Dietary antioxidants, such as carotenoids and vitamin E, provide potentially important roles in regulating these trade-offs. Recent work suggests that carotenoids may have synergistic effects in combination with non-pigmentary antioxidants (e.g. vitamin E) on the expression of sexually selected traits in adulthood. However, these studies involved the supplementation of antioxidants to adults so did not take account of early life-history effects. 2. Here, we test the independent and combined roles of supplementation of carotenoids and vitamin E during early growth in regulating the expression of traits in adulthood, in ring-necked pheasants, Phasianus colchicus. Individuals supplemented with a combination of carotenoids and vitamin E were larger at adulthood than individuals receiving other treatment diets (including vitamin E or carotenoids alone), but there were no differences in ornament expression, immune function, the swelling response to phytohaemagglutinin or levels of oxidative damage. 3.

Does grazing favour plants with arid affinity over those with less arid affinity? Does the grazing-induced transformation constitute a switch to the equivalent of a shrub-dominated biome? Location: Central South Africa. Methods: Using systematic scanning of SPOT 5 imagery and ground-truthing, a grazing treatment area was selected that met criteria of intensity of grazing, sampling requirements, and biogeographical position within a broad ecotonal zone. Differential vegetation responses to heavy grazing were tested for significant differences in plant traits, vegetation structure, and species diversity, richness and evenness. Gamma diversity was calculated for the whole study site, whereas, independent beta diversity was calculated across the treatments assuming the additive partitioning of diversity. In addition, the biogeographical association of grazing-induced species shifts was determined using a range of available databases. Results: Canopy cover and height of woody shrubs increased significantly with heavy grazing whereas that of graminoid plants declined. The resultant species turnover was modest, apparent extinctions of local species were minimal, species richness was maintained and species diversity was significantly enhanced. There was a significant increase in species evenness, through possible suppression of dominant species. Significant increases in species cover were those associated with mainly the Nama-Karoo biome indicating that species from more arid areas are more resistant to grazing as would be expected by the convergence model of aridity and grazing resistance. Conclusions: The significant increase in shrub cover in heavily grazed semi-arid grassland followed general global expectations. The study confirmed that the supposed former large shift of grassland to shrubby Nama-Karoo in the eastern upper Karoo can indeed be readily affected by heavy grazing. The negative connotations for biodiversity that have often been associated with intense grazing seem, in terms of the positive responses of plant species diversity in this study, to perhaps be exaggerated.

We consider the effects of this key driver of both local and global change on both mutualistic and antagonistic systems at different levels of biological organisation and spatiotemporal scales. There is a complex interplay of patterns and processes related to the variation and influence of spatial, temporal and biotic drivers in ecological networks. Species traits (e.g. body size, dispersal ability) play an important role in determining how networks respond to fragment size and isolation, edge shape and permeability, and the quality of the surrounding landscape matrix. Furthermore, the perception of spatial scale (e.g. environmental grain) and temporal effects (time lags, extinction debts) can differ markedly among species, network modules and trophic levels, highlighting the need to develop a more integrated perspective that considers not just nodes, but the structural role and strength of species interactions (e.g. as hubs, spatial couplers and determinants of connectance, nestedness and modularity) in response to habitat fragmentation. Many challenges remain for improving our understanding: the likely importance of specialisation, functional redundancy and trait matching has been largely overlooked. The potentially critical effects of apex consumers, abundant species and supergeneralists on network changes and evolutionary dynamics also need to be addressed in future research. Ultimately, spatial and ecological networks need to be combined to explore the effects of dispersal, colonisation, extinction and habitat fragmentation on network structure and coevolutionary dynamics.

At the same time, the dissolution of CO2 into seawater is increasing surface ocean acidity, a process known as ocean acidification. Effects of ocean acidification on marine primary producers have been documented to be stimulative, inhibitive, or neutral. Elevated CO2 and reduced pH levels can interact with solar radiation, which fluctuates over different time scales from limiting to saturating or even stressful levels, to bring about synergistic, antagonistic, or balanced effects on marine primary producers at different depths or under changing weather conditions. However, shoaling of the upper mixed layer (enhanced stratification) due to ocean warming and freshening (rain, ice melting) can lead to additional photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and ultraviolet (UV) exposure, which can have both benefits and costs to photosynthetic organisms. Elevated CO2 concentrations under low or moderate levels of PAR have been shown to enhance photosynthesis or growth of both phytoplankton and macroalgae; excessive levels of PAR, however, can lead to additional inhibition of photosynthesis or growth under elevated CO2, and addition of UV radiation (280 to 400 nm) can increase or down-regulate such inhibition, since solar UV-B (280 to 315 nm) radiation often harms algal cells, while UV-A (315 to 400 nm) at moderate levels stimulates photosynthetic carbon fixation in both phytoplankton and macroalgae. In view of warming effects, increased temperatures have been shown to enhance photorepair of UV-damaged molecules, though it simultaneously enhances respiratory carbon loss. The net effects of ocean acidification on marine primary producers are therefore largely dependent on the photobiological conditions (light limitation, light or UV stress), as well as interactions with rising temperature and other variables such as altered nutrient availability. Hence, feedbacks between changing carbonate chemistry and solar radiation across the entire spectrum present complications to interpret and understand ocean acidification effects based on single-factor experiments.",45,2012,470,,167,189,10.3354/meps10043"Portner, HO",Integrating climate-related stressor effects on marine organisms: unifying principles linking molecule to ecosystem-level changes,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,Article,Ocean warming; Hypoxia; Acidification; Climate change; Ecosystem change; Aerobic scope; Energy budget; Mechanism-based projections,"Climate change effects on marine ecosystems involve various stressors, predominantly temperature, hypoxia and CO2, all of which may combine with further anthropogenic stressors such as pollutants. All life forms respond to these drivers, following potentially common principles, which are insufficiently understood. Specific understanding may be most advanced in animals where the concept of 'oxygen and capacity dependent thermal tolerance' (OCLTT) is an integrator of various effects, linking molecular to ecosystem levels of biological organisation. Recent studies confirm OCLTT involvement in the field, causing changes in species abundance, biogeographical ranges, phenology and species predominance. At the whole-animal level, performance capacity set by aerobic scope and energy budget, building on baseline energy turnover, links fitness (within a thermal window) and functioning at the ecosystem level. In variable environments like the intertidal zone, animals also exploit their capacity for passive tolerance. While presently the temperature signal appears predominant in the field, effects may well involve other stressors, acting synergistically by narrowing the aerobic OCLTT window. Recent findings support the OCLTT concept as a common physiological basis linking apparently disjunct effects of ocean warming, acidification and hypoxia in a so-called climate syndrome. In brief, warming-induced CO2 accumulation in body fluids links to the effects of ocean acidification mediated by the weak acid distribution of CO2. Temperature-induced hypoxemia links to the hypoxia sensitivity of thermal tolerance. Future work will need to develop proxies for the temperature-dependent effects of climate-related stressors and also identify the principles operative in organisms other than animals and their underlying mechanisms.

Our primary objective here was to analyse post-fire accumulation of Cajander larch (Larix cajanderi Mayr.) aboveground biomass for a 100 000 km(2) area of open forest in far northeastern Siberia. In addition to examining effects of fire size and topography on post-fire larch aboveground biomass, we assessed regional fire rotation and density, as well as performance of burned area maps generated from MODIS satellite imagery. Using Landsat imagery, we mapped 116 fire scar perimeters that dated c. 1966-2007. We then mapped larch aboveground biomass by linking field biomass measurements to tree shadows mapped synergistically from WorldView-1 and Landsat 5 satellite imagery. Larch aboveground biomass tended to be low during early succession (<= 25 yr, 271+/-26 gm(-2), n = 66 [mean+/-SE]) and decreased with increasing elevation and northwardly aspect. Larch aboveground biomass tended to be higher during mid-succession (33-38 yr, 746+/-100 gm(-2), n = 32), though was highly variable. The high variability was not associated with topography and potentially reflected differences in post-fire density of tree regrowth. Neither fire size nor latitude were significant predictors of post-fire larch aboveground biomass. Fire activity was considerably higher in the Kolyma Mountains (fire rotation = 110 yr, fire density = 1.0+/-1.0 fires yr(-1) x 10(4) km(-2)) than along the forest-tundra border (fire rotation = 792 yr, fire density = 0.3+/-0.3 fires yr(-1) x 10(4) km(-2)). The MODIS burned area maps underestimated the total area burned in this region from 2000-2007 by 40%. Tree shadows mapped jointly using high and medium resolution satellite imagery were strongly associated (r(2) approximate to 0.9) with field measurements of forest structure, which permitted spatial extrapolation of aboveground biomass to a regional extent.

In grasslands, land use is often classified by categorical descriptors such as pastures versus meadows or fertilized versus unfertilized sites. However, to account for the quantitative variation of multiple land-use types in heterogeneous landscapes, a quantitative, continuous index of land-use intensity (LUI) is desirable. Here we define such a compound, additive LUI index for managed grasslands including meadows and pastures. The LUI index summarizes the standardized intensity of three components of land use, namely fertilization, mowing, and livestock grazing at each site. We examined the performance of the LUI index to predict selected response variables on up to 150 grassland sites in the Biodiversity Exploratories in three regions in Germany(Alb, Hainich, Schorlheide). We tested the average Ellenberg nitrogen indicator values of the plant community, nitrogen and phosphorus concentration in the aboveground plant biomass, plant-available phosphorus concentration in the top soil, and soil C/N ratio, and the first principle component of these five response variables. The LUI index significantly predicted the principal component of all five response variables, as well as some of the individual responses. Moreover, vascular plant diversity decreased significantly with LUI in two regions (Alb and Hainich). Inter-annual changes in management practice were pronounced from 2006 to 2008, particularly due to variation in grazing intensity. This rendered the selection of the appropriate reference year(s) an important decision for analyses of land-use effects, whereas details in the standardization of the index were of minor importance. We also tested several alternative calculations of a LUI index, but all are strongly linearly correlated to the proposed index. The proposed LUI index reduces the complexity of agricultural practices to a single dimension and may serve as a baseline to test how different groups of organisms and processes respond to land use. In combination with more detailed analyses, this index may help to unravel whether and how land-use intensities, associated disturbance levels or other local or regional influences drive ecological processes.",52,2012,13,3,207,220,10.1016/j.baae.2012.04.001"Noonan, SHC; Jones, GP; Pratchett, MS","Coral size, health and structural complexity: effects on the ecology of a coral reef damselfish",MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,Article,Chromis retrofasciata; Coral reef; Reef fish; Habitat structure; Habitat complexity; Predation; Seriatopora; Survivorship,"The structure and dynamics of animal populations are strongly influenced by the physical and biotic characteristics of their habitats.

This study investigates the influence of coral colony size, health and branching structure of the host coral Seriatopora hystrix on the ecology of the resident damselfish Chromis retrofasciata. Field observations indicated C. retrofasciata preferentially occupied larger S. hystrix colonies, but among occupied corals, group size was greatest on colonies of an intermediate size and with wider branch spacing. Healthy corals were observed to support higher abundances. The effects of both coral health (live vs. dead) and coral complexity (fine, medium and coarse branching) on survivorship of stocked juvenile C. retrofasciata were examined in a patch reef experiment. Survival was 20% higher in living colonies compared to dead ones, and fish in medium complexity coral exhibited approximately 10 and 20% greater survival than those in both the low and high complexity categories, respectively. These factors had an additive effect with the highest survival observed on healthy colonies with intermediate complexity (95%) and the lowest on highly complex, dead corals (55%). Body size distributions were also reduced on corals with the narrowest branch spacing. During habitat selection trials, juveniles were observed to preferentially occupy colonies with intermediate branch spacing. Prey may prefer corals of intermediate spacing and survive better as such habitats provide shelter that obstructs predator access. This study provides evidence that suggests small reef fish species will be sensitive to disturbances that result in the loss of live coral and alter preferred structural complexity of habitats.",6,2012,456,,127,137,10.3354/meps09687"Witt, V; Wild, C; Uthicke, S",Interactive climate change and runoff effects alter O-2 fluxes and bacterial community composition of coastal biofilms from the Great Barrier Reef,AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,Article,Light; Nitrate; Temperature; Water quality; Terrestrial runoff; Coral reef,"Global (i.e. ocean warming) and local (i.e. land runoff) anthropogenic disturbances affect coastal coral reefs worldwide. Terrestrial runoff, leading to reduced light and increased nutrient availability, may have interactive effects with ocean warming in promoting shifts in benthic communities. Because microbial biofilms rapidly reflect environmental changes, we investigated the quantitative (C, N and chlorophyll a contents) and qualitative (microbial community composition) parameters and metabolic responses (O-2 fluxes) of biofilms established on glass slides to combinations of manipulated water temperatures (26, 29 and 31 degrees C), nitrate (0.5, 1.0 and 1.4 mu M), and light availabilities (40 and 200 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) in a 28 d flow-through aquarium experiment. The findings revealed that, independent of light availability, a temperature of 31 degrees C significantly decreased the 24 h net O-2 production and all of the quantitative parameters. Under high light, additive effects of 31 degrees C and 1.4 mu M nitrate reduced the 24 h net O-2 production. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (T-RFLP) of 16S rRNA genes showed light-independent temperature-induced microbial community shifts driven by increases in the relative abundance of Oceanospirillum (Gammaproteobacteria) and decreases of Cyanobacteria. The relative abundances of diatom plastids increased in response to elevated nitrate only in high-light-exposed biofilms. Overall, high temperatures altered microbial biofilm community composition, biomass and productivity. Under predicted near-future inner reef scenarios (low light and high nitrate availability), biofilms become light-limited through sedimentation, while outer (high light and low nitrate availability) inshore reef biofilms remain nitrate-limited.

Plant communities often exhibit rapidly saturating or even hump-shaped age-flammability trajectories and landscapes often display strong non-linear behaviors, abrupt shifts, and self-reinforcing alternative community states. This plethora of fire-landscape interactions calls for a more general model that considers alternative age-flammability rules. We simulated landscape dynamics assuming communities that (1) increase in flammability with age and (2) gain flammability up to a certain age followed by a slight and moderate loss to a constant value. Simulations were run under combinations of ignition frequency and interannual climatic variability. Age-increasing fire probability promoted high resilience to changes in ignition frequency and climatic variability whereas humpbacked-shaped age-flammability led to strong non-linear behaviors. Moderate (20%) reductions in mature compared to peak flammability produced the least resilient behaviors. The relatively nonflammable mature forest matrix intersected by young flammable patches is prone to break up and disintegrate with slight increases in ignition/climate variability causing large-scale shifts in the fire regime because large fires were able to sweep through the more continuous young/flammable landscape. Contrary to the dominant perception, fire suppression in landscapes with positive feedbacks may effectively reduce fire occurrence by allowing less flammable later stage communities composed of longer lived, obligate seeders to replace earlier stages of light demanding, often more flammable resprouters. Conversely, increases in anthropogenic ignitions, a common global trend of many forested regions may, in synergism with increased climate variability, induce abrupt shifts, and large-scale forest degradation.",20,2012,15,1,97,112,10.1007/s10021-011-9494-y"Moy, FE; Christie, H",Large-scale shift from sugar kelp (Saccharina latissima) to ephemeral algae along the south and west coast of Norway,MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH,Article,Climate change; community change; eutrophication; macroalgae; turf algae,"Sugar kelp forests (Saccharina latissima) normally dominate the sublittoral rocky sea bed in medium exposed to sheltered areas of the Norwegian coast. In 2002, a large-scale disappearance of sugar kelp was observed, and a survey of more than 600 sites along the coast of southern Norway (58-63 degrees N, 6-11 degrees E) during 2004-2009 recorded a large-scale shift from anticipated sugar kelp forests to communities dominated by filamentous, ephemeral macroalgae. The loss of sugar kelp was most severe in the Skagerrak region, and a comparison with earlier studies supported the observed changes in the community structure and regional differences between the Skagerrak region and the west coast. Filamentous red algae dominated the sublittoral communities at the Skagerrak coast, whereas coarsely branched and filamentous brown algae were most abundant at the west coast sites with low or no abundance of sugar kelp. The cause of this large-scale shift is not clear, but our observations suggest eutrophication (nutrient and particle pollution) and climate change (increase in temperature) as the two main drivers synergistically contributing, alongside other factors, to the demise of S. latissima.

Mitigation measures to reduce risk of collisions may be based on information given by wildlife movement and collision data. To test whether movement and collision data indicate different spatiotemporal risk zones, we predicted year-around probabilities of road-crossings of GPS-marked female moose (Alces alces) (n = 102), and compared them with spatiotemporal patterns of police recorded moose-vehicle collisions (n = 1158). Probability of moose road-crossings peaked in May, June, and between mid November and the beginning of January, i.e. during moose migration. Moose-vehicle collisions were more likely during autumn and winter. Comparing environmental attributes of crossing and collision sites showed significant differences. The likelihood of collisions increased with the abundance of human-modified areas and higher allowed speed, and was lower on forest roads. We found that animal movement data alone are insufficient to predict collision risk zones, while analyses of collision data alone overestimate the collision risk in certain habitats. Our findings suggest that higher collision risk is largely due to low light and poor road surface conditions rather than to more animal road-crossings. This suggests that efforts to reduce wildlife collisions should focus on driver attitudes and road conditions rather than animal movement, and any efforts to model the collision risk will require actual collision data, and not just movement data.

We also investigated some physical and biological mechanisms that may jointly explain such differences. The overall insect damage in H. latispatha was similar between road edges and natural forest gaps (8.0% vs. 7.2% of leaf area). Damage by caterpillars, however, decreased from 4.2 percent in forest gaps to 0.5 percent on road edges, whereas damage by leaf-cutting ants increased from 0 to 5.8 percent. In secondary riparian vegetation, where none of the leaves sampled were attacked by ants, overall herbivore damage in H. collinsiana was less than half that observed in forest gaps (3.0% vs. 6.7%), and driven mainly by differences in caterpillar damage (2.5% vs. 6.2%). By contrast, attack by leaf fungal pathogens was two to three times greater in both human-disturbed habitats than in gaps (8.29.6% vs. 3.74.2%).

I hypothesized that microclimatic changes related to deforestation cause similar shifts for forest species persisting within degraded landscapes. This appears to be the first study to examine this novel hypothesis. I examined elevational distributions of dung beetle communities along parallel intact and disturbed elevational gradients from 290 to 3450 m asl in the Andes of southeastern Peru. Deforested sites were consistently warmer and drier than forested sites. To maintain the same ambient temperature as in forest, species in a deforested landscape would need to shift on average 489 +/- 59 m upslope. Dung beetle species showed a mean upslope range shift of 132 +/- 64 m (maximum=743 m) in the deforested landscape. Eight species occurred farther upslope in the degraded landscape, while none shifted downslope. In addition to upper range limit expansions, six species shifting upslope also showed range contractions or population declines at their lower range boundary. High elevation and disturbance-tolerant species did not show range shifts. These findings suggest that land-use change may both confound and compound the influence of global climate change on biodiversity. Synergies between habitat degradation and climate change could more than double previous range shift projections for this century, leading to unexpectedly rapid changes in biodiversity, especially for sensitive organisms such as tropical insects.

Conservation in spruce-dominated reserves is often contradicted by salvage logging after insect outbreaks. Here we study the community characteristics of wood decaying fungi in a high montane Norway Spruce forest with three different management types: (1) a formerly managed area disturbed by a large-scale bark beetle outbreak, (2) an area with continuous salvage logging, and (3) an old-growth forest. Bark beetle activity in the disturbed area resulted in downed wood amounts comparable to those of the old-growth forest. However, species accumulation curves for the disturbed forest were more similar to those of the logged forest than to those of the old-growth forest. This arose because of differences in the diversity of wood decay classes; wood decay in the disturbed forest was more homogeneous. Logs in the disturbed forest originated almost exclusively from bark-beetle-infested trees, but the causes of tree mortality in the old-growth forest were manifold. Although most red-listed species were clearly confined to old-growth forest, Antrodiella citrinella was most abundant in the disturbed forest. Our analysis furthermore showed that the between stand scale is the most effective unit for diversity wood-decaying fungi.

In this study, we explore the comparative impacts of fire and elephant on 2,522 individually identified large trees (5 m in height) in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Data were collected from 21 transects first surveyed in April 2006 and resurveyed in November 2008, to determine the relative importance of past damage by these agents on subsequent impacts and mortality. The occurrence of fire or elephant damage in 2006 affected the amount of tree volume subsequently removed by both these agents; elephant removed more tree volume from previously burned trees and the impact of subsequent fire was higher on previously burned or elephant-utilized trees than on undamaged trees. Mortality was also affected by an interaction between previous and recent damage, as the probability of mortality was highest for trees that suffered from fire or elephant utilization after being pushed over. Subsequent fire damage, but not elephant utilization, on debarked trees also increased the probability of mortality. Mortality was twice (4.6% per annum) that of trees progressing into the 5 m height class, suggesting an overall decline in large tree density during the 30-month study period.

We firstly review the different types of partial migration, and assess the ecological drivers responsible for driving individual differences in migratory tendency within populations. A variety of factors can be important in promoting the evolution of partial migration, including competition for resources or breeding opportunities, predation risk and intraspecific niche diversity. Often various factors act synergistically to create complex patterns of movement polymorphism within populations. The question of how partial migration is maintained over evolutionary timescales is also addressed. Whilst many theoretical considerations of partial migration utilise an evolutionary stable state (ESS) paradigm, empirical evidence for this is lacking. Rather the evidence suggests that partial migration is mostly condition dependent, and the optimum outcome for an individual is dependent upon its phenotype. What determines whether an individual follows a migratory or resident strategy is discussed in light of new theory and empirical data which supports the idea that environmentally responsive genetic thresholds are important across a range of species, from birds to fish, in proximately shaping migratory tendency.

Infected and uninfected populations of two P. caudatum genotypes were created and four constant temperature treatments (26 degrees C, 28 degrees C, 30 degrees C and 32 degrees C) compared with four variable treatments with the same mean temperatures. Variable temperature treatments were achieved by alternating populations between permissive (23 degrees C) and restrictive (35 degrees C) conditions daily over 30 days. Variable conditions and high temperatures caused greater declines in Paramecium populations, greater fluctuations in population size and higher incidence of extinction. The additional effect of parasite infection was additive and enhanced the negative effects of the variable environment and higher temperatures by up to 50 per cent. The variable environment and high temperatures also caused a decrease in parasite prevalence (up to 40%) and an increase in extinction (absence of detection) (up to 30%).

We developed a suite of statistical models (where we combined existing models with novel ones) to test for richness and evenness effects on detrital processing in freshwater microcosms. Instead of using consumer species as biodiversity units, we used two size classes within three species (six types). This allowed us to test for diversity effects and also to focus on the role of body size and biomass. 3. Our statistical models tested for (i) whether performance in polyculture was more than the sum of its parts (non-additive effects), (ii) the effects of specific type combinations (assemblage identity effects) and (iii) whether types behaved differently when their absolute or relative abundances were altered (e. g. because type abundance in polyculture was lower compared with monoculture). The latter point meant we did not need additional density treatments. 4. Process rates were independent of richness and evenness and all types performed in an additive fashion. The performance of a type was mainly driven by the consumers' metabolic requirements (connected to body size). On an assemblage level, biomass explained a large proportion of detrital processing rates. 5. We conclude that B-EF studies would benefit from widening their statistical approaches.

The ratio of bulls to cows was related to male harvest and hunter access, and thresholds were evident in predictor variables for all vital rate models. 4. Findings indicate that the contributions of density-dependent and independent factors can vary depending on the scale of population process. The importance of density dependence and habitat supply to low-density ungulate populations was evident, and management strategies for ungulates may be improved by explicitly linking forest management and harvest. Findings emphasize the importance of considering summer climatic influences to ungulate populations, as recruitment in moose was more sensitive to the timing of vegetation green-up than winter severity. The efficacy of management decisions for harvested ungulates may require regional shifts in targets where populations span bioclimatic gradients. The use of GAMs in combination with recursive partitioning was demonstrated to be an informative analytical framework that captured nonlinear relationships common in natural processes and thresholds that are relevant to population management in diverse systems.",15,2011,80,6,1288,1298,10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01875.x"Wischnewski, J; Kramer, A; Kong, ZC; Mackay, AW; Simpson, GL; Mischke, S; Herzschuh, U",Terrestrial and aquatic responses to climate change and human impact on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau during the past two centuries,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Article,climate change; compositional species turnover; diatoms; human impact; pollen; Procrustes rotation; Tibetan Plateau,"Rapid population growth and economic development have led to increased anthropogenic pressures on the Tibetan Plateau, causing significant land cover changes with potentially severe ecological consequences. To assess whether or not these pressures are also affecting the remote montane-boreal lakes on the SE Tibetan Plateau, fossil pollen and diatom data from two lakes were synthesized. The interplay of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem response was explored in respect to climate variability and human activity over the past 200 years. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling and Procrustes rotation analysis were undertaken to determine whether pollen and diatom responses in each lake were similar and synchronous. Detrended canonical correspondence analysis was used to develop quantitative estimates of compositional species turnover. Despite instrumental evidence of significant climatic warming on the southeastern Plateau, the pollen and diatom records indicate very stable species composition throughout their profiles and show only very subtle responses to environmental changes over the past 200 years. The compositional species turnover (0.36-0.94 SD) is relatively low in comparison to the species reorganizations known from the periods during the mid-and early-Holocene (0.64-1.61 SD) on the SE Plateau, and also in comparison to turnover rates of sediment records from climate-sensitive regions in the circum arctic. Our results indicate that climatically induced ecological thresholds are not yet crossed, but that human activity has an increasing influence, particularly on the terrestrial ecosystem in our study area. Synergistic processes of post-Little Ice Age warming, 20th century climate warming and extensive reforestations since the 19th century have initiated a change from natural oak-pine forests to seminatural, likely less resilient pine-oak forests.

In addition, the diversity and stability of the intestinal microbial community were investigated over time, with different food sources as well as under starvation stress and death, and were compared to the community in the cultivation water. The diversity of the Daphnia gut microbiota was low. The bacterial community consisted mainly of Betaproteobacteria (e.g. Limnohabitans sp.), few Gammaproteobacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas sp.) and Bacteroidetes that were related to facultatively anaerobic bacteria, but did not contain typical fermentative or obligately anaerobic gut bacteria. Rather, the microbiota was constantly dominated by Limnohabitans sp. which belongs to the Lhab-A1 tribe (previously called R-BT065 cluster) that is abundant in various freshwaters. Other bacterial groups varied distinctly even under constant cultivation conditions. Overall, the intestinal microbial community did not reflect the community in the surrounding cultivation water and clustered separately when analysed via the Additive Main Effects and Multiplicative Interaction model. In addition, the microbiota proved to be stable also when Daphnia were exposed to bacteria associated with a different food alga. After starvation, the community in the digestive tract was reduced to stable members. After death of the host animals, the community composition in the gut changed distinctly, and formerly undetected bacteria were activated. Our results suggest that the Daphnia microbiota consists mainly of an aerobic resident bacterial community which is indigenous to this habitat.",15,2011,62,4,882,894,10.1007/s00248-011-9886-8"Staehr, PA; Borum, J",Seasonal acclimation in metabolism reduces light requirements of eelgrass (Zostera marina),JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,Article,Depth limit; Light requirement; Photosynthesis; Respiration; Temperature acclimation; Zostera marina,"We investigated the ability of eelgrass (Zostera marina) to adjust light requirements to seasonal changes in temperature, light and nutrient conditions through changes in metabolism, pigment and nutrient content. In agreement with expectations we found that rates of respiration and light saturated photosynthesis of summer acclimated plants peaked at higher temperatures (5 degrees C and 2 degrees C higher, respectively), and were lower than of winter acclimated plants, both at sub- and supra-optimal temperatures. Moreover respiration rates were generally more sensitive to increasing temperatures than photosynthetic rates, especially so for cold acclimated plants in February (36% higher Q(10)-values). These changes were accompanied by a reduction in chlorophyll a and nitrogen concentrations in leaves by 35% and 60% respectively from February to August. The critical light requirement (E(C)) of Z. marina to maintain a positive carbon balance increased exponentially with increasing temperature but less so for summer-acclimated than for winter-acclimated plants. However, combining E(C) vs temperature models for whole-plants with data on daily light availability showed that seasonal acclimation in metabolism increased the annual period, when light requirements were meet at the 2-5 m depth interval, by 32-66 days. Hence, acclimation is an important mechanism allowing eelgrass to grow faster and penetrate to deeper waters. Critical depth limits estimated for different combinations of summer temperatures and water clarity in a future climate scenario, suggested that expected increases in temperature and nutrient run-off have synergistic negative effects, especially in clear waters, stressing the importance of continued efforts to improve water clarity of coastal waters.

Population bottlenecks, although less effective, may have similar consequences. We tested this hypothesis in the self-fertile freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis, by subjecting experimental populations to a single bottleneck of varied magnitude. Although patterns were not strong, heterosis was significant in the most severely bottlenecked populations, under stressful conditions. This was mainly due to hatching rate, suggesting that early acting and highly deleterious alleles were involved. Although L. stagnalis is a preferential outcrosser, inbreeding depression was very low and showed no clear relationship with bottleneck size. In the less reduced populations, inbreeding depression for hatching success increased under high inbreeding.

At the same time, increasing fisheries exploitation is impacting on marine ecosystems. Here, using increased benthic-invertebrate mortality as a proxy for effects of ocean acidification, the potential impact of the two stressors of fishing and acidification on the southeast Australian marine ecosystem to year 2050 was explored. The individual and interaction effects of the two stressors on biomass and diversity were examined for the entire ecosystem and for regional assemblages. For 61 functional groups or species, the cumulative effects of moderate ocean acidification and fishing were additive (30%), synergistic (33%), and antagonistic (37%). Strong ocean acidification resulted in additive (22%), synergistic (40%), and antagonistic (38%) effects. The greatest impact was on the demersal food web, with fishing impacting predation and acidification affecting benthic production. Areas that have been subject to intensive fishing were the most susceptible to acidification effect, although fishing also mitigated some of the decline in biodiversity observed with moderate acidification. The model suggested that ocean acidification and long-term fisheries exploitation could act synergistically with the increasing sensitivity to change from long-term (decades) fisheries exploitation potentially causing unexpected restructuring of the pelagic and demersal food webs. Major regime shifts occur around year 2040.

Further, input of propagules of alien plant species associated to touristic exploitation and development is intense. This has contributed to establishment and spread of aliens in coastal systems. Records of alien species in databases of such heterogeneous landscapes remain scarce, posing a challenge for statistical modelling. We address this issue and attempt to shed light on the role of environmental stress/disturbance gradients and propagule pressure on invasibility of plant communities in these typical model systems. Location: Sandy coasts of Lazio (Central Italy). Methods: We proposed an innovative methodology to deal with low prevalence of alien occurrence in a data set and high cost of field-based sampling by taking advantage, through predictive modelling, of the strong interrelation between vegetation and abiotic features in coastal dunes. We fitted generalized additive models to analyse (1) overall patterns of alien occurrence and spread and (2) specific patterns of the most common alien species recorded. Conclusion: Even in the presence of strong propagule pressure, variation in local abiotic conditions can explain differences in invasibility within a local environment, and intermediate levels of natural disturbance and stress offer the best conditions for spread of alien species. However, in our model system, propagule pressure is actually the main determinant of alien species occurrence and spread. We demonstrated that extending the information of environmental features measured in a subsample of vegetation plots through predictive modelling allows complex questions in invasion biology to be addressed without requiring disproportionate funding and sampling effort.",28,2011,22,5,751,765,10.1111/j.1654-1103.2011.01303.x"Casini, M; Kornilovs, G; Cardinale, M; Mollmann, C; Grygiel, W; Jonsson, P; Raid, T; Flinkman, J; Feldman, V",Spatial and temporal density dependence regulates the condition of central Baltic Sea clupeids: compelling evidence using an extensive international acoustic survey,POPULATION ECOLOGY,Article,Body size; Herring Clupea harengus; Hydro-climate; Population density; Spatio-temporal changes; Sprat Sprattus sprattus,"For the first time an international acoustic survey dataset covering three decades was used to investigate the factors shaping the spatial and temporal patterns in the condition of sprat and herring in the Baltic Proper. Generalized additive models showed that the spatial and temporal fluctuations in sprat density have been the main drivers of the spatio-temporal changes of both sprat and herring condition, evidencing intra- and inter-specific density dependence mediated by the size and distribution of the sprat population. Salinity was also an important predictor of herring condition, whereas temperature explained only a minor part of sprat model deviance. Herring density was an additional albeit weak significant predictor for herring condition, evidencing also intra-specific density dependence within the herring population. For both species, condition was high and similar in all areas of the Baltic Proper until the early 1990s, coincident with low sprat densities. Afterwards, a drop in condition occurred and a clear south-north pattern emerged. The drop in condition after the early 1990s was stronger in the northern areas, where sprat population increased the most. We suggest that the increase in sprat density in the northern areas, and the consequent spatial differentiation in clupeid condition, have been triggered by the almost total disappearance of the predator cod from the northern Baltic Proper. This study provides a step forward in understanding clupeid condition in the Baltic Sea, presenting evidence that density-dependent mechanisms also operate at the spatial scale within stock units.

Despite their natural prominence in reef-building corals and widespread use in biotechnology, their biological role remains obscure. Here, we experimented with larvae of Acropora millepora to determine what can be learned about a coral larva or recruit from its fluorescent colour. We performed 12 crosses between seven A. millepora colonies representing differing fluorescence phenotypes, the larvae of which were exposed to a natural settlement cue (crustose coralline algae) and heat-light stress. Parental effects explained 18 per cent of variation in colour and 47 per cent of variation in settlement. The colour of the larval family emerged as a predictor of the settlement success: redder families were significantly less responsive to the provided settlement cue (p 0.006). This relationship was owing to a correlation between parental effects on settlement and colour (r 2 0.587, p 0.045). We also observed pronounced (16%) decline in settlement rate, as well as subtle (2%), but a statistically significant decrease in red fluorescence, as a consequence of heat-light stress exposure. Variation in settlement propensity in A. millepora is largely owing to additive genetic effects, and is thought to reflect variation in dispersal potential.

Amphibians have existed on the earth for over 300 million years, yet in just the last two decades there have been an alarming number of extinctions, nearly 168 species are believed to have gone extinct and at least 2,469 (43%) more have populations that are declining. Infectious diseases have been recognized as one major cause of worldwide amphibian population declines. This could be the result of the appearance of novel pathogens, or it could be that exposure to environmental stressors is increasing the susceptibility of amphibians to opportunistic pathogens.

I will present a series of case studies that illustrate the role of stress in disease outbreaks that have resulted in amphibian declines.

We used different spatial regression techniques to evaluate processes determining the invasion of the red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii. We evaluated four a priori hypotheses on processes that may determine crayfish invasion: landscape alteration, connectivity, wetland suitability for abiotic and biotic features. We assessed the distribution of P. clarkii in 119 waterbodies in a recently invaded area. We used spatially explicit statistical techniques (spatial eigen-vector mapping, generalized additive models, Bayesian intrinsic conditional autoregressive models) within an information-theoretic framework to assess the support of hypotheses; we also analyzed the pattern of spatial autocorrelation of data, model residuals, and eigenvectors. We found strong agreement between the results of spatial eigenvector mapping and Bayesian autoregressive models. Procambarus clarkii was significantly associated with the largest, permanent wetlands. Additive models suggested also association with human-dominated landscapes, but tended to overfit data. The results indicate that abiotic wetlands features and landscape alteration are major drivers of the species' distribution. Species distribution data, residuals of ordinary least squares regression, and spatial eigenvectors all showed positive and significant spatial autocorrelation at distances up to 2,500 m; this may be caused by the dispersal ability of the species.

Although both processes operate over similar spatial and temporal scales and are likely strongly coupled in many dryland systems, aeolian and fluvial processes have traditionally been studied separately, making it difficult to assess their relative importance in drylands, as well as their potential for synergistic interaction. Land degradation by accelerated wind and water erosion is a major problem throughout the world's drylands, and although recent studies suggest that these processes likely interact across broad spatial and temporal scales to amplify the transport of soil resources from and within drylands, many researchers and land managers continue to view them as separate and unrelated processes. Here, we illustrate how aeolian and fluvial sediment transport is coupled at multiple spatial and temporal scales and highlight the need for these interrelated processes to be studied from a more integrated perspective that crosses traditional disciplinary boundaries. Special attention is given to how the growing threat of climate change and land-use disturbance will influence linkages between aeolian and fluvial processes in the future. We also present emerging directions for interdisciplinary needs within the aeolian and fluvial research communities that call for better integration across a broad range of traditional disciplines such as ecology, biogeochemistry, agronomy, and soil conservation.

We illustrate the application of Before-During-After and Before-During-After-Control-Impact designs (BOA and BDACI) to assess effects of highway construction and operation using a population of great bustards (Otis tarda) as a model. Based on a time series of demographic and distribution data (1997-2009), we developed generalized additive models and classification trees to test the effect of road distance on bustard distribution, identify road-effect distances and explore the seasonality of these effects. Two control zones were selected to test the changes between construction phases on productivity, and population trends using TRIM models. From the start of the road construction, great bustards tended to avoid close proximity to the highway (ca. 560-750 m threshold distance). The exclusion band was narrower during the breeding season. In addition, family groups were less tolerant to highway operation disturbances, as shown by their higher distance effect (ca. 1300 m). Population trends did not differ between impact and control zones during the construction. However, once the highway was in operation, bustard numbers declined gradually up to 50% in the impact zone, remained stable in the closest control zone, and increased in the zone located at the greatest distance from the highway. The effects on density of family groups were less evident. Our approach provides information relevant to great bustard conservation and suggests methods for obtaining information of interest to road managers, that could be applied to linear infrastructures with others species.

Invasive zooplankton species did not become established in this estuary until the 1970s when increasing propagule pressure from Asia coincided with extended drought periods. Hydrological management exacerbated the effects of post-1960 droughts and reduced freshwater inflow even further, increasing drought severity and allowing unusually extreme salinity intrusions.

Populations inhabiting highly polluted aquatic habitats marginally showed higher activity level than the populations from less polluted environments, especially when larvae were exposed to ammonium or when nitrite appeared in combination with other nitrogen forms.

Previous research has shown interactions between hypoxia and some PAHs (fluoranthene, alpha-naphthoflavone) but no interaction with others (benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), beta-naphthoflavone). Here we examine how hypoxia (7.4% oxygen, similar to 35% of normoxia) affects the embryotoxicity of PAHs that act through different mechanisms and the role that CYP1A inhibition may play in these interactions. About 500 mu g/l BaP and 1-200 mu g/l benzo[k]fluoranthene (BkF) interacted synergistically with hypoxia to induce pericardial edema in developing zebrafish (Danio rerio). Hypoxia protected from the embryotoxicity of pyrene (PY) and had no effect on the toxicity of polychlorinated biphenyl-126. Despite previous reports of other CYP1A inhibitors interacting with hypoxia, up to 2,000 mu g/l dibenzothiophene, 2-aminoanthracene (AA), and carbazole (CB) all failed to induce embryotoxicity under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. The toxicity of PAH mixtures-including binary mixtures of BaP/AA and BaP/CB and two environmentally relevant, complex mixtures-were exacerbated severely by hypoxia to induce or worsen pericardial edema and cause mortality.

What are the species-specific habitat requirements? Are predictions in accordance with expert knowledge? Location: Bavarian Alps (Southern Germany). Methods: To describe tree species-environment relationships, we established species distribution models for the 14 most common tree species of the region. We combined tree species occurrence data from forest inventories and a vegetation database with environmental data from a digital elevation model, climate maps and soil maps. For modelling, we used generalized additive models (GAM) combined with techniques to account for spatial autocorrelation and uneven coverage of environmental gradients. We developed parsimonious models to judge whether statistical models correspond to models based on expert knowledge. Results: Conceptual models were generally in accordance with expectations. Variables based on average temperatures were the most important predictors in most models. Proxies for soil properties such as water and nutrient availability were statistically significant and generally plausible, but appeared largely redundant for model performance. Altitudinal limits of tree species were generally well represented by models. Most species responded differently to summer and January temperatures, indicating that temperature variables are proxies not only for energy balance, but also for frost damage and drought. Although model building benefits considerably from collation with expert knowledge, there are limitations. Conclusions: Meaningful species distribution models can be obtained from noisy data sets covering only a small fraction of species ranges. Models calibrated with such data sets benefit from hypothesis-driven model building rather than strict data-driven model building. Hence, misleading explanations and predictions can be avoided and uncertainties identified. Nevertheless, projections based on climate scenarios can be substantially improved only with models calibrated on a wider data set. Ideally, environmental gradients should cover the whole niche space of a species, or at least include regions with analogous climate.",17,2011,22,4,635,646,10.1111/j.1654-1103.2011.01274.x"Massot, M; Clobert, J; Montes-Poloni, L; Haussy, C; Cubo, J; Meylan, S",An integrative study of ageing in a wild population of common lizards,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,Article,corticosterone; fitness; immunity; maturation; metabolic rate; reptile; senescence; terminal investment,"1. Integrative studies on ageing patterns in multiple traits of organisms are challenging and rare in free-living populations. However, developing integrative approaches could prove useful to understanding ageing patterns as causes of age variations are diverse, with conflicting or related actions. Accordingly, we investigated age variation of multiple aspects in the common lizard Lacerta (Zootoca) vivipara. 2. In a wild population of common lizards, we studied five fitness components, three physiological traits (cell-mediated immunity, corticosterone level, resting metabolic rate), and controlled for individual and environmental heterogeneities. To quantify ageing patterns in fitness, we used individual-based data collected over 14 years (18 684 captures, 892 reproductive events). 3. Ageing patterns were found in multiple aspects. They provided evidence for female maturation early in adulthood (access to reproduction, litter size), followed by senescence in female reproduction (litter success) and survival. In parallel to senescence, a pattern of terminal investment enhanced offspring quality (offspring body size, offspring corpulence, litter success). Ageing patterns involved physiology with higher metabolic rate and T cell-mediated immune response in old females. 4. Several ageing patterns were dependent on environmental and individual characteristics (habitat, year, sex, body size). Interestingly, senescence occurred only in females with a high reproductive effort early in life. Rarely showed, this trade-off between early and late-life performances is expected under the antagonistic pleiotropy and disposable soma theories of senescence. 5.

These systems are thought to be very sensitive to threats from climate change, and land-use modification including artificial drainage, overgrazing, afforestation and vegetation burning. This study examined ten peatland streams in the headwaters of the River Tees to examine spatial and seasonal patterns of instream physicochemical variables and benthic macroinvertebrate communities across the stream network. Principle component analysis revealed significant positive relationships between catchment size and electrical conductivity, sulfate concentration, pH and median bed sediment size, and negative relationships with suspended sediment and aluminium concentrations. Seasonal variability was particularly evident in stream water temperature, benthic particulate organic matter and nitrate and chloride concentrations. Macroinvertebrate community abundance and diversity were typically similar across streams, but redundancy analysis demonstrated turnover of macroinvertebrate assemblages with increases in stream size. In particular, first-and second-order streams hosted small-sized stoneflies such as Amphinemura standfussi and Nemoura cambrica, while larger streams (third-and fourth-order) supported more mayflies and larger predatory stoneflies (e. g. Dinocras cephalotes and Perla bipunctata).

Population dynamics of small pelagic fish may therefore be regulated neither strictly bottom-up nor top-down, but rather through multiple external and internal drivers. While in many studies single drivers have been identified, potential synergies of multiple factors, as well as their relative importance in regulating population dynamics of small pelagic fish, is a largely unresolved issue. Using a statistical, age-structured modeling approach, we demonstrate the relative importance and influence of bottom-up (e.g., climate, zooplankton availability) and top-down (i.e., fishing and predation) factors on the population dynamics of Bothnian Sea herring (Clupea harengus) throughout its life cycle. Our results indicate significant bottom-up effects of zooplankton and interspecific competition from sprat (Sprattus sprattus), particularly on younger age classes of herring. Although top-down forcing through fishing and predation by grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) also was evident, these factors were less important than resource availability and interspecific competition.

Given their demonstrated resistance to environmental stress, it might be expected that the role of sponges in reef systems under modern regimes of frequent and severe disturbance may become even more substantial. Disturbances have recently reshaped the community structure of many Caribbean coral reefs shifting them towards a state of persistent low coral cover and often a dominance of macroalgae. Using competition and growth rates recorded from Glover's Atoll in Belize, we parameterise a mathematical model used to simulate the three-way competition between sponges, macroalgae and coral. We use the model to determine the range of parameters in which each of the three species might be expected to dominate. Emergent properties arise from our simple model of this complex system, and these include a special case in which heightened competitive ability of macroalgae versus coral may counter-intuitively prove to be advantageous to the persistence of corals. Importantly, we show that even under scenarios whereby sponges fail to invade the system, inclusion of this third antagonist can qualitatively affect the likelihood of alternative stable states - generally in favour of macroalgal dominance. The interplay between multi-species competition and predation is complex, but our efforts highlight a key process that has, until now, remained unexplored: the extent to which sponges dissipate algal grazing pressure by providing generalist fish with an alternative food source. We highlight the necessity of identifying the extent by which this process takes place in tropical systems in order to improve projections of alternative stable states for Caribbean coral reefs.

There is a pressing need for robust predictions of potential futures of coral reef and associated human systems under alternative management scenarios. Understanding and predicting the dynamics of coral reef systems at regional scales of tens to hundreds of kilometers is imperative, because reef systems are connected by physical and socioeconomic processes across regions and often across international boundaries. We present a spatially explicit regional-scale model of ecological dynamics for a general coral reef system. In designing our model as a tool for decision support, we gave precedence to portability and accessibility; the model can be parameterized for dissimilar coral reef systems in different parts of the world, and the model components and outputs are understandable for nonexperts. The model simulates local-scale dynamics, which are coupled across regions through larval connectivity between reefs. We validate our model using an instantiation for the Meso-American Reef system. The model realistically captures local and regional ecological dynamics and responds to external forcings in the form of harvesting, pollution, and physical damage (e.g., hurricanes, coral bleaching) to produce trajectories that largely fall within limits observed in the real system. Moreover, the model demonstrates behaviors that have relevance for management considerations. In particular, differences in larval supply between reef localities drive spatial variability in modeled reef community structure. Reef tracts for which recruitment is low are more vulnerable to natural disturbance and synergistic effects of anthropogenic stressors.

It is essential that this variation be understood if trends in diversity are to be predicted with any degree of confidence under a scenario of global change. Here we examine patterns of butterfly species richness among groups differing in degree of habitat specialization, diet breadth and mobility in the north-west Mediterranean Basin, a European hotspot for this taxon. We analyze a large number of butterfly communities and take into consideration the main potential drivers, that include climatic, geographic and resource variables, landscape structure and human environmental impact at different spatial scales. Our study shows that both climatic and anthropogenic factors play an important role in determining butterfly species richness in the north-west Mediterranean Basin, but that their relative impact differs between specialist and generalist groups. At lower altitudes, water availability, a product of the interplay between temperature and rainfall, and negative effects of temperature appear as the most determinant factors. Maximum diversity was observed at mid-altitudes, which reveals the importance from a conservation point of view of Mediterranean mountain ranges. The results suggest serious population declines in specialist species restricted to mountain areas as a result of climate warming in combination with habitat loss caused by the abandonment of grazing and mowing. They also suggest negative trends for generalist species due to an increase in aridity in combination with an increase in intensification of human land use in lowland areas. Such synergies are expected to lead to rapid declines in Mediterranean butterfly populations in the coming years, thereby posing a severe threat for the conservation of European biodiversity.",33,2011,34,3,353,363,10.1111/j.1600-0587.2010.06264.x"Tscharntke, T; Clough, Y; Bhagwat, SA; Buchori, D; Faust, H; Hertel, D; Holscher, D; Juhrbandt, J; Kessler, M; Perfecto, I; Scherber, C; Schroth, G; Veldkamp, E; Wanger, TC",Multifunctional shade-tree management in tropical agroforestry landscapes - a review,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,Review,agricultural intensification; Arabica and Robusta coffee; boom-and-bust cycles; cacao yield; ecological-economic trade-offs; ecological resilience; functional biodiversity; household vulnerability,"P>1. Agricultural intensification reduces ecological resilience of land-use systems, whereas paradoxically, environmental change and climate extremes require a higher response capacity than ever. Adaptation strategies to environmental change include maintenance of shade trees in tropical agroforestry, but conversion of shaded to unshaded systems is common practice to increase short-term yield. 2. In this paper, we review the short-term and long-term ecological benefits of shade trees in coffee Coffea arabica, C. canephora and cacao Theobroma cacao agroforestry and emphasize the poorly understood, multifunctional role of shade trees for farmers and conservation alike. 3. Both coffee and cacao are tropical understorey plants. Shade trees in agroforestry enhance functional biodiversity, carbon sequestration, soil fertility, drought resistance as well as weed and biological pest control. However, shade is needed for young cacao trees only and is less important in older cacao plantations. This changing response to shade regime with cacao plantation age often results in a transient role for shade and associated biodiversity in agroforestry. 4. Abandonment of old, unshaded cacao in favour of planting young cacao in new, thinned forest sites can be named 'short-term cacao boom-and-bust cycle', which counteracts tropical forest conservation. In a 'long-term cacao boom-and-bust cycle', cacao boom can be followed by cacao bust due to unmanageable pest and pathogen levels (e.g. in Brazil and Malaysia). Higher pest densities can result from physiological stress in unshaded cacao and from the larger cacao area planted. Risk-averse farmers avoid long-term vulnerability of their agroforestry systems by keeping shade as an insurance against insect pest outbreaks, whereas yield-maximizing farmers reduce shade and aim at short-term monetary benefits. 5. Synthesis and applications. Sustainable agroforestry management needs to conserve or create a diverse layer of multi-purpose shade trees that can be pruned rather than removed when crops mature. Incentives from payment-for-ecosystem services and certification schemes encourage farmers to keep high to medium shade tree cover. Reducing pesticide spraying protects functional agrobiodiversity such as antagonists of pests and diseases, pollinating midges determining cacao yields and pollinating bees enhancing coffee yield. In a landscape perspective, natural forest alongside agroforestry allows noncrop-crop spillover of a diversity of functionally important organisms. Knowledge transfer between farmers, agronomists and ecologists in a participatory approach helps to encourage a shade management regime that balances economic and ecological needs and provides a 'diversified food-and-cash crop' livelihood strategy.",78,2011,48,3,619,629,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01939.x"Trekels, H; Van de Meutter, F; Stoks, R",Effects of species-specific interactions with predation risk on the relative species sensitivities to a pesticide in water boatmen (Corixidae),OIKOS,Article,,"There is increasing concern that synergistic interactions between stressors may result in accelerated biodiversity loss. Yet, the prevalence and magnitude of these interactions remain one of the largest uncertainties in projections of future ecological change. Synergistic interactions between pesticide stress and predation risk are receiving increasing attention because they indicate that standard pesticide tests in the absence of predation risk may underestimate effects that occur under natural conditions. We questioned whether synergisms (or interactions in general), by differently shaping individual species' sensitivities, can modulate species sensitivity rankings (SSRs) in survival and growth rate. Using laboratory and outdoor mesocosm experiments with five species of water boatmen (Hemiptera: Corixidae) we studied mortality and growth rate over seven days of exposure. We evaluated the presence and nature of interactions between the pesticide endosulfan and predation risk and tested to what extent this affected the SSRs to endosulfan. The combined exposure to the pesticide and predation risk resulted in synergistic effects for survival (Sigara lateralis) and growth rate (Sigara iactans) and in an antagonistic effect for growth rate (Hesperocorixa linnaei and female Sigara striata). These results suggest that standard tests may underestimate the pesticide effect in a natural predator environment for some species. While the effects of these interactions on SSRs were not strong and SSRs remained largely similar in the absence and presence of predation risk, some obvious species rank shifts occurred for growth rate which may potentially affect community structure through changed competitive strength. The study of SSRs and their dependency on biotic stressors may provide a simple conceptual and predictive framework to increase our understanding of how stressors like pesticides may differentially affect community structure in the absence and presence of another stressor.",7,2011,120,6,897,905,10.1111/j.1600-0706.2010.18852.x"Wang, Z; Xiao, BD; Song, LR; Wu, XQ; Zhang, JQ; Wang, CB","Effects of microcystin-LR, linear alkylbenzene sulfonate and their mixture on lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) seeds and seedlings",ECOTOXICOLOGY,Article,Cyanotoxin; Anionic surfactant; Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.); Combined toxicity; Antioxidant defense system; Health risks,"Microcystin-LR (MCLR) and linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) are present widely in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, but their combined ecotoxicological risk is unknown.

The changes in seed germination and shoot/root growth, responses of the antioxidative defense system, and the accumulation of MCLR in lettuce were tested to evaluate the single and combined toxic effect of MCLR and LAS in well-controlled conditions. The results showed that seedling growth (except for root elongation and leaf weight) was more sensitive to toxicant exposure than seed germination. For seedling leaves, lipid peroxidation was not observed when the antioxidative defense system (including superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione) was activated to relieve the adverse effects of oxidative stress via different pathways. Our results also confirmed that the interaction between MCLR and LAS was synergistic. Both toxicants in combination not only significantly inhibited seedling growth, but also increased the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase, as well as the contents of glutathione.

This is particularly true for the open oceans, where few protected areas currently exist and data availability is limited. Here, we examine the relationship between the distributions of tuna and billfish species richness (an indicator of pelagic biodiversity), the human impact drivers of fishing pressure (quantified as cumulative removals) and sea surface temperature increase (quantified as the increase in large positive anomalies) in tropical to temperate oceans at the scale of a 5 degrees x 5 degrees grid. We investigate relationships using Generalised Additive Models and Regression Tree analysis, and identify the top 50 ""hotspot"" cells for species richness and each of the two impact drivers. We find that both impact drivers significantly overlap with high species richness, but relationships are complex, non-linear and ocean-basin specific. Higher fishing pressure is associated with higher species richness in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and this overlap is particularly prominent in the central Pacific, and in the Indian Ocean around Sri Lanka. In the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, species richness is generally higher in areas that have seen lower levels of change in sea surface temperature and only one cell, near Easter Island, is a hotspot for species richness and sea surface temperature increase. While species richness and impact drivers overlap in some areas, there are many areas with high species richness and limited apparent impact.

We surveyed herbaceous plant communities (of a height < 1.5 m) in 84 hedgerows in the Seine river floodplain of France. Two types of potential drivers for species richness, accounting for landscape mosaic and hedgerow network, were recorded at both hedgerow and site scale. The distribution of species richness through the components of alpha hedgerow diversity (i.e. the average diversity within a habitat) and gamma hedgerow diversity (i.e. the total diversity across habitats) were assessed using additive partitioning methods, while the relationship between species diversity and its potential landscape drivers at both scales was modeled using Generalized Additive Models. Our results indicated that gamma hedgerow diversity is explained by the heterogeneity of the landscape structure, which is correlated with the mosaic of agricultural land use. At this scale, intrinsic properties of the configuration of the hedgerow networks have a weak influence on species richness. Alpha hedgerow diversity is also explained by landscape variables, accounting for both the configuration of agricultural mosaics and hedgerow networks, but to a lesser extent. Time lags for species responses are shown at both scales, and for the two types of drivers. Extinction or colonization debt may be indicated at both scales, while the remnant effects of former practices may also be responsible for such patterns at a local scale. We suggest that hedgerow management should take the specific parameters of both scales into account.

We investigated the abundance of gray-headed lemurs (Eulemur cinereiceps) and vegetation structure in the fragmented forest of Manombo from 1995 to 2007, including 10 yr following Cyclone Gretelle in January 1997. We predicted that the density of this arboreal, frugivorous lemur would be similar in the pre- and post-cyclone intervals only if tree measures demonstrate trends toward recovery in the post-cyclone period. Initial impacts included severe damage to over 60 percent of trees. After 10 yr, all vegetation metrics except for stem density remained low relative to the pre-cyclone period, including dbh, height, and basal area. To investigate vegetation changes separately from cyclone effects, we compared forest structure in the pre-cyclone period alone. Basal area declined but dbh and stem density did not vary between 1995 and 1997; thus, anthropogenic activities or other factors did not consistently alter forest structure in this 2-yr period. Subsequent changes may be linked to cyclone response, presumably in synergy with human disturbance. Contrary to predictions, recent gray-headed lemur population densities were nearly identical to those recorded in 1995 (13.5 +/- 3.2 vs. 13.6 +/- 6.4 individuals/km2, respectively). Lemur populations may have remained stable or declined initially and then recovered in the last 10 yr.

Individuals selected for carbaryl resistance had higher survival rates when exposed to the pesticide but also a greater susceptibility to the challenge imposed by the bacterial endoparasite Pasteuria ramosa. The evolved resistance to carbaryl was in some cases only expressed in the absence of fish kairomones.

This field experiment included four treatments-CO2, temperature, precipitation, nitrogen-with two levels per treatment (ambient and elevated), and all their factorial combinations replicated six times. We collected soil samples after 7 and 8 years of treatments, and measured gross rates of N mineralization, N immobilization and nitrification, along with potential rates of ammonia oxidation, nitrite oxidation and denitrification. We also determined the main drivers of these microbial activities (soil ammonium and nitrate concentrations, soil moisture, soil temperature, soil pH, and soil CO2 efflux, as an indicator of soil heterotrophic activity). We found that gross N mineralization responded to the interactive effects of the CO2, precipitation and N treatments: N addition increased gross N mineralization when CO2 and precipitation were either both at ambient or both at elevated levels. However, we found limited evidence for interactions among elevated CO2, warming, increased precipitation, and enhanced N supply on the other N cycling processes examined: statistically significant interactions, when found, tended not to persist across multiple dates. Soil N cycling responded mainly to single-factor effects: long-term N addition increased gross N immobilization, potential ammonia oxidation and potential denitrification, while increased precipitation depressed potential nitrite oxidation and increased potential ammonia oxidation and potential denitrification. In contrast, elevated CO2 and modest warming did not significantly affect any of these microbial N transformations.

We exposed a seminatural Danish heathland ecosystem to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), warming, and extended summer drought in all combinations. Here, we report on the short-term responses of the nitrogen (N) cycle after 2 years of treatments. Elevated CO2 significantly affected aboveground stoichiometry by increasing the carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratios in the leaves of both co-dominant species (Calluna vulgaris and Deschampsia flexuosa), as well as the C/N ratios of Calluna flowers and by reducing the N concentration of Deschampsia litter. Belowground, elevated CO2 had only minor effects, whereas warming increased N turnover, as indicated by increased rates of microbial NH4+ consumption, gross mineralization, potential nitrification, denitrification and N2O emissions. Drought reduced belowground gross N mineralization and decreased fauna N mass and fauna N mineralization. Leaching was unaffected by treatments but was significantly higher across all treatments in the second year than in the much drier first year indicating that ecosystem N loss is highly sensitive to changes and variability in amount and timing of precipitation. Interactions between treatments were common and although some synergistic effects were observed, antagonism dominated the interactive responses in treatment combinations, i.e. responses were smaller in combinations than in single treatments. Nonetheless, increased C/N ratios of photosynthetic tissue in response to elevated CO2, as well as drought-induced decreases in litter N production and fauna N mineralization prevailed in the full treatment combination.

We review the observed impacts of climate change (e.g. warming, ocean acidification, changes in storm patterns) on subtidal temperate coasts in Australia and assess how these systems are likely to respond to further change. Observed impacts are region specific with the greatest number of species responses attributable to climate change reported in south-eastern Australia, where recent ocean warming has been most pronounced. Here, a decline of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) and poleward range extension of a key herbivore (sea urchin) and other trophically important reef organisms has occurred. Although, evidence of changes on other coastlines around Australia is limited, we suggest that this is due to a lack of data rather than lack of change. Because of the east-west orientation of the south coast, most of Australia's temperate waters are found within a narrow latitudinal band, where any southward movement of isotherms is likely to affect species across very large areas. Future increases in temperature are likely to result in further range shifts of macroalgae and associated species, with range contractions and local extinctions to be expected for species that have their northern limits along the southern coastline. While there is currently no evidence of changes attributable to non-temperature related climate impacts, potentially due to a lack of long-term observational data, experimental evidence suggests that ocean acidification will result in negative effects on calcifying algae and animals. More importantly, recent experiments suggest the combined effects of climate change and non-climate stressors (overharvesting, reduced water quality) will lower the resilience of temperate marine communities to perturbations (e.g. storms, diseases, and introduced species), many of which are also predicted to increase in frequency and/or severity. Thus climate change is likely to, both by itself and in synergy with other stressors, impose change to southern Australian coastal species, including important habitat-forming algae and the associated ecological functioning of temperate coasts. Management of local and regional-scale stresses may increase the resistance of temperate marine communities to climate stressors and as such, provides an attractive tool for building resilience in temperate systems.

To overcome problems and drawbacks in this type of indices, the ""relative volume of the pharyngeal lumen (RVPL)"" was first introduced in biological assessments in 2006 and it focused on the assumption that pollution is commonly expressed in terms of reduced food intake. This index, evaluated by using a morphometric approach, expresses the sucking potential of the pharynx. A series of microcosm experiments was performed in order to test the ""relative volume of the pharyngeal lumen (RVPL)"" as a biomonitoring index in the cases of 8 free-living nematode species (the deposit-feeders, Daptonema normandicum, Desmodora longiseta, and Leptonemella aphanothecae; the epistrate feeder, Xyala striata; the facultative predators. Oncholaimus campylocercoides and Oncholaimellus mediterraneus; and the predators Bathylaimus capacosus and Mesacanthion hirsutum). Each species was exposed to various concentrations of toxicants (nickel, copper, chromium and Diesel Fuel) used separately or in combinations. Our results showed that RVPL increased with increasing amount of toxicants, visibly caused by a systematic decrease in body volume with toxicants. Responses of all examined species suggested an additive toxicological action. Predators (M. hirsutum and B. capacosus) showed the highest potential of adaptation because of their higher means of RVPL Observations during this experiment highlight the importance of pharyngeal pumping and cuticular structure to tolerating elevated catabolic water loss under stress conditions. Thus the ability to osmoregulate is an important factor in overcoming food sedimentary toxicants. Based on all these findings, RVPL was found to be an accurate and precise index of monitoring the effect of metals and Diesel Fuel in marine ecosystems. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Although relatively few coral reef fishes are at risk of global extinction from climate disturbances, a negative convex relationship between fish species locally vulnerable to climate change vs. fisheries exploitation indicates that the entire community is vulnerable on the many reefs where both stressors co-occur.

Droughts occurred during two of the four years of the study, and we found that higher light levels were generally associated with decreased plant richness in drought years but increased plant richness in wet years. Most importantly, fertilization decreased richness whether light availability limited richness (wet years) or did not limit richness (drought years), and the effects of fertilization and light manipulation treatments were additive.

Lianas permeate most lowland tropical forests, where they can have a huge effect on tree diversity, recruitment, growth and survival, which, in turn, can alter tree community composition, carbon storage and carbon, nutrient and water fluxes. Consequently, increasing liana abundance and biomass have potentially profound ramifications for tropical forest composition and functioning. Currently, eight studies support the pattern of increasing liana abundance and biomass in American tropical and subtropical forests, whereas two studies, both from Africa, do not. The putative mechanisms to explain increasing lianas include increasing evapotranspirative demand, increasing forest disturbance and turnover, changes in land use and fragmentation and elevated atmospheric CO2. Each of these mechanisms probably contributes to the observed patterns of increasing liana abundance and biomass, and the mechanisms are likely to be interrelated and synergistic.

However, the conditions under which restoration of degraded tropical dry forests (TDF) might be achieved in practice have not been determined in detail. In this study, we used LANDIS-II, a spatially explicit model of forest dynamics, to assess the potential for passive restoration of TDF through natural regeneration. The model was applied to two Mexican landscapes under six different disturbance regimes, focusing on the impact of fire and cattle grazing on forest cover, structure and composition. Model results identified two main findings. First, tropical dry forests are more resilient to anthropogenic disturbance than expected. Results suggested that under both a scenario of small, infrequent fires and a scenario of large, frequent fires, forest area can increase relatively rapidly. However, forest structure and composition differed markedly between these scenarios. After 400 years, the landscape becomes increasingly occupied by relatively shade-tolerant species under small, infrequent fires, but only species with both relatively high shade tolerance and high fire tolerance can thrive under conditions with large, frequent fires. Second, we demonstrated that different forms of disturbance can interact in unexpected ways. Our projections revealed that when grazing acts in combination with fire, forest cover, structure and composition vary dramatically depending on the frequency and extent of the fires. Results indicated that grazing and fire have a synergistic effect causing a reduction in forest cover greater than the sum of their individual effects. This suggests that passive landscape-scale restoration of TDF is achievable in both Mexican study areas only if grazing is reduced, and fires are carefully managed to reduce their frequency and intensity.

Centuries of positive interspecies interactions may enhance the reproductive and survival success of garden species selected and encouraged by experienced Maya forest gardeners. We hypothesized that such interaction may result in aggregated spatial patterns between 32 pre-selected, commonly utilized forest garden species. In this paper, we developed a novel randomization (Monte Carlo) method designed to measure and test if the spatial relationships among pairs of Maya 'forest garden' trees species differ between areas that experienced high and low ancient settlement density in northwestern Belize. A total of 28 high ancient settlement density and 27 low ancient settlement density plots containing a total of 2772 and 3134 trees, respectively, were used for this study. The analysis revealed that 58 pairs of forest garden species tended to 'cluster' together significantly more often in the high settlement density areas than would be expected in a random distribution. In low settlement density plots, only 12 pairs of species exhibited a significant clustered spatial relationship. The effect was not species specific, suggesting that some synergistic relationships, mediated by third-party agents such as dispersers, may occur at the community level.

We examined changes in abundance, diversity and composition of anuran, lizard and snake assemblages along stream edge-upslope gradients in conserved and disturbed areas of tropical dry forest on the Pacific coast of Mexico. We sampled 659 plots in six watersheds over 2 yr. Two forest conditions (conserved and human disturbed, with three watersheds as replicates) were evaluated in the dry and rainy season. Within each watershed, plots were randomly located at three different distance categories from either stream edge: 0-10 m (near-stream environment), 30-40 m (mid-slope environment), and 50-60 m (upslope environment). Herpetofauna was surveyed by time-constrained searches with a sampling effort of 1980 person-hours. Eighteen anuran, 18 lizard and 23 snake species were recorded. Overall, abundance and diversity of lizards and snakes decreased from near-stream to upslope areas in both forest conditions and seasons; while that of anurans followed this trend only for the conserved forest during the rainy season. Regardless of distance, abundance and diversity of anurans markedly decreased during the dry season, while that of snakes and lizards increased.

Despite a rapidly growing body of work in this area, little attention has been paid to the importance of interspecific coevolutionary interactions. Antagonistic coevolution commonly observed between hosts and parasites is likely to retard evolutionary rescue because it often reduces population sizes, and results in the evolution of costly host defence and parasite counter-defence. We used experimental populations of a bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 and a bacteriophage virus (SBW25 Theta 2), to study how host-parasite coevolution impacts viral population persistence in the face of gradually increasing temperature, an environmental stress for the virus but not the bacterium. The virus persisted much longer when it evolved in the presence of an evolutionarily constant host genotype (i.e. in the absence of coevolution) than when the bacterium and virus coevolved. Further experiments suggest that both a reduction in population size and costly infectivity strategies contributed to viral extinction as a result of coevolution.

It has been recently proposed that fast growth leads to the accumulation of cellular damages due to oxidative stress, influencing subsequent performances and life span. Therefore, the trade-off between fast growth and oxidative stress may potentially function as an important constraint in the evolution of growth trajectories. We test this by examining a potential antagonistic pleiotropy between growth and blood resistance to controlled free radical attack in a wild bird using a cross-fostering design and robust quantitative genetic analyses. In the yellow-legged gull Larus michahellis, decreased resistance to oxidative stress at age 8 days was associated with faster growth in mass, across the first 8 days of life, suggesting a trade-off between mass growth and oxidative-stress-related somatic maintenance. We found a negative genetic correlation between chick growth and resistance to oxidative stress, supporting the presence of the genetic trade-off between the two traits. Therefore, investment of somatic resources in growth could be constrained by resistance to oxidative stress in phenotypic and genetic levels.

Species richness was lowest in salvage-logged stands, largely due to a negative effect of harvesting on the occurrence of wood- and bark-boring species. In comparison with undisturbed stands, the combination of wildfire and logging in salvage-logged stands had a greater effect on species composition than either disturbance alone. Strong differences in species composition among stand treatments were linked to differences in quantity and quality (e.g., decay stage) of coarse woody debris. We found that the effects of wildfire and logging on deadwood-associated beetles were synergistic, such that the effects of postfire salvage logging could not be predicted reliably on the basis of data on either disturbance alone.

Much of this relevance may depend on how animals cope with plant resources at different spatial scales. However, little is known about how and why different interactions perform at different scales in the same environmental setting. In this study we assess the spatial scales at which two plant-animal interactions operate and disentangle the environmental factors (plant resource availability vs. habitat structure) underpinning these operational scales. We studied two interactions with opposite (mutualistic vs. antagonistic) ecological effects on fleshy-fruited trees, frugivory and seed dispersal by birds, and the later predation by rodents on bird-dispersed seeds. Employing a standardized sampling, we covered three temperate ecosystems hosting structurally similar plant-frugivore-seed predator systems: Cantabrian forest, Mediterranean shrubland, and Patagonian forest. We sampled habitat structure (tree and understory covers), fleshy-fruit abundance, bird-dispersed seed occurrence, frugivorous bird abundance, and seed predation rate, along 15002500 m transects. Using a spatially explicit approach, we broke down the predictable spatial patterns of bird abundance and seed predation rate into patchiness at three consecutive spatial scales (broad, intermediate, and fine). The degree of patchiness and the allocation of spatial variability at different scales suggested a hierarchically nested structure in frugivory and seed predation, but a larger operational scale in seed predation than in frugivory. Scale-specific spatial distributions were explained by the response of animals to plant resource availability and habitat structure. Birds tracked fruits at large spatial scales in all systems and, within some systems, even across consecutive scales. Seed predation distribution was more responsive to habitat features than to resource availability. The reinforcement of resource tracking patterns across scales sometimes occurred simultaneously with the dilution of habitat effects, suggesting that scale dependence may emerge from trade-offs between resource acquisition and the effects of other factors, such as predation risk, on interacting animals. Our findings suggest that scale dependence in frugivory and seed predation may affect the balance of demographic effects of these interactions in plant populations.

Habitat loss must be distinguished from habitat fragmentation so that appropriate conservation management can be applied. Few studies have evaluated the independent effects of habitat loss and habitat fragmentation on the distribution of vertebrates, and none has evaluated the independent effect of changes in structural connectivity. We carried out a landscape-scale experiment to assess the independent contribution of these three processes and to examine what landscape scale factors affect the distribution of two forest-dependent arboreal rodents: the hazel dormouse Muscardinus avellanarius and the red squirrel Sciurus vulgaris. 2. Habitat loss, rather than habitat fragmentation per se, was the major driver of distribution patterns for both species. As predicted, structural connectivity (hedgerow networks) played an important role in determining the distribution of the hazel dormouse, but not of the red squirrel. 3. Our models predict that long lengths of hedgerows (> 30 km) are unlikely to increase the probability of occurrence of hazel dormouse in landscapes where there are low levels of forest cover (< 5%-10%). 4. Synthesis and applications. Our empirical findings indicate that structural connectivity and habitat loss may have additive effects on vertebrate distribution.

The stress-gradient hypothesis suggests that biotic interactions may act as major constraints on species distributions under more favourable growing conditions, while climatic constraints may dominate under unfavourable conditions. We tested this hypothesis for one focal tree species having three major competitors using broad-scale environmental data. We evaluated the variation of species co-occurrence patterns in climate space and estimated the influence of these patterns on the distribution of the focal species for current and projected future climates. Location Europe. Methods We used ICP Forest Level 1 data as well as climatic, topographic and edaphic variables. First, correlations between the relative abundance of European beech (Fagus sylvatica) and three major competitor species (Picea abies, Pinus sylvestris and Quercus robur) were analysed in environmental space, and then projected to geographic space. Second, a sensitivity analysis was performed using generalized additive models (GAM) to evaluate where and how much the predicted F. sylvatica distribution varied under current and future climates if potential competitor species were included or excluded. We evaluated if these areas coincide with current species co-occurrence patterns. Results Correlation analyses supported the stress-gradient hypothesis: towards favourable growing conditions of F. sylvatica, its abundance was strongly linked to the abundance of its competitors, while this link weakened towards unfavourable growing conditions, with stronger correlations in the south and at low elevations than in the north and at high elevations. The sensitivity analysis showed a potential spatial segregation of species with changing climate and a pronounced shift of zones where co-occurrence patterns may play a major role. Main conclusions Our results demonstrate the importance of species co-occurrence patterns for calibrating improved species distribution models for use in projections of climate effects.

One trait that shows abundant evidence for naturally segregating genetic variance in different populations of D. melanogaster is cold tolerance. Previous work has found quantitative trait loci (QTL) exclusively on the second and the third chromosomes. To gain insight into the genetic architecture of cold tolerance on the X chromosome and to compare the results with our analyses of selective sweeps, a mapping population was derived from a cross between substitution lines that solely differed in the origin of their X chromosome: one originates from a European inbred line and the other one from an African inbred line. We found a total of six QTL for cold tolerance factors on the X chromosome of D. melanogaster. Although the composite interval mapping revealed slightly different QTL profiles between sexes, a coherent model suggests that most QTL overlapped between sexes, and each explained around 5-14% of the genetic variance (which may be slightly overestimated). The allelic effects were largely additive, but we also detected two significant interactions. Taken together, this provides evidence for multiple QTL that are spread along the entire X chromosome and whose effects range from low to intermediate.

In this study, 2 in situ choice experiments were designed to test the individual as well as the interactive effects of habitat structure and schooling (with conspecifics or heterospecifics) on refuge-seeking behavior of a coral reef fish. The experiments were conducted for 3 size-classes of the common reef fish Haemulon flavolineatum, a species that shows multiple habitat shifts throughout its ontogeny. We tested the hypothesis that, due to the additive effects of schooling and structure in providing suitable refuge, fish would be more attracted to a microhabitat with conspecifics or heterospecifics than to a microhabitat or conspecifics alone. In the habitat-only experiment, early juveniles (< 3 cm fork length) showed no preference for any microhabitat structures, whereas larger fish preferred complex mangrove structure to seagrass, rubble, or coral. In the second experiment, which offered various combinations of habitat, including habitat with both conspecifics and heterospecifics, the preference for mangrove structure was completely replaced by attraction to conspecifics for all size-classes. Unexpectedly, the combination of conspecifics and habitat structure showed no additive effect. The results demonstrate that although H. flavolineatum makes multiple shifts in habitat throughout its life cycle, in the absence of other biological or environmental drivers preference for shelter habitat past the early post-settlement stage remains the same. The study further demonstrates the critical role of the presence of conspecifics in microhabitat choice, and provides a better understanding of the relative importance of these factors, whether in isolation or additively, in selection of refuge habitat by a reef fish.",6,2011,437,,241,251,10.3354/meps09264"Siddon, EC; Duffy-Anderson, JT; Mueter, FJ",Community-level response of fish larvae to environmental variability in the southeastern Bering Sea,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,Article,Larval fish; Southeastern Bering Sea; Community structure; Walleye pollock; Theragra chalcogramma; Environmental variability,"Oceanographic conditions in the southeastern Bering Sea are affected by large-scale climatic drivers (e.g. Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Aleutian Low Pressure System).

This analysis examined shifts in larval fish community composition in the southeastern Bering Sea in response to environmental variability across both warm and cold periods. Larvae were sampled in spring (May) during 5 cruises between 2002 and 2008 using oblique 60 cm bongo tows. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was used to quantify variability and reduce multi-species abundance data to major modes of species composition. Generalized additive models (GAMs) characterized spatial and temporal differences in assemblage structure as a function of environmental covariates. We identified a strong cross-shelf gradient delineating slope and shelf assemblages, an influence of water masses from the Gulf of Alaska on species composition, and the importance of nearshore areas for larval fish. Species assemblages differed between warm and cold periods, and larval abundances were generally greater in warm years. High abundances of walleye pollock in warm years contributed most to differences in Unimak Pass, outer domain, and shelf areas (geographic areas in the study region defined based on bathymetry). Sebastes spp. contributed to differences over the slope with increased abundances in cold years.

Over the past 32 years, Amazonian forest fragments ranging from 1 to 100 ha have experienced a wide array of ecological changes. Edge effects have been a dominant driver of fragment dynamics, strongly affecting forest microclimate, tree mortality, carbon storage, fauna, and other aspects of fragment ecology. However, edge-effect intensity varies markedly in space and time, and is influenced by factors such as edge age, the number of nearby edges, and the adjoining matrix of modified vegetation surrounding fragments. In our study area, the matrix has changed markedly over the course of the study (evolving from large cattle pastures to mosaics of abandoned pasture and regrowth forest) and this in turn has strongly influenced fragment dynamics and faunal persistence. Rare weather events, especially windstorms and droughts, have further altered fragment ecology. In general, populations and communities of species in fragments are hyperdynamic relative to nearby intact forest. Some edge and fragment-isolation effects have declined with a partial recovery of secondary forests around fragments, but other changes: such as altered patterns of tree recruitment, are ongoing. Fragments are highly sensitive to external vicissitudes, and even small changes in local land-management practices may drive fragmented ecosystems in markedly different directions. The effects of fragmentation are likely to interact synergistically with other anthropogenic threats such as logging, hunting, and especially fire, creating an even greater peril for the Amazonian biota.

The imminent onset of climate change will exacerbate these impacts, placing even greater pressure on already stressed resources and regions. A plethora of national climate change policies have been adopted that emphasize structural adjustment in the energy sector and increasing carbon sinks. To date, most public debate on water has focused on the direct impacts of climate change on hydrology. However, there is growing evidence that climate change policies themselves may have substantial additional and negative impacts on freshwater resources and ecosystems and may thus result in maladaptation. To avoid such maladaptation, integrated, coordinated policy making is required. In this paper, national climate change policies from Australia, Brazil, China, the European Union (EU), India, Mexico, South Africa, Tanzania, and the United Kingdom are compared to: (i) identify where negative trade-offs exist between climate change policies and freshwater resources, (ii) analyze where institutions and structures exist to optimize integration among climate, water, and biodiversity policies, and (iii) provide a much needed overview from a broad selection of countries with a view to identifying further opportunities for theoretical exploration and testing. The synergies and conflicts among climate, energy, water, and environmental policies create additional challenges for governments to develop integrated policies to deliver multiple benefits.

Results highlight variability in model ability to estimate current distributions, and the inherent large uncertainty involved in making projections into the future. CO2 fertilization through projected increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations is shown to increase forest productivity in the mechanistic process-based model (despite increased drought stress) by up to three times that of the non-CO2 fertilization scenario by the period 2050-2080, which is in stark contrast to projections of reduced habitat suitability from the niche-based models by the same period. This highlights the importance of introducing aspects of plant biogeochemistry into current niche-based models for a realistic projection of future species distributions.

Carry-over effects occur when processes in one season influence the success of an individual in the following season. This phenomenon has the potential to explain a large amount of variation in individual fitness, but so far has only been described in a limited number of species. This is largely due to difficulties associated with tracking individuals between periods of the annual cycle, but also because of a lack of research specifically designed to examine hypotheses related to carry-over effects. 2. We review the known mechanisms that drive carry-over effects, most notably macronutrient supply, and highlight the types of life histories and ecological situations where we would expect them to most often occur. We also identify a number of other potential mechanisms that require investigation, including micronutrients such as antioxidants. 3. We propose a series of experiments designed to estimate the relative contributions of extrinsic and intrinsic quality effects in the pre-breeding season, which in turn will allow an accurate estimation of the magnitude of carry-over effects. To date this has proven immensely difficult, and we hope that the experimental frameworks described here will stimulate new avenues of research vital to advancing our understanding of how carry-over effects can shape animal life histories. 4. We also explore the potential of state-dependent modelling as a tool for investigating carry-over effects, most notably for its ability to calculate optimal rates of acquisition of a multitude of resources over the course of the annual cycle, and also because it allows us to vary the strength of density-dependent relationships which can alter the magnitude of carry-over effects in either a synergistic or agonistic fashion. 5. In conclusion carry-over effects are likely to be far more widespread than currently indicated, and they are likely to be driven by a multitude of factors including both macro- and micronutrients. For this reason they could feasibly be responsible for a large amount of the observed variation in performance among individuals, and consequently warrant a wealth of new research designed specifically to decompose components of variation in fitness attributes related to processes across and within seasons.",137,2011,80,1,4,18,10.1111/j.1365-2656.2010.01740.x"Copolovici, L; Kannaste, A; Remmel, T; Vislap, V; Niinemets, U",Volatile Emissions from Alnus glutionosa Induced by Herbivory are Quantitatively Related to the Extent of Damage,JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY,Article,Biotic stress; Green leaf volatiles; Leaf ultrastructure; Photosynthesis rate; Volatile organic compounds,"Plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) elicited in response to herbivory serve as cues for parasitic and predatory insects. Knowledge about quantitative relationships between the extent of herbivore-induced damage and the quantities of VOCs released is scarce. We studied the kinetics of VOC-emissions from foliage of the deciduous tree Alnus glutinosa induced by feeding activity of larvae of the geometrid moth Cabera pusaria. Quantitative relationships between the intensity of stress and strength of plant response were determined. Intensity of biotic stress was characterized by herbivore numbers (0-8 larvae) and by the amount of leaf area eaten. The strength of plant response was characterized by monitoring (i) changes in photosynthesis, (ii) leaf ultrastructure, and (iii) plant volatiles. Net assimilation rate displayed compensatory responses in herbivore-damaged leaves compared with control leaves. This compensatory response was associated with an overall increase in chloroplast size. Feeding-induced emissions of products of the lipoxygenase pathway (LOX products; (E)-2-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexenol, 1-hexanol, and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate) peaked at day 1 after larval feeding started, followed by an increase of emissions of ubiquitous monoterpenes peaking on days 2 and 3. The emission of the monoterpene (E)-beta-ocimene and of the nerolidol-derived homoterpene 4,8-dimethyl-nona-1,3,7-triene (DMNT) peaked on day 3. Furthermore, the emission kinetics of the sesquiterpene (E,E)-alpha-farnesene tended to be biphasic with peaks on days 2 and 4 after start of larval feeding. Emission rates of the induced LOX products, of (E)-beta-ocimene and (E,E)-alpha-farnesene were positively correlated with the number of larvae feeding. In contrast, the emission of DMNT was independent of the number of feeders. These data show quantitative relationships between the strength of herbivory and the emissions of LOX products and most of the terpenoids elicited in response to feeding. Thus, herbivory-elicited LOX products and terpenoid emissions may convey both quantitative and qualitative signals to antagonists of the herbivores. In contrast, our data suggest that the feeding-induced homoterpene DMNT conveys the information ""presence of herbivores"" rather than information about the quantities of herbivores to predators and parasitoids.",28,2011,37,1,18,28,10.1007/s10886-010-9897-9"Yang, JW; Yi, HS; Kim, H; Lee, B; Lee, S; Ghim, SY; Ryu, CM",Whitefly infestation of pepper plants elicits defence responses against bacterial pathogens in leaves and roots and changes the below-ground microflora,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Article,above-ground; below-ground; plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria; plant-herbivore interactions; Ralstonia solanacearum; whitefly; Xanthomonas axonopodis,"P>1. Upon facing biotic stresses, plants orchestrate defence mechanisms via internal and external mechanisms that are mediated by signalling molecules such as salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, ethylene and various other volatile compounds. Although pathogen- and chemical-induced plant resistance has been studied extensively within the same plant compartment, the effects of above-ground (AG) insect-elicited plant defence on the resistance expression in roots and the below-ground (BG) microbial community are not well understood. 2. We assessed the effect of AG whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) attack on the elicitation of induced resistance against a leaf pathogen, Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. vesicatoria, a soil-borne pathogen, Ralstonia solanacearum, and on BG modifications of the rhizosphere microflora in peppers (Capsicum annuum). 3. Symptom development caused by the two bacterial pathogens on leaves and roots was significantly reduced in whitefly-exposed plants as compared to controls. A combined treatment with benzothiadiazole (BTH) and whitefly caused an additive effect on induced resistance, indicating that whitefly-induced plant defence can utilize salicylic acid (SA)-dependent signalling. To obtain further genetic evidence of this phenomenon, we evaluated the gene expression of Capsicum annuum pathogenesis-related protein (CaPR) 1, CaPR4, CaPR10 and Ca protease inhibitor II, and observed increased expression after BTH and/or whitefly treatment indicating that AG whitefly infestation elicited SA and jasmonic acid signalling in AG and BG. Since the expression pattern of PR genes in the roots differed, we assessed microbial diversity in plants treated with BTH and/or whitefly. 4. In addition to eliciting BG defence responses, a whitefly infestation of the leaves augmented the population of root-associated Gram-positive bacteria and fungi, which may have positively affected plant growth and induced systemic resistance. Whitefly feeding reduced plant size, which usually occurs as a consequence of the high costs of direct resistance induction. 5. Synthesis.

We show that impacts of invasive predators can be classified as either functional or numerical, and that they interact with other threats through both habitat- and community-mediated pathways. Ecosystem context and invasive predator identity are central in shaping variability in these relationships and their outcomes. Greater recognition of the ecological complexities between major processes that threaten biodiversity, including changing spatial and temporal relationships among species, is required to both advance ecological theory and improve conservation actions and outcomes.

Colonization and autogenic processes alter the fragments' composition and function. Fragment metrics affect colonization. Autogenic processes are antagonized by disturbances and modulated by abiotic inputs. Fragment alterations by autogenic processes may explain the continuous species substitution detected in some fragments or the species persistence in others. Reverse fragmentation, a natural process in commonly disturbed landscapes, challenges the avoidance-of-habitat disturbance as the ultimate strategy for biodiversity conservation and stresses the importance of pioneer species that promote succession as resilience elements in fragmented landscapes.

To contribute to closing this gap, this study applies a methodology for exploring complex linkages between ecosystem services and human wellbeing. This builds on emerging frameworks for studying multiple dimensions of human wellbeing, drawing on Amartya Sen's capabilities approach to human development. The approach is applied to an empirical case study of three sites adjacent to native tropical forest in western Rwanda. The value of exploring social complexity in ecosystem services research is illustrated through its contribution to understanding a) different types of values; b) disaggregation of people; c) power relations and their influence on trade-offs; d) the importance of multiple land use types in the landscape; and e) changes and their drivers at multiple scales. The analysis reveals that the majority of services valued by forest-adjacent Rwandan inhabitants are not provided by tropical forests but by other habitats.

Individual management interventions can influence this balance by altering some, but not all of these potential drivers. For example, no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) on coral reefs can increase herbivorous fish abundance, thereby decreasing macroalgal coverage, but have limited influence on water quality and other vagile drivers. We compared the relative influence of seven abiotic water quality variables to that of MPA status on macroalgal coverage in 14 sites (5 of which are within no-take MPAs) over four consecutive seasons (summer through to spring) within the marginal coral reef habitats of Moreton Bay, Australia. Algal cover was quantified by taking 100 photo quadrats per site per sampling with the relative importance of our eight factors determined statistically by generalised additive models. Overall, temporal variations in total macroalgal cover and four out of five important macroalgal genera correlated with factors other than marine protection, especially water temperature, salinity, water clarity (Secchi disc) and nutrient concentration (nitrogen and phosphorus). However, seasonal variations in cover of individual macroalgal genera did not follow strong temporal trends and were not consistent with total macroalgal cover, meaning that different factors were significant for different algal genera. Consequently, we advocate for caution in determining the influence of impact gradients by exclusively measuring total macroalgal cover.

Here, we present the results of a three-year field and a two-year glasshouse experiment, in which we assessed responses of Calluna vulgaris heathlands to the single and combined effects of drought events (D) and N fertilization (D: 25% precipitation reduction in the field experiment and 20-50% soil water content reduction in the glasshouse experiment; N fertilization: 35kg N ha(-1)year(-1)). We examined the effects of D and N treatments on growth responses of the dominant dwarf shrub Calluna vulgaris (in terms of biomass production and allocation, tissue C-13 signatures and C:N ratios) in relation to two plant life-history stages and different ecotypes' (sub-Atlantic vs. subcontinental heathlands). Plant responses varied strongly with life-history stage, and the interaction of N and D showed lower effects than would be expected based on additive responses to single factors. While D treatments had no effects on Calluna in the building phase (ca. ten-year-old plants), seedlings (particularly one-year-old plants) were highly susceptible to drought. Differences in response patterns were attributable to the high shoot-root ratios typical of young Calluna plants. These ratios decreased with progressing life history as a result of increasing below-ground biomass investments. Below-ground biomass production and shoot-root ratios differed between plants from the different heathland sites. Tissue C-13 signatures decreased and C:N ratios increased with plant age as a result of decreasing evaporative demands (per unit root biomass). N fertilization increases the shoot-root ratios and thereby the drought susceptibility of Calluna plants.Synthesis.

Maintaining or re-creating natural disturbance regimes is therefore the focus of many conservation programmes. A key challenge, however, is to understand how co-occurring disturbances interact to affect biodiversity. We experimentally tested for the interactive effects of prescribed fire and large macropod herbivores on the web-building spider assemblage of a eucalypt forest understorey and investigated the role of vegetation in mediating these effects using path analysis. Fire had strong negative effects on the density of web-building spiders, which were partly mediated by effects on vegetation structure, while negative effects of large herbivores on web density were not related to changes in vegetation. Fire amplified the effects of large herbivores on spiders, both via vegetation-mediated pathways and by increasing herbivore activity. The importance of vegetation-mediated pathways and fire-herbivore interactions differed for web density and richness and also differed between web types. Our results demonstrate that for some groups of web-building spiders, the effects of co-occurring disturbance drivers may be mostly additive, whereas for other groups, interactions between drivers can amplify disturbance effects. In our study system, the use of prescribed fire in the presence of high densities of herbivores could lead to reduced densities and altered composition of web-building spiders, with potential cascading effects through the arthropod food web.

We then applied a generalized linear modeling framework and constructed cumulative effects models capable of predicting in-stream response to future surface-mine development within the context of other landuse activities. Predictive models provided precise estimates of specific conductance (model R-2 <= 0.77 and cross-validated R-2 <= 0.74), Se (0.74 and 0.70), and benthic macroinvertebrate community composition (0.72 and 0.65). Deletion tests supported the conclusion that stream degradation across the region is the result of complex, but predictable, additive and interactive effects of surface mining, underground mining, and residential development. Furthermore, we found that as stressors other than surface mining are factored out completely, the surface-mining level that results in exceedance of the 300 mu S/cm conductivity benchmark increased from 4.4% in the presence of other stressors to 16.6% when only surface mining was present. Last, extrapolating model results to all unsampled stream segments in the region (n = 26,135), we predicted high levels of chemical (33%) and biological (67%) impairment to streams on the current landscape.

We addressed 3 topics embedded in general stress ecology and evolutionary ecology that are relevant to arrive at a better evaluation of the risk of low contaminant levels in aquatic systems: 1) delayed effects of contaminants, 2) interactions between contaminants and biotic interactors, and 3) vulnerability to contaminants under global warming. We developed these topics by capitalizing on the key insights obtained using damselflies as model organisms. First, delayed contaminant effects on important fitness-related effects exist during the larval stage and after metamorphosis in the adult stage. Second, synergistic interactions of contaminants with bacteria and predation risk have been demonstrated, and we present advances in the mechanistic understanding of these synergisms with biotic interactors. Third, we illustrate the strength of assessing the effect of contaminants under global warming using a space-for-time substitution approach and the need to consider temperature extremes. These studies using damselflies as model organisms highlight the relevance of considering contaminant effects after the exposure period and in the presence of natural stressors, such as predation risk and higher temperatures. They further highlight the need for spatially explicit risk-assessment and conservation tools. These insights are relevant for most aquatic taxa. Indeed most aquatic taxa have a complex life cycle, are strongly affected by predation risk and by warming, and show latitudinal gradients.

Observations of high density of the invasive springtail (Collembola), Hypogastrura manubrialis in heavily grazed renosterveld vegetation in the Western Cape, South Africa, raised the question of whether the invasion was favored by changes in plant litter quality associated with habitat disturbance in this vegetation type. To examine the likely mechanisms underlying the high abundance of H.manubrialis, cages with three types of naturally occurring litter with different nutrient content were placed out in the area and collected after different periods of time. Hypogastrura manubrialis was mainly found in the nutrient-rich litter of the yellowbush (Galenia africana), which responds positively to disturbance in the form of overgrazing. This suggests that invasion may have been facilitated by a positive interaction with this grazing resistant plant. By contrast, indigenous Collembola were least abundant in yellowbush litter. Negative correlations between high abundance of H.manubrialis and the abundance and diversity of other species suggest that competitive interactions might underlie low abundance of these other species at the patch level. Group behavior enables H.manubrialis to utilize efficiently this ephemeral, high quality resource, and might improve its competitive ability. The results suggest that interactions among environmental change drivers may lead to unforeseen invasion effects. H.manubrialis is not likely to be very successful in un-grazed renosterveld, but in combination with grazing, favoring the nutrient-rich yellowbush, it may become highly invasive.

In annual plants, vegetative size (a function of age at flowering) affects resources available for seed production, whereas exposure to mutualists, antagonists, and abiotic stresses in the environment (functions of Julian date of flowering) influences success in converting resources into offspring. The inherent tight correlation between age, size, and environment obscures their independent fitness contributions. We isolated the fitness effects of these factors by experimentally manipulating the correlation between age at flowering and date of flowering in Brassica rapa. We staggered the planting dates of families with differing ages at flowering to produce experimental populations in which age at flowering and date of flowering were positively, negatively, or uncorrelated. In all populations, plants with an early date of flowering produced more seed than those flowering late, regardless of age or size at flowering onset. The temporal environment was thus the principal driver of selection on flowering time, but its importance relative to that of age and size varied with the presence/absence of herbivores and seed predators.",0,2015,69,8,2018,2033,10.1111/evo.12709"Allen, CD; Breshears, DD; McDowell, NG",On underestimation of global vulnerability to tree mortality and forest die-off from hotter drought in the Anthropocene,ECOSPHERE,Article,carbon starvation; climate change; CO2 fertilization; drought; ESA Centennial Paper; extreme events; forest die-off; forests; hydraulic failure; insect pests; pathogens; tree mortality; woodlands,"Patterns, mechanisms, projections, and consequences of tree mortality and associated broadscale forest die-off due to drought accompanied by warmer temperatures-""hotter drought'', an emerging characteristic of the Anthropocene-are the focus of rapidly expanding literature. Despite recent observational, experimental, and modeling studies suggesting increased vulnerability of trees to hotter drought and associated pests and pathogens, substantial debate remains among research, management and policy-making communities regarding future tree mortality risks. We summarize key mortality-relevant findings, differentiating between those implying lesser versus greater levels of vulnerability. Evidence suggesting lesser vulnerability includes forest benefits of elevated [CO2] and increased water-use efficiency; observed and modeled increases in forest growth and canopy greening; widespread increases in woody-plant biomass, density, and extent; compensatory physiological, morphological, and genetic mechanisms; dampening ecological feedbacks; and potential mitigation by forest management. In contrast, recent studies document more rapid mortality under hotter drought due to negative tree physiological responses and accelerated biotic attacks. Additional evidence suggesting greater vulnerability includes rising background mortality rates; projected increases in drought frequency, intensity, and duration; limitations of vegetation models such as inadequately represented mortality processes; warming feedbacks from die-off; and wildfire synergies. Grouping these findings we identify ten contrasting perspectives that shape the vulnerability debate but have not been discussed collectively. We also present a set of global vulnerability drivers that are known with high confidence: (1) droughts eventually occur everywhere; (2) warming produces hotter droughts; (3) atmospheric moisture demand increases nonlinearly with temperature during drought; (4) mortality can occur faster in hotter drought, consistent with fundamental physiology; (5) shorter droughts occur more frequently than longer droughts and can become lethal under warming, increasing the frequency of lethal drought nonlinearly; and (6) mortality happens rapidly relative to growth intervals needed for forest recovery. These high-confidence drivers, in concert with research supporting greater vulnerability perspectives, support an overall viewpoint of greater forest vulnerability globally. We surmise that mortality vulnerability is being discounted in part due to difficulties in predicting threshold responses to extreme climate events.

Host-parasite interactions are fundamentally important drivers of evolutionary processes, but a lack of understanding of the genes involved in the host's response to chronic parasite insult makes it particularly difficult to understand the mechanisms of host life history trade-offs and the adaptive dynamics involved. Here, we examine the genetic basis of gastrointestinal nematode (Trichostrongylus tenuis) burden in 695 red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scotica) individuals genotyped at 384 genome-wide SNPs. We first use genome-wide association to identify individual SNPs associated with nematode burden. We then partition genome-wide heritability to identify chromosomes with greater heritability than expected from gene content, due to harbouring a multitude of additive SNPs with individually undetectable effects. We identified five SNPs on five chromosomes that accounted for differences of up to 556 worms per bird, but together explained at best 4.9% of the phenotypic variance. These SNPs were closely linked to genes representing a range of physiological processes including the immune system, protein degradation and energy metabolism. Genome partitioning indicated genome-wide heritability of up to 29% and three chromosomes with excess heritability of up to 4.3% (total 8.9%).

This study examined the effects of an invasive seaweed (Sargassum muticum) on the structure and functioning of a synthetic macroalgal assemblage and tested explicitly whether these effects varied with nutrient enrichment and ocean warming. Overall, the presence of S. muticum increased assemblage productivity rates and warming altered algal assemblage structure, which was characterised by a decrease in kelp and an increase in ephemeral green algae. The effects of S. muticum on total algal biomass accumulation, however, varied with nutrient enrichment and warming, producing antagonistic cumulative effects on total algal biomass accumulation.

Additionally, evidence suggests that co-occurring invaders can interact to amplify or mitigate one another's impacts on ecosystems. However, there has not been a quantitative review on interactions among multiple invasive animals. Here I use a meta-analysis approach to show that, across a global scale, the mean interaction among invaders was to reduce one another's performance. This pattern was consistent when considering interactions between marine animals but interactions were neutral overall in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. Crucially, individual studies showed that neutral interactions were the most common interaction type. Further, I demonstrate that the combined ecological impacts of multiple invaders were frequently the sum of their independent effects (additive) but the mean effect was non-additive and less than predicted (antagonistic).

Even though empirical evidence is scarce, theory predicts that the importance of both top-down and bottom-up forces may decrease as physical stress increases. Here, we experimentally evaluate in the field the separate and interactive effect of salinity, nutrient availability, and crab herbivory on plant above-and belowground biomass, as well as on sexual and clonal reproduction in the salt marsh plant Spartina densiflora. Results show that the outcome of the interaction between nutrient availability and herbivory is highly context dependent, not only varying with the abiotic context (i.e., with or without increased salinity stress), but also with the dependent variable considered. Contrary to theoretical predictions, our results show that, consistently across different measured variables, salinity stress did not cancel bottom-up (i.e., nutrients) or top-down (i.e., consumers) control, but has additive effects. Our results support emerging theory by highlighting that, under many conditions, physical stress can act additively with, or even stimulate, consumer control, especially in cases where the physical stress is only experienced by basal levels of the trophic chain.

We analyzed spatial structure in the frequency and intensity of interactions that vertebrate pollinators (birds and lizards) and invertebrate antagonists (florivores, nectar larcenists, and seed predators) had when interacting with the insular plant Isoplexis canariensis, and their effect on plant fitness. Spatially autocorrelated variation in plant reproductive success (fruit and viable seed set) emerged from the combined action of mutualists and antagonists, rather than reflecting the spatial pattern of any specific animal group. However, the influence of antagonists on plant fitness was stronger primarily due to the florivores' action on earlier reproductive stages, consuming and damaging floral structures before the arrival of pollinators. Our results indicate that the early action of antagonists creates hotspots of increased plant damage, where the effects of later acting mutualists are not translated into increased reproductive benefits. We foresee the potential for antagonists to shape the intra-population mosaics of plant fitness in situations where antagonists outnumber mutualists, when their interactions occur before those of mutualists, and when mutualists can detect and avoid damaged plants while foraging. Severely damaged plants in antagonistic hotspots might be excluded from the mating network and render a limited production of viable seeds, reducing both the growth rate of the plant population and the effective population size.",0,2015,96,8,2181,2191,10.1890/14-2467.1"Ranelli, LB; Hendricks, WQ; Lynn, JS; Kivlin, SN; Rudgers, JA",Biotic and abiotic predictors of fungal colonization in grasses of the Colorado Rockies,DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,Article,Climate change; distribution model; endophyte; mycorrhizal fungi; plant-fungal interactions; symbiosis,"AimFungal symbionts are ubiquitous in plants and can mitigate abiotic stressors associated with climate change.

MethodsAcross seven replicate altitudinal gradients, spanning c.1400 vertical meters, we scored fungal colonization for 46 grass species. We documented altitudinal clines in colonization by both above-ground and below-ground fungal symbionts for the first time, including localized foliar endophytes (LFE) and systemic endophytes (epichloae) in leaves and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate endophytes (DSE) in roots. For a subset of 16 well-sampled grass species, we used model selection procedures to evaluate the relative importance of geography, edaphic factors and host plant identity. We also assessed the influence of host phylogenetic relatedness and colonization by co-infecting fungi. ResultsLevels of fungal colonization varied strongly with host plant identity, but the effects of particular host species were not consistent across fungal groups. In addition to the influence of host identity, epichloae colonization declined with elevation and varied with geography (latitude/longitude) and edaphic factors. Geography and collection date were important predictors of LFE colonization, with higher colonization later in the growing season. Colonization estimates for the obligately plant-associated fungi (epichloae, AMF) were phylogenetically conserved across the grass supertree. Positive correlations between AMF and DSE, which remained even after accounting for host plant relatedness, suggested possible synergisms between these fungal groups.

Analyzing data from Pacific Fisheries Information Network between 1990 and 2010, we show that over 17 million kg of fish and shellfish were kept for personal use. We used general additive models to examine patterns in proportion of personal use versus price for the top 10 species retained over the 20-year period for each of the three population groups: Washington commercial tribal (indigenous) fishing operators, Washington commercial nontribal operators, and California commercial fishing operators. Out of the 26 species-price relationships tested, only one fits the market relationship with statistical significance and the model failed to predict personal use patterns for any of the other species. We conclude that market sensitivity is not a reliable predictor for subsistence behavior.

However, patterns and causes of -diversity loss, especially at a within-field scale, have remained unexplored. We examined -diversity declines in plants, butterflies and orthopterans resulting from land abandonment and intensification in semi-natural grasslands on paddy margins at a within-field scale in relation to changes in disturbance frequency and surrounding landscapes by surveying eight abandoned, thirteen traditional and ten intensive paddy terraces. Three indices, the additive partitioning of species richness ((add)) and the turnover ((tu)) and nestedness ((ne)) components of Jaccard dissimilarity of plants and herbivores, were used to evaluate different aspects of -diversity. We hypothesized that biotic homogenization due to abandonment and intensification would be expressed as low spatiotemporal (add) and (tu), low spatial (ne) and high temporal (ne). The spatial and temporal (add) of plants and herbivores were higher in traditional terraces than in others. Changes in mowing frequency caused direct declines in butterfly (add) and indirectly decreased herbivore (add) through diminished plant (add) in abandoned and intensified terraces. Neighbouring forests increased plant spatial and butterfly temporal (add) and (tu). Abandoned terraces had higher orthopteran spatial and plant temporal (tu) than traditional terraces.

LocationShiretoko National Park, Shiretoko Peninsular, Hokkaido, Japan. MethodsWe investigated the diversity of eight groups of organisms (taxa) in forests of northern Japan, and calculated the distance decay of taxonomic/functional similarity (SOrensen's -diversity) along an elevational gradient. A null model was used to separate functional turnover from taxonomic turnover. We then simulated how taxonomic/functional turnover along the gradient would be changed after non-random loss of species sensitive to mammalian herbivory. ResultsWe found that each group showed elevational decay in taxonomic similarity. Along an elevational gradient, species groups structured by stronger dispersal limitation showed faster species turnover. This suggested differences in the process of climate-induced species reassembly among the groups. We also found that elevational turnover of communities based on functional traits tended to be lower than that based on taxonomic identity for the majority of the groups, supporting our hypothesis of functional redundancy across the elevational gradient. We thus speculated that climate-induced emergence of taxonomically novel communities may have limited influence on critical ecosystem processes supported by functional diversity. Furthermore, while random species loss did not change functional turnover, non-random loss of species attributable to mammalian herbivory substantially accelerated elevational functional turnover of the taxa. This suggested a possible loss of the functional redundancy of communities.

Social individuals were significantly more likely to dominate in both resource-poor and resource-rich, heterogeneous landscapes where individuals exhibit all 3 behavioral traits. Similar environment-behavior interactions may have shaped the evolution of sociality from solitary territoriality across a broad range of taxa.",0,2015,26,4,1051,1059,10.1093/beheco/arv046"Baker, NR; Allison, SD",Ultraviolet photodegradation facilitates microbial litter decomposition in a Mediterranean climate,ECOLOGY,Article,decomposition; extracellular enzymes; lignin; microbes; photodegradation; ultraviolet radiation,"Rates of litter decomposition in dryland ecosystems are consistently underestimated by decomposition models driven by temperature, moisture, and litter chemistry. The most common explanation for this pattern is that ultraviolet radiation (UV) increases decomposition through photodegradation of the litter lignin fraction. Alternatively, UV could increase decomposition through effects on microbial activity. To assess the mechanisms underlying UV photodegradation in a semiarid climate, we exposed high- and low-lignin litter to ambient and blocked UV over 15 months in a Mediterranean ecosystem. We hypothesized that UV would increase litter mass loss, that UV would preferentially increase mass loss of the lignin fraction, and that UV would have a negative effect on microbial activity. Consistent with our first hypothesis, we found that UV-blocking reduced litter mass loss from 16% to 1% in high-lignin litter and from 29% to 17% in low-lignin litter. Contrary to our second hypothesis, UV treatment did not have a significant effect on lignin content in either litter type. Instead, UV-blocking significantly reduced cellulose and hemicellulose mass loss in both litter types. Contrary to our third hypothesis, we observed a positive effect of UV on both fungal abundance and the potential activities of several assayed extracellular enzymes. Additionally, under ambient UV only, we found significant correlations between potential activities of cellulase and oxidase enzymes and both the concentrations and degradation rates of their target compounds. Our results indicate that UV is a significant driver of litter mass loss in Mediterranean ecosystems, but not solely because UV directly degrades carbon compounds such as lignin. Rather, UV facilitates microbial degradation of litter compounds, such as cellulose and hemicellulose. Thus, unexpectedly high rates of litter decomposition previously attributed directly to UV in dryland ecosystems may actually derive from a synergistic interaction between UV and microbes.",0,2015,96,7,1994,2003,10.1890/14-1482.1"Silva, LCR; Doane, TA; Correa, RS; Valverde, V; Pereira, EIP; Horwath, WR",Iron-mediated stabilization of soil carbon amplifies the benefits of ecological restoration in degraded lands,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,Article,carbon sequestration; iron; land restoration; soil-plant interactions; stable isotopes; urban waste,"Recent observations across a 14-year restoration chronosequence have shown an unexpected accumulation of soil organic carbon in strip-mined areas of central Brazil. This was attributed to the rapid plant colonization that followed the incorporation of biosolids into exposed regoliths, but the specific mechanisms involved in the stabilization of carbon inputs from the vegetation remained unclear. Using isotopic and elemental analyses, we tested the hypothesis that plant-derived carbon accumulation was triggered by the formation of iron-coordinated complexes, stabilized into physically protected (occluded) soil fractions. Confirming this hypothesis, we identified a fast formation of microaggregates shortly after the application of iron-rich biosolids, which was characterized by a strong association between pyrophosphate-extractable iron and plant-derived organic matter. The formation of microaggregates preceded the development of macroaggregates, which drastically increased soil carbon content (similar to 140 Mg C/ha) a few years after restoration. Consistent with previous theoretical work, iron-coordinated organic complexes served as nuclei for aggregate formation, reflecting the synergistic effect of biological, chemical, and physical mechanisms of carbon stabilization in developing soils. Nevertheless, iron was not the only factor affecting soil carbon content. The highest carbon accumulation was observed during the period of highest plant diversity (>30 species; years 3-6), declining significantly with the exclusion of native species by invasive grasses (years 9-14). Furthermore, the increasing dominance of invasive grasses was associated with a steady decline in the concentration of soil nitrogen and phosphorus per unit of accumulated carbon. These results demonstrate the importance of interdependent ecological and biogeochemical processes, and the role of soil-plant interactions in determining the success of restoration efforts. In contrast with previous but unsuccessful attempts to restore mined areas through nutrient application alone, iron-mediated stabilization of vegetation inputs favored the regeneration of a barren stable state that had persisted for over five decades since disturbance. The effectiveness of coupled organic matter and iron fertilization, combined with management of invasive species, has the possibility to enhance terrestrial carbon sequestration and accelerate the restoration of degraded lands, while addressing important challenges associated with urban waste disposal.",0,2015,25,5,1226,1234,10.1890/14-2151.1"Irizar, A; Rivas, C; Garcia-Velasco, N; de Cerio, FG; Etxebarria, J; Marigomez, I; Soto, M",Establishment of toxicity thresholds in subpopulations of coelomocytes (amoebocytes vs. eleocytes) of Eisenia fetida exposed in vitro to a variety of metals: implications for biomarker measurements,ECOTOXICOLOGY,Article,Eisenia; Amoebocytes; Eleocytes; Metal toxicity thresholds; NRU,"Coelomocytes comprise the immune system of earthworms and due to their sensitivity responding to a wide range of pollutants have been widely used as target cells in soil ecotoxicology. Recently, in vitro assays with primary cultures of coelomocytes based in the neutral red uptake (NRU) assay have been developed as promising tools for toxicity assessment chemical in a reproducible and cost-effective manner. However, NRU showed a bimodal dose-response curve previously described after in vivo and in vitro exposure of earthworm coelomocytes to pollutants. This response could be related with alterations in the relative proportion of coelomocyte subpopulations, amoebocytes and eleocytes. Thus, the aims of the present work were, first, to establish the toxicity thresholds that could be governed by different cell-specific sensitivities of coelomocytes subpopulations against a series of metals (Cu, Cd, Pb, Ni), and second to understand the implication that coelomocyte population dynamics (eleocytes vs. amoebocytes) after exposure to pollutants can have on the viability of coelomocytes (measured by NRU assay) as biomarker of general stress in soil health assessment. Complementarily flow cytometric analyses were applied to obtain correlative information about single cells (amoebocytes and eleocytes) in terms of size and complexity, changes in their relative proportion and mortality rates. The results indicated a clear difference in sensitivity of eleocytes and amoebocytes against metal exposure, being eleocytes more sensitive. The bimodal dose-response curve of NRU after in vitro exposure of primary cultures of coelomocytes to metals revealed an initial mortality of eleocytes (decreased NRU), followed by an increased complexity of amoebocytes (enhanced phagocytosis) and massive mortality of eleocytes (increased NRU), to give raise to a massive mortality of amoebocytes (decrease NRU). A synergistic effect on NRU was exerted by the exposure to high Cu concentrations and acidic pH (elicited by the metal itself), whereas the effects on NRU produced after exposure to Cd, Ni and Pb were due solely to the presence of metals, being the acidification of culture medium meaningless.",0,2015,24,5,1004,1013,10.1007/s10646-015-1441-9"Cheng, BS; Bible, JM; Chang, AL; Ferner, MC; Wasson, K; Zabin, CJ; Latta, M; Deck, A; Todgham, AE; Grosholz, ED",Testing local and global stressor impacts on a coastal foundation species using an ecologically realistic framework,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Article,additive; climate change; diel-cycling hypoxia; latent; multiple stressors; Olympia oyster; Ostrea lurida; salinity; synergy; warming,"Despite the abundance of literature on organismal responses to multiple environmental stressors, most studies have not matched the timing of experimental manipulations with the temporal pattern of stressors in nature. We test the interactive effects of diel-cycling hypoxia with both warming and decreased salinities using ecologically realistic exposures. Surprisingly, we found no evidence of negative synergistic effects on Olympia oyster growth; rather, we found only additive and opposing effects of hypoxia (detrimental) and warming (beneficial). We suspect that diel-cycling provided a temporal refuge that allowed physiological compensation. We also tested for latent effects of warming and hypoxia to low-salinity tolerance using a seasonal delay between stressor events. However, we did not find a latent effect, rather a threshold survival response to low salinity that was independent of early life-history exposure to warming or hypoxia. The absence of synergism is likely the result of stressor treatments that mirror the natural timing of environmental stressors. We provide environmental context for laboratory experimental data by examining field time series environmental data from four North American west coast estuaries and find heterogeneous environmental signals that characterize each estuary, suggesting that the potential stressor exposure to oysters will drastically differ over moderate spatial scales. This heterogeneity implies that efforts to conserve and restore oysters will require an adaptive approach that incorporates knowledge of local conditions.

We follow the ideas first laid out by MacArthur and MacArthur in 1961 who found that in the eastern USA higher tree canopies supported more bird species, which they attributed to an increase of available niches as forests grow taller. We test if their findings can be generalized over large regions and other taxa by employing novel methods and using current datasets.

The analysis was conducted globally and within biogeographical realms. We modeled richness, using tree canopy height and other environmental correlates, with generalized additive models and geographically weighted regressions. ResultsGlobally, tree canopy height proved to be of lesser importance in explaining species richness patterns compared to other environmental drivers. Within biogeographical realms, tree canopy height was found to be a more important predictor of diversity in the Neotropic and Australian realms. Regional patterns show that tree canopy height has an important effect on diversity of amphibians throughout the world and in several tropical regions across taxa.

Most studies on inbreeding-environment (I-E) interactions use one or two stress levels, whereby the resolution of the possible stress and inbreeding depression interaction is low. Here we produced Drosophila melanogaster replicate populations, maintained at three different population sizes (10, 50 and a control size of 500) for 25 generations. A nutritional stress gradient was imposed on the replicate populations by exposing them to 11 different concentrations of yeast in the developmental medium. We assessed the consequences of nutritional stress by scoring egg-to-adult viability and body mass of emerged flies. We found: (1) unequivocal evidence for I-E interactions in egg-to-adult viability and to a lesser extent in dry body mass, with inbreeding depression being more severe under higher levels of nutritional stress; (2) a steeper increase in inbreeding depression for replicate populations of size 10 with increasing nutritional stress than for replicate populations of size 50; (3) a nonlinear norm of reaction between inbreeding depression and nutritional stress; and (4) a faster increase in number of lethal equivalents in replicate populations of size 10 compared with replicate populations of size 50 with increasing nutritional stress levels.

Although the effects of the abiotic environment and prey evolution on ecological community dynamics have been studied separately, these factors can also have interactive effects. Here we used bacteria ciliate microcosm experiments to test for eco-evolutionary dynamics in fluctuating environments. Specifically, we followed population dynamics and a prey defence trait over time when populations were exposed to regular changes of bottom-up or top-down stressors, or combinations of these. We found that the rate of evolution of a defence trait was significantly lower in fluctuating compared with stable environments, and that the defence trait evolved to lower levels when two environmental stressors changed recurrently. The latter suggests that top-down and bottom-up changes can have additive effects constraining evolutionary response within populations. The differences in evolutionary trajectories are explained by fluctuations in population sizes of the prey and the predator, which continuously alter the supply of mutations in the prey and strength of selection through predation.

The extreme dry and hot summer 2003 significantly decreased discharge, increased water temperature and affected water chemistry of the investigated springs. Ecological resilience and elasticity against the climatic extreme event differed significantly between communities dependent on their previous impact by acidification. Springs which were less affected by acidification performed higher resilience and elasticity than strongly acidified springs.

However, the effects of interactions between bark beetle outbreaks and subsequent wildfires on forest succession remain poorly understood. We collected data in dry mixed conifer forests across Idaho and western Montana to test whether vegetation responses differ between sites experiencing single and repeated disturbances. We compared tree seedling density and age, surface fuel loading, and stand structure characteristics in stands that experienced either high severity wildfire, large-scale tree mortality from bark beetles, or stands that experienced high bark beetle mortality followed by severe wildfire within 3-8 years of attack. Tree seedling density was 300-400% higher in gray bark beetle-affected stands than burned sites, but there was no evidence that a beetle and wildfire interaction affected seedling densities. The age distribution of Douglas-fir and grand fir seedlings in stands with repeated disturbances differed from those that only experienced wildfire, suggesting that seed availability varies between these stands. Though both bark beetle outbreaks and wildfires resulted in the death of numerous large trees and surface woody fuel loads 100-200% greater than control sites, the creation of large snags and higher fuel loads across the landscape may have ecological benefits. Compounding effects of bark beetle activity and wildfires were not observed in surface fuel loadings or stand densities. Overall, the effects of high severity wildfire drove post-disturbance fuel complexes and succession whereas the effects of Dendroctonus pseudotsugae and Dendroctonus brevicomis outbreaks before wildfires resulted in minimal post-wildfire differences.

Intraspecific genetic diversity of long-lived plants like trees might shape patterns of herbivory by different guilds of herbivores that trees experience through time. However, previous studies on plant genetic diversity effects on herbivores have been largely short-term. We investigated how tree genotypic variation and diversity influence herbivory of silver birch Betula pendula in a long-term field experiment. Using clones of eight genotypes, we constructed experimental plots consisting of one, two, four or eight genotypes, and measured damage by five guilds of arthropod herbivores twice a year over three different years (four, six and nine years after the experiment was established). Genotypes varied significantly for most types of herbivore damage, but genotype resistance rankings often shifted over time, and none of the clones was more resistant than all others to all types of herbivores. At the plot level, birch genotypic diversity had significant positive additive effect on leaf rollers and negative non-additive effects on chewing herbivores and gall makers. In contrast, leaf-mining and leaf-tying damage was not influenced by birch genotypic diversity. Within diverse plots, the direction of genotypic diversity effects varied depending on birch genotype, some having lower and some having higher herbivory in mixed stands. This research highlights the importance of long-term studies including different feeding guilds of herbivores to understand the effects of plant genetic diversity on arthropod communities.

We demonstrate that (per) chlorate and nitrate are antagonistic inhibitors and resistance is cross-inducible implying that these compounds share at least one common mechanism of resistance.

We found that mutants in Dde_2702 (Rex), a repressor of the central sulfate-reduction pathway were resistant to both (per) chlorate and nitrate. In general, Rex derepresses its regulon in response to increasing intracellular NADH: NAD_ratios. In cells in which respiratory sulfate reduction is inhibited, NADH: NAD_ratios should increase leading to derepression of the sulfate-reduction pathway. In support of this, in (per) chlorate or nitrate-stressed wild-type G20 we observed higher NADH: NAD_ratios, increased transcripts and increased peptide counts for genes in the core Rex regulon.

Spinner dolphins display a predictable diurnal behavioural pattern where they forage offshore at night and return to sheltered bays during daytime to rest. These bays, which are also subject to considerable use by humans, have long been recognized as key habitats for this species although the extent to which dolphins rely on specific characteristics of these habitats for rest has not been quantified. An integration of boat-based and land-based group focal follow sampling regimes and three gradient boosting generalized additive models were developed to identify habitat features that contribute to the occurrence of resting spinner dolphins in coastal waters off Hawai'i Island. Two in-bay' models used data collected within bays, and a third coastal' model (near-shore, outside of bays) used data collected both inside and outside of bays. The coastal model identified that spinner dolphins were unlikely to rest outside sheltered bays. In-bay models showed that dolphins rested throughout daylight hours within bays with a peak resting period between 10.00h to 14.00h. The models also identified bottom-substrate-type as an important predictor of rest. Pseudo R-2 values of 061 and 070 for the in-bay models and 066 for the coastal model showed that these models provided a good fit to the behavioural data for the occurrence of resting spinner dolphins.Synthesis and application.

Early life stages of marine organisms are potentially vulnerable to the stressors associated with global change, but identifying general patterns across studies, species and response variables is challenging. This review represents the first meta-analysis of multistressor studies to target early marine life stages (embryo to larvae), particularly between temperature, salinity and pH as these are the best studied. Knowledge gaps in research on multiple abiotic stressors and early life stages are also identified. The meta-analysis yielded several key results: (1) Synergistic interactions (65% of individual tests) are more common than additive (17%) or antagonistic (17%) interactions. (2) Larvae are generally more vulnerable than embryos to thermal and pH stress. (3) Survival is more likely than sublethal responses to be affected by thermal, salinity and pH stress. (4) Interaction types vary among stressors, ontogenetic stages and biological responses, but they are more consistent among phyla. (5) Ocean acidification is a greater stressor for calcifying than noncalcifying larvae. Despite being more ecologically realistic than single-factor studies, multifactorial studies may still oversimplify complex systems, and so meta-analyses of the data from them must be cautiously interpreted with regard to extrapolation to field conditions.

LocationEurope. MethodWe modelled the response of European vegetation to changes in land use, climate and CO2 by combining the land-use model Dyna-CLUE (based on the CORINE land-cover data) and the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS. Two reforestation options were explored: maintaining the current range of tree species (EFI) or promoting naturally occurring tree species (NAT). Climate data from two general circulation models and two SRES scenarios (A2 and B1) were used. The broad habitat types were classified according to a combination of land use and the dominant plant species. ResultsOur models predicted that croplands and grasslands are expected to decrease due to land-use change. Although climate change has a negative effect on needle-leaved forest, it is expected to maintain its area or even increase in the EFI reforestation option while mediterranean, broad-leaved and mixed forests are expected to increase markedly. All investigated drivers have shown some effect, but land use is the dominant contributor to broad habitat change except for needle-leaved and mixed which are mainly influenced by climate change. Main conclusionsLand use is predicted to have the greatest effect on broad habitat distribution according to our simulations. Hence in most parts of Europe mitigating actions should focus on land-use change rather than climate change.

Oxygen saturation alone explained over one third of the deviation in the biomass developments in sheltered areas, while exposed areas were mainly limited by organic content of the sediments. We analyzed high-resolution climate-scenario simulations, following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios for the Baltic Sea region in combination with different nutrient load scenarios, for the end of the 21st century. The scenario outcomes showed negative trends in bottom oxygen concentrations throughout the coastal and archipelago zone along with overall increasing temperatures and primary production, and decreasing salinity. Our results suggest that these projected future conditions will strengthen the observed pattern in decreasing zoobenthic production in the immediate coastal zones. Moreover, the potential intensification of unfavorable conditions ex-panding seaward may lead to an expansion of biomass loss to more exposed sites.",0,2015,528,,141,159,10.3354/meps11279"Becker, PJJ; Reichert, S; Zahn, S; Hegelbach, J; Massemin, S; Keller, LF; Postma, E; Criscuolo, F; Criscuolo, O",Mother - offspring and nest-mate resemblance but no heritability in early-life telomere length in white-throated dippers,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,Article,relative telomere length; heritability; maternal effect; sex-linkage; inbreeding; bird,"Telomeres are protective DNA-protein complexes located at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, whose length has been shown to predict life-history parameters in various species. Although this suggests that telomere length is subject to natural selection, its evolutionary dynamics crucially depends on its heritability. Using pedigree data for a population of white-throated dippers (Cinclus cinclus), we test whether and how variation in early-life relative telomere length (RTL, measured as the number of telomeric repeats relative to a control gene using qPCR) is transmitted across generations. We disentangle the relative effects of genes and environment and test for sex-specific patterns of inheritance. There was strong and significant resemblance among offspring sharing the same nest and offspring of the same cohort. Furthermore, although offspring resemble their mother, and there is some indication for an effect of inbreeding, additive genetic variance and heritability are close to zero. We find no evidence for a role of either maternal imprinting or Z-linked inheritance in generating these patterns, suggesting they are due to non-genetic maternal and common environment effects instead.

However, their role in regulating the success of restorations is much less clear. This study assessed the ability of soil microbial communities to regulate the growth and performance of two potentially dominant grasses and two common forbs in tallgrass prairie restorations. Specifically, we examined the effects of soil microbial communities along a restoration chronosequence from agricultural fields to remnant prairies using experimentally inoculated soils. The two grass species, Andropogon gerardii and Sorghastrum nutans, grew best with the agricultural inoculates and experienced a decline in performance in later stages of the chronosequence, indicating that the microbial community shifted from being beneficial to grasses in the early stages to inhibiting grasses in the later stages of restoration. Growth of the forb, Silphium terebinthinaceum, varied little with inoculation or position along the restoration chronosequence. Growth of Baptisia leucantha, a legume, appeared limited by nodule formation in agricultural soils, peaked in young restoration soils along with nodule formation, but decreased in older soils as the microbial community became more antagonistic. Overall, negative feedbacks tended to be less important early in restoration, but appeared important in remnant and older restored prairies.

Exploitation barriers and the antagonist nature of mutualisms,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY,Article,Exploitation barriers; Plant-pollinator interaction; Optimal foraging; Resource partitioning; Competition; Mutualism; Antagonism,"The romantic perception of plant-animal mutualisms as a cooperative endeavour has been shattered in the last decades. While the classic theory of plant-pollinator coevolution assumed that partner coevolution is largely mutualistic, an increasing appreciation of the inherent conflict of interests between such partners has led to the realization that genes that confer a reproductive advantage to plants may have negative effects on their pollinators (and vice versa), giving rise to an apparent paradox: that antagonistic processes may drive coevolution among mutualistic partners. Under this new paradigm, mutualistic partners are bound by mutual interest but shaped by ""selfish"" antagonistic processes. Exploitation barriers mediated by resource competition among pollinators are a key element of this paradigm. Exploitation barriers involve traits such as tubular corollas, red flowers, toxic or deterrent rewards, and attractants of floral predators. Exploitation barriers result in resource partitioning, increasing floral fidelity of favoured pollinators and therefore plant fitness; but they often entail a physiological, behavioural or developmental cost for such favoured pollinators. Resource partitioning mediated by exploitation barriers is a very powerful driver of floral diversification, robust to variation in pollinator assemblages; hence, it may contribute to elucidating the occurrence of co-evolutionary changes in multi-species contexts. Exploitation barriers provide also a mechanistic basis for trait-based modelling of interaction networks, and represent a reason for caution in assuming fixed interaction identity or strength when modelling such networks (e.g. in rarefaction procedures used to estimate secondary extinctions). We propose to replace the misleading metaphor that depicts flowers and pollinators as cooperative partners by a metaphor in which plants and pollinator are traders, seeking to obtain different services from each other in complete disregard for the benefit of their mutualistic partner.",0,2015,29,3,311,322,10.1007/s10682-015-9757-8"Rollin, O; Bretagnolle, V; Fortel, L; Guilbaud, L; Henry, M","Habitat, spatial and temporal drivers of diversity patterns in a wild bee assemblage",BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,Article,Apoidea; Additive partitioning; Flowering habitats; Species richness; Species accumulation curve; Functional trait,"Across Europe conservation actions have been implemented to mitigate the decline of pollinators in agricultural landscapes. However, recent concerns have appeared about their efficiency to promote pollinator diversity. To increase the efficiency of these interventions, one must acquire a better knowledge of the target species diversity patterns and its sources of variations at different spatial and temporal scales. This study sets out to identify the main sources of variation in wild bee assemblages at a regional scale (450 km(2)) in mass-flowering crops and semi-natural habitats. During three consecutive sampling years, we monitored bee diversity and its temporal and spatial turnovers. We show that an intensive agricultural landscape in western France can hold nearly 200 wild bee species at a regional scale, i.e. 20 % of the whole bee fauna known in mainland France. Wild bee diversity was 3-4 times lower in oleaginous crops than in semi-natural habitats, with a substantial number of these being social and gregarious species. Spatial and seasonal species turnover in semi-natural habitats explained 28.6 and 34.3 %, respectively, of regional species richness. Given the importance of the spatial component of the bee diversity turnover, we suggest wild bee conservation efforts should be carried out at relevant spatial scales. The spatial turnover was estimated to be steeper within 50 km(2) scales.

We found temperature and CO2 interacted synergistically on overall predation rate, but antagonistically on predator selectivity. Notably, elevated CO2 or temperature alone reversed predator selectivity, but the interaction between the two stressors cancelled selectivity. Routine metabolic rates of the two prey showed strong species differences in tolerance to CO2 and not temperature, but these differences did not correlate with recorded mortality.

Agriculture affects streams and rivers worldwide, including via nutrient enrichment and increased fine sediment input. We manipulated nutrients (simulating agricultural run-off) and deposited fine sediment (simulating agricultural erosion) (two levels each) and water temperature (eight levels, 0-6 degrees C above ambient) simultaneously in 128 streamside mesocosms to determine the individual and combined effects of the three stressors on macroinvertebrate community dynamics (community composition and body size structure of benthic, drift and insect emergence assemblages). All three stressors had pervasive individual effects, but in combination often produced additive or antagonistic outcomes. Changes in benthic community composition showed a complex interplay among habitat quality (with or without sediment), resource availability (with or without nutrient enrichment) and the behavioural/physiological tendency to drift or emerge as temperature rose. The presence of sediment and raised temperature both resulted in a community of smaller organisms. Deposited fine sediment strongly increased the propensity to drift. Stressor effects were most prominent in the benthic assemblage, frequently reflected by opposite patterns in individuals quitting the benthos (in terms of their propensity to drift or emerge). Of particular importance is that community measures of stream health routinely used around the world (taxon richness, EPT richness and diversity) all showed complex three-way interactions, with either a consistently stronger temperature response or a reversal of its direction when one or both agricultural stressors were also in operation. The negative effects of added fine sediment, which were often stronger at raised temperatures, suggest that streams already impacted by high sediment loads may be further degraded under a warming climate.

LocationSouth-west Western Australia. MethodsA comprehensive survey of winter annual plant communities (more than a thousand communities sampled in total) was undertaken across a natural moisture availability gradient in phosphorus (P)-limited York gum woodlands exposed to different levels of anthropogenic P enrichment. Three key functional traits (height, seed mass and specific leaf area) were measured incorporating intraspecific variation. Community richness, dominance of exotic species and trait distributions were investigated along local nutrient and regional climate gradients using hierarchical linear models. Results were assessed against expectations of moisture-regulated release from nutrient limitation based on trade-off theories and experimental findings of synergistic water and nutrient effects. ResultsConsistent with theoretical expectations, we identified significant interactions between local P levels and regional moisture availability for many of the response variables examined. Specifically, in communities exposed to both high P and high moisture we found: (1) reduced species richness, (2) high dominance of exotic species, (3) increases in community mean trait values and (4) strongly narrowing trait ranges. These results are consistent with competitive exclusion (via light competition). In naturally low-P situations we also identified shifting trait distributions and narrowing ranges as moisture stress increased, a finding consistent with environmental filtering. Main conclusionIn this P- and water-limited system, plant community responses to P enrichment are contingent on regional moisture availability in a non-additive fashion. The most dramatic changes are seen under high-P and high-moisture conditions, i.e. where productivity is high and light has become a major limiting resource.

The endothermic salmon shark Lamna ditropis uses the California Current System (CCS) as a nursery area, though little is known about how juveniles use this ecosystem. Juvenile salmon sharks consistently strand along the west coast of North America. Strandings in the southern CCS occurred throughout the year, while those in the northern CCS were limited to summer and autumn, when mean sea surface temperatures were warmest. Strandings primarily occurred when water temperature was between 12 and 16 degrees C, suggesting that juveniles occupy a relatively narrow thermal niche. Stable isotope analysis (SIA) indicated that juveniles primarily feed on offshore meso-and epipelagic prey from the outer shelf, slope, and oceanic habitats as opposed to inshore and coastal habitats, although sharks appeared to move closer to shore prior to stranding. Generalized additive models indicate that the probability of stranding was greatest when mean water temperatures were relatively high (similar to 14 degrees C) and sharks were exposed to acute cold-water events (similar to 9 degrees C) during coastal upwelling.

Where human economic or recreational interests and wildlife share landscapes this problem is exacerbated. Changes in UK black grouse Tetrao tetrix populations are thought to have been strongly influenced by upland land use change. In a long-studied population within Perthshire, lek persistence is positively correlated with lek size, and remaining leks clustered most strongly within the landscape when the population is lowest, suggesting that there may be a demographic and/or spatial context to the reaction of the population to habitat changes. Hierarchical cluster analysis of lek locations revealed that patterns of lek occupancy when the population was declining were different to those during the later recovery period. Response curves from lek-habitat models developed using MaxEnt for periods with a declining population, low population, and recovering population were consistent across years for most habitat measures. We found evidence linking lek persistence with habitat quality changes and more leks which appeared between 1994 and 2008 were in improving habitat than those which disappeared during the same period. Generalised additive models identified changes in woodland and starting lek size as being important indicators of lek survival between declining and low/recovery periods. There may also have been a role for local densities in explaining recovery since the population low point.

While the effect of any one disturbance may be relatively well understood, multiple interacting disturbances can cause unexpected disturbance behavior (e.g., larger extents), altered return likelihoods, or reduced ecosystem resilience and regime shifts. Given the long-lasting implications of such events, and the potential for changes in disturbance rates driven by climate change and increasing anthropogenic pressures, developing a broad conceptual understanding and some predictive ability regarding the likelihood of interactions between disturbances is crucial. Through a broad synthesis of the literature, and across multiple biomes, disturbance interactions are placed into a unified framework around the concept of changing ecosystem resistance (""linked interactions,"" alterations to likelihood, extent, or severity) or ecosystem resilience (""compound interactions,"" alterations to recovery time or trajectory). Understanding and predicting disturbance interactions requires disaggregating disturbances into their constituent legacies, identifying the mechanisms which drive disturbances behavior (or ecosystem recovery), and determining when and where those mechanisms might be altered by the legacies of prior disturbances. The potential for cascading effects is discussed, by which these interactions may extend the reach of anthropogenic or climate change-induced alterations to disturbances beyond what is currently anticipated. Finally, several avenues for future research are outlined, as suggested from the current literature (and areas in which that literature is lacking). These include the potential for cross-scale interactions and changing scale-driven limitations, further work on cascading effects, and the potential for cross-biome comparisons.

However, the relationship between the community responses of soil microbes and variation in tree mixtures vs functional composition remains poorly understood. We investigated soil biochemical properties and soil microbial resistance and resilience to drought in three 4-year-old tree monocultures (Acer saccharum Marsh, Larix laricina (Duroi) K. Koch and Pinus strobus L.) and two tree species combinations (L.laricina/A.saccharum and L.laricina/P.strobus) planted in a high-density tree field experiment located in southern Quebec, Canada.

Microbial biomass was assessed immediately after the water stress (resistance) and 15 and 30days following drought (resilience). Results showed that tree communities influenced soil chemistry, soil respirometry properties and microbial resistance and resilience. We measured significant non-additive (i.e. both synergistic and antagonistic) effects of mixing tree species in some of the soil biochemical properties measured, mostly in the L.laricina/A.saccharum mixture. However, we did not find non-additive effects of tree mixtures on microbial resistance and resilience. A structural equation modelling analysis revealed that resistance and resilience were mostly modulated by direct effects of community-weighted means (CWM) of leaf litter lignin content and mineralizable N, and by indirect links from tree density and CWM of leaf litter N content via mineralizable N. This study suggests that tree species identity surpassed species mixtures as a key driver of soil microbial resistance and resilience.

Specifically, we do not know whether there are any mechanisms by which multicellularity can be maintained without a single-cell bottleneck or other relatedness-enhancing mechanisms. Under low relatedness, cheaters can evolve that benefit from the altruistic behaviour of others without themselves sacrificing. If these are obligate cheaters, incapable of cooperating, their spread can lead to the demise of multicellularity. One possibility, however, is that cooperators can evolve resistance to cheaters. We tested this idea in a facultatively multicellular social amoeba, Dictyostelium discoideum. This amoeba usually exists as a single cell but, when stressed, thousands of cells aggregate to form a multicellular organism in which some of the cells sacrifice for the good of others. We used lineages that had undergone experimental evolution at very low relatedness, during which time obligate cheaters evolved. Unlike earlier experiments, which found resistance to cheaters that were prevented from evolving, we competed cheaters and noncheaters that evolved together, and cheaters with their ancestors. We found that noncheaters can evolve resistance to cheating before cheating sweeps through the population and multicellularity is lost.

Here, we provide an overview of recent and potential future developments in macroecology that explore the role of antagonistic and mutualistic interactions among multiple species across trophic levels. Recent studies broadly represent two analytical methods (analyses of species richness and ecological networks) and provide evidence that plant-animal interactions (e.g. pollination, frugivory) and predator-prey interactions influence large-scale richness patterns and that ecological network structure varies systematically at macroscales. Current methodological problems and challenges are related to defining the functional links in cross-trophic richness analyses, understanding trait effects in multispecies interactions, and addressing sampling effects when analyzing multiple ecological networks across large spatial extents. Key topics for future research are 1) testing paleoclimatic imprints on interaction diversity, 2) understanding macroevolution and the phylogenetic structure of multispecies interactions, 3) quantifying contemporary spatial and temporal variability in complex ecological networks, and 4) predicting novel interactions under global change. Moreover, we see great potential for a deeper bidirectional integration of macroecology and network research, e.g. by analyses of trait complementarity and functional diversity of interacting groups and by employing species distribution modeling to predict changes in functional network structure.

The identification of synergism or antagonism is generally straightforward when stressors operate in the same direction, but if individual stressor effects oppose each other, the definition of synergism is paradoxical because what is synergistic to one stressor's effect direction is antagonistic to the others. In their highly cited meta-analysis, Crain et al. (Ecology Letters, 11, 2008: 1304) assumed insituations with opposing individual effects that synergy only occurs when the cumulative effect is more negative than the additive sum of the opposing individual effects. We argue against this and propose a new systematic classification based on an additive effects model that combines the magnitude and response direction of the cumulative effect and the interaction effect. A new class of mitigating synergism is identified, where cumulative effects are reversed and enhanced. We applied our directional classification to the dataset compiled by Crain etal. (Ecology Letters, 11, 2008: 1304) to determine the prevalence of synergistic, antagonistic, and additive interactions. Compared to their original analysis, we report differences in the representation of interaction classes by interaction type and we document examples of mitigating synergism, highlighting the importance of incorporating individual stressor effect directions in the determination of synergisms and antagonisms.

For seven months (during the rainy season), we sampled aquatic plants along transects in the pool and measured limnological parameters. The spatial structure of the community changed significantly over time. The input and permanence of species in the community varied according to the stage of flooding of the pool. This leads to the expectation that the species would have overlapping niches, causing interspecific competition to increase and exclude less efficient competitors. Indeed, we found that the species coexisting in the pool were only slightly phylogenetically related, an evidence of interspecific competition.

We identified the role of these interactions in determining reproductive output and invasion outcomes for species of Australian Acacia introduced to New Zealand. LocationAustralia and New Zealand. MethodsWe studied three species of Australian Acacia with different invasion success in New Zealand. In both Australia and New Zealand, we measured pollination success as the number of pods per inflorescence and the proportion of aborted seeds per pod, determined losses to pre-dispersal seed predators, and measured overall seed output. For each species, we compared performance in New Zealand with that in Australia, then examined whether there was any variation among species in their relative performance in each country. ResultsThe number of pods per inflorescence and proportion of seeds aborted were similar in each country and among species. There was little difference in pre-dispersal seed predation rate between Australia and New Zealand for Acacia dealbata, an invasive species, and Acacia baileyana, a species widely naturalized in New Zealand. However, pre-dispersal seed predation rate was lower in New Zealand for Acacia pravissima, currently considered to be a casual species there. Both the invasive A. dealbata and the casual A. pravissima produced more seeds per tree in New Zealand than Australia. Main conclusionsDifferences in reproductive success between the native and introduced range could not explain the differences in invasion success among the three Acacia species. Although per capita reproductive output was higher in New Zealand for two species, neither mutualistic interactions with pollinators nor antagonistic interactions with pre-dispersal seed predators explained those differences. The high seed output of A. pravissima suggests it has the potential to become invasive. These findings highlight the value of broad comparative studies in elucidating the drivers of invasion.",0,2015,42,4,619,629,10.1111/jbi.12455"Yang, GF; Ge, Y; Xue, H; Yang, W; Shi, Y; Peng, CH; Du, YY; Fan, X; Ren, Y; Chang, J",Using ecosystem service bundles to detect trade-offs and synergies across urban-rural complexes,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,Article,Driver; Geographic factors; Scaling; Socio-economic factors; Spatial pattern; Urbanization,"Understanding the relationships among ecosystem services is crucial for ecosystem-based management (EBM). In urbanized areas, improving human well-being increasingly depends on the services provided by human-dominated or artificial ecosystems. However, there is little understanding of the relationships among multiple ecosystem services of human-dominated ecosystems. Based on the methodology of ecosystem service bundles (sets of ecosystem services that repeatedly appear together), we conducted a case study in 22 urban-rural complexes across the Yangtze River Delta, the most developed area of China, to explore the spatial distributions, synergies, and trade-offs of multiple ecosystem services. Results showed that: (1) most of the selected ecosystem services were spatially clumped across the study area, and the distribution of ecosystem services contributes to the formation of scale effect in economy for the provision of services; (2) ecosystem service bundles aggregated spatially at the city cluster scale, implying the aggregate feature of bundles might be scale free; (3) trade-offs occurred mainly between landdependent services (such as crop production and water supply), while synergies occurred mainly between land-independent services (such as manufactured products and students of higher education), and there were no significant relationships between landdependent and land-independent services; (4) compared with geographic factors, socio-economic factors were the major drivers in the formation of ecosystem service bundles in the heavy urbanized region of the Yangtze River Delta. The study could improve the understanding of the relationships among multiple ecosystem services from local to regional scales. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This study quantified the separate and combined effects of low pH and low oxygen on 4 vital early life-history traits (time-to-hatch, hatching success, post-hatch survival, and growth) of 3 ecologically important estuarine fish species (Menidia beryllina, Menidia menidia, and Cyprinodon variegatus). Offspring were exposed from the egg through the early larval stages to ideal (pH(T) [pH total scale] = 7.9, DO [dissolved oxygen] = 9.0 mg l(-1)), hypoxic (DO = 1.6-2.5 mg l(-1)), acidified (pH(T) = 7.4), and hypoxic + acidified (pH(T) = 7.4, DO = 1.6-2.5 mg l(-1)) conditions. Hypoxia alone significantly delayed hatching of embryos by 1 to 3 d and reduced hatching success of all 3 species by 24 to 80%. Acidification alone significantly depressed the survival of M. beryllina. Acidification and hypoxia had an additive negative effect on survival of M. beryllina, a seasonal, synergistic negative effect on survival of M. menidia, and no effect on survival of C. variegatus. Acidification and hypoxia had an additive negative effect on length of larval M. beryllina, while hypoxia alone significantly reduced length of M. menidia and C. variegatus from 15 to 45%. Our findings suggest a greater sensitivity of early life estuarine fish to low oxygen compared to low pH conditions, while also demonstrating that the co-occurrence of both stressors can yield both additive and synergistic negative effects on survival and other fitness-related traits.

From field observations and a 5 wk kelp-thinning experiment that simulated disturbance, we found that snail density and grazing intensity on the kelp Saccharina latissima increased non-linearly with decreasing kelp biomass, as it varied within a site. Grazing intensity on S. latissima also increased non-linearly with decreasing standing kelp biomass across 5 sites spanning 40 km (linear distance) of coast and 2 yr, but we did not find strong support for this relationship for the kelp Laminaria digitata. Intensification of grazing augments the indirect effect of L. vincta on S. latissima (increased blade erosion and fragmentation), and drives it beyond a threshold for further losses of kelp biomass with subsequent storms. This positive feedback between large-scale disturbances and local-scale grazing could reinforce the depletion of kelp and facilitate the establishment of turf-forming algae on Nova Scotian rocky reefs.

Studies suggest that some ectotherms have a limited potential to change their upper thermal limits via evolutionary shifts, but research has mostly focused on adult life stages under laboratory conditions. Here we use replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster and a nested half-sib/full-sib quantitative genetic design to estimate heritabilities and genetic variance components for egg-to-adult viability under both laboratory and seminatural field conditions, encompassing cold, benign, and hot temperatures in two separate populations. The results demonstrated temperature-specific heritabilities and additive genetic variances for egg-to-adult viability. Heritabilities and genetic variances were higher under cold and benign compared to hot temperatures when tested under controlled laboratory conditions. Tendencies toward lower evolutionary potential at higher temperatures were also observed under seminatural conditions although the results were less clear in the field setting.

Climate warming is expected to affect water quality and facilitate turbidity in lakes, but we may also expect synergistic effects on organisms' interactions from climate and local specific dynamics in lakes. We here examined long-term changes in phytoplankton composition in July and August from 1980 to 2011 in a temperate shallow lake, Lake Krankesjon, a dataset including 21 years throughout a 31-year period. We hypothesize that although effects of the ongoing climate change are visible in our long-term data set, local specific dynamics override climate effects. We found that cyanophytes were the most abundant phytoplankton taxa among which small-sized colonial cyanobacteria were dominant. Both population density of small-sized colonial cyanobacteria and maximum water temperature increased over the period of study. However, the variations in the phytoplankton assembly were likely mainly related to three principal factors, including the local availability of nutrients, grazing from zooplankton, and possibly, an increasing trend in temperature. The first two factors are associated with the local specific dynamics, while the last with regional climate. Our long-term study showed that although there were potential climate warming effects on the phytoplankton community, local factors, such as biotic interactions and nutrient availability, were likely stronger drivers than climate warming in Lake Krankesjon at least over the last 30-year period.",0,2015,49,1,105,113,10.1007/s10452-015-9509-4"Khamis, K; Brown, LE; Hannah, DM; Milner, AM",Experimental evidence that predator range expansion modifies alpine stream community structure,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,Article,climate change; mesocosm; intraguild predation; Perla grandis; Pyrenees; food web; body size; enemy release,"Climate change is projected to facilitate altitudinal range expansions of lowland' taxa, creating novel species interactions. However, how range shifts will alter biotic interactions and community structure in alpine streams is not well understood. In the Pyrenees, climate-induced physicochemical habitat change is hypothesized to facilitate the colonization of high-altitude streams by Perla grandis, a carnivorous stonefly. A field-based experiment was conducted in mesocosm channels beside a hillslope spring (2000 m asl) in the Taillon-Gabietous catchment, French Pyrenees. The influence of P. grandis predation on community structure, feeding trait composition, body-size spectrum, and algal chlorophyll a concentration was examined. Gut contents were analyzed and used to identify consumed prey. Total invertebrate density was not significantly reduced by P. grandis, but Baetis spp. densities were depressed in the treatment channels through a combination of direct consumption and predator avoidance (emigration/drift). However, despite fewer grazers in the predator treatment channels, the magnitude of the trophic cascade effect on basal resources (measured as chlorophyll a density) was comparable between treatment and control channels. The results of this experiment suggest that size/species-specific predation, intraguild predation, and interference competition are the likely mechanisms that altered the body-size spectrum in treatment channels. In synergy with climate-driven physicochemical habitat change, the extinction risk of some range-restricted taxa (prey and other predators) could be increased where P. grandis colonization occurs. Hence, conservation efforts are required to ensure that additional anthropogenic stressors (e.g., nutrient enrichment, cattle trampling, hydropower development, ski runs, and tourism) are limited to minimize further pressures on these unique and sensitive habitats.",0,2015,34,1,66,80,10.1086/679484"Ruppert, JC; Harmoney, K; Henkin, Z; Snyman, HA; Sternberg, M; Willms, W; Linstadter, A","Quantifying drylands' drought resistance and recovery: the importance of drought intensity, dominant life history and grazing regime",GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Article,ANPP; climate change; drought; drylands; recovery; resilience; resistance; stability,"Projected global change will increase the level of land-use and environmental stressors such as drought and grazing, particularly in drylands. Still, combined effects of drought and grazing on plant production are poorly understood, thus hampering adequate projections and development of mitigation strategies. We used a large, cross-continental database consisting of 174 long-term datasets from >30 dryland regions to quantify ecosystem responses to drought and grazing with the ultimate goal to increase functional understanding in these responses. Two key aspects of ecosystem stability, resistance to and recovery after a drought, were evaluated based on standardized and normalized aboveground net primary production (ANPP) data. Drought intensity was quantified using the standardized precipitation index. We tested effects of drought intensity, grazing regime (grazed, ungrazed), biome (grassland, shrubland, savanna) or dominant life history (annual, perennial) of the herbaceous layer to assess the relative importance of these factors for ecosystem stability, and to identify predictable relationships between drought intensity and ecosystem resistance and recovery. We found that both components of ecosystem stability were better explained by dominant herbaceous life history than by biome. Increasing drought intensity (quasi-) linearly reduced ecosystem resistance. Even though annual and perennial systems showed the same response rate to increasing drought intensity, they differed in their general magnitude of resistance, with annual systems being ca. 27% less resistant. In contrast, systems with an herbaceous layer dominated by annuals had substantially higher postdrought recovery, particularly when grazed. Combined effects of drought and grazing were not merely additive but modulated by dominant life history of the herbaceous layer. To the best of our knowledge, our study established the first predictive, cross-continental model between drought intensity and drought-related relative losses in ANPP, and suggests that systems with an herbaceous layer dominated by annuals are more prone to ecosystem degradation under future global change regimes.",2,2015,21,3,1258,1270,10.1111/gcb.12777"Hill, PW; Garnett, MH; Farrar, J; Iqbal, Z; Khalid, M; Soleman, N; Jones, DL",Living roots magnify the response of soil organic carbon decomposition to temperature in temperate grassland,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Article,acclimation; carbon cycle; climate change; mineralisation; priming; soil organic matter; soil respiration; SOM,"Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration is both a strong driver of primary productivity and widely believed to be the principal cause of recent increases in global temperature. Soils are the largest store of the world's terrestrial C. Consequently, many investigations have attempted to mechanistically understand how microbial mineralisation of soil organic carbon (SOC) to CO2 will be affected by projected increases in temperature. Most have attempted this in the absence of plants as the flux of CO2 from root and rhizomicrobial respiration in intact plant-soil systems confounds interpretation of measurements. We compared the effect of a small increase in temperature on respiration from soils without recent plant C with the effect on intact grass swards. We found that for 48weeks, before acclimation occurred, an experimental 3 degrees C increase in sward temperature gave rise to a 50% increase in below ground respiration (ca. 0.4kg Cm-2; Q(10)=3.5), whereas mineralisation of older SOC without plants increased with a Q(10) of only 1.7 when subject to increases in ambient soil temperature. Subsequent C-14 dating of respired CO2 indicated that the presence of plants in swards more than doubled the effect of warming on the rate of mineralisation of SOC with an estimated mean C age of ca. 8years or older relative to incubated soils without recent plant inputs.

Because host-parasite interactions are so ubiquitous, it is of primary interest for ecologists to understand the factors that generate, maintain and constrain these associations. Phylogenetic comparative studies have found abundant evidence for host-switching to relatively unrelated hosts, sometimes related to diversification events, in a variety of host-parasite systems. For Monogenoidea (Platyhelminthes) parasites, it has been suggested that the co-speciation model alone cannot explain host occurrences, hence host-switching and/or non-vicariant modes of speciation should be associated with the origins and diversification of several monogenoid taxa. The factors that shape broad patterns of parasite sharing were investigated using path analysis as a way to generate hypotheses about the origins of host-parasite interactions between monogenoid gill parasites and Neotropical freshwater fishes. Parasite sharing was assessed from an interaction matrix, and explanatory variables included phylogenetic relationships, environmental preferences, biological traits and geographic distribution for each host species. Although geographic distribution of hosts and host ecology are important factors to understand host-parasite interactions, especially within host lineages that share a relatively recent evolutionary history, phylogeny had the strongest overall direct effect on parasite sharing. Phylogenetic contiguity of host communities may allow a stepping-stone' mode of host-switching, which increases parasite sharing.

Plasticity may be induced by either the mean or variance in conditions; however, plant responses to variance in the environment remain largely unquantified. We conducted a greenhouse experiment in northeastern Ohio using two congeneric pairs of perennial species in a design that crossed two soil heterogeneity and two light heterogeneity treatments. Nested within the soil heterogeneity treatment were patches of congener and conspecific origin, which tests the effects of possible plant-soil feedbacks on trait expression. We used plant biomass to measure performance and root:shoot ratio and specific leaf area (SLA) to measure resource acquisition and allocation. Plant biomass responded to the origin of the soil, consistent with the literature demonstrating that plant-soil feedbacks influence plant performance. Soil and light heterogeneity interacted to significantly affect resource acquisition traits (i.e., SLA) demonstrating that plants integrated both above- and belowground resource variance. All four species showed light-dependent, non-additive effects of soil mixture, though these effects were only marginally significant (P < 0.10). This is important in the context of community assembly because studies find the variance in environmental drivers to be as, or more, important than the means in determining community structure.

Despite the broad recognition of the importance of mycorrhizae for global carbon and nutrient cycling, we do not know how soil and climate variables relate to the intensity of colonization of plant roots by mycorrhizal fungi. Here we quantify the global patterns of these relationships. LocationGlobal. MethodsData on plant root colonization intensities by the two dominant types of mycorrhizal fungi world-wide, arbuscular (4887 plant species in 233 sites) and ectomycorrhizal fungi (125 plant species in 92 sites), were compiled from published studies. Data for climatic and soil factors were extracted from global datasets. For a given mycorrhizal type, we calculated at each site the mean root colonization intensity by mycorrhizal fungi across all potentially mycorrhizal plant species found at the site, and subjected these data to generalized additive model regression analysis with environmental factors as predictor variables. ResultsWe show for the first time that at the global scale the intensity of plant root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi strongly relates to warm-season temperature, frost periods and soil carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, and is highest at sites featuring continental climates with mild summers and a high availability of soil nitrogen. In contrast, the intensity of ectomycorrhizal infection in plant roots is related to soil acidity, soil carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and seasonality of precipitation, and is highest at sites with acidic soils and relatively constant precipitation levels. Main conclusionsWe provide the first quantitative global maps of intensity of mycorrhizal colonization based on environmental drivers, and suggest that environmental changes will affect distinct types of mycorrhizae differently.

However, knowledge of the interplay between OA and light availability is scarce. We exposed 2 calcifying coral reef species (the scleractinian coral Acropora millepora and the green alga Halimeda opuntia) to combinations of ambient and increased pCO(2) (427 and 1073 mu atm, respectively), and 2 light intensities (35 and 150 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) for 16 d. We evaluated the individual and combined effects of these 2 stressors on weight increase, calcification rates, O-2 fluxes and chlorophyll a content for the species investigated. Weight increase of A. millepora was significantly reduced by OA (48%) and low light intensity (96%) compared to controls. While OA did not affect coral calcification in the light, it decreased calcification in the dark by 155%, leading to dissolution of the skeleton. H. opuntia weight increase was not affected by OA, but decreased (40%) at low light. OA did not affect algae calcification in the light, but decreased calcification in the dark by 164%, leading to dissolution. Low light significantly reduced gross photosynthesis (56 and 57%), net photosynthesis (62 and 60%) and respiration (43 and 48%) of A. millepora and H. opuntia, respectively. In contrast to A. millepora, H. opuntia significantly increased chlorophyll content by 15% over the course of the experiment. No interactive effects of OA and low light intensity were found on any response variable for either organism. However, A. millepora exhibited additive effects of OA and low light, while H. opuntia was only affected by low light.

New approaches for understanding dynamic communities,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,Review,community phylogenetics; environmental gradients; geographic variation; plant succession; plant traits; propagule pressure; site history; soil biofeedbacks,"Succession has been a focus of extensive ecological study for well over a century. Despite this sustained interest, succession remains a central theme in ecological research and is positioned to continue that prominence in this era of expanding human impacts. Community ecology is currently experiencing a profound conceptual expansion, providing many new insights into succession. Here we present an existing conceptual framework of successional drivers that includes variation in site conditions, species availability and species performance, and expand it to include both evolutionary and geographic sources of variation. This framework is useful because it specifies relationships among individual drivers and is causally complete. While we generally think about succession as a within-site process, the inclusion of phylogenetic and geographic processes allows integration across broader scales. We use the conceptual framework to highlight several opportunities for successional research that have developed within community ecology, but have not been fully integrated into succession work. These ideas represent not only individual drivers of succession, but also potential synergistic processes operating through interaction with other drivers. The complexity of drivers in succession strongly argues for the need to move away from single factor studies towards combinatorial studies that incorporate multiple drivers. Utilizing a trait-based approach should allow researchers to address successional drivers at multiple ecological scales and lead to new insights that integrate ecological systems. Our ability to do this will depend on the availability of equivalent data across multiple systems, suggesting the need for more standardization in successional studies. Addressing the research opportunities highlighted here will not only produce insights into successional systems, but also expand our understanding of fundamental questions in community ecology as a whole. Of particular importance is the ability to address broader scale questions that go beyond the idiosyncrasies of individual sites and systems.

In this paper, we review the potential of the DISC coefficient for assessing plot-to-plot phylogenetic dissimilarity. First, the relationship between plot-to-plot dissimilarity and additive beta diversity is discussed. Next, we show that additive diversity decomposition can be interpreted in terms of a sum of classical Euclidean distances. Based on this geometrical interpretation of additive diversity decomposition, we then suggest an alternative way for calculating an analog of the DISC coefficient directly from the centroids of two species plots in multivariate phylogenetic space. The key to this method is that the centroids can be easily calculated by applying a principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) to the corresponding species phylogenetic distances. Finally, to show the potential of the DISC coefficient for analyzing the relationship between community structure and ecosystem functioning, we used the proposed measure by comparing phylogenetic and functional changes in plant communities along a primary succession on a glacier foreland in northern Italy. Our results show that changes in Grime's CSR functional classification of plant assemblages as competitors (C), stress-tolerators (S) and ruderals (R) along the successional gradient are also reflected in phylogenetic changes, indicating that species sorting by environmental filtering tends to favor the co-occurrence of phylogenetically related species.

We used an ecosystem modeling approach to investigate the independent and cumulative effects of fishing, marine protection, and ocean acidification on a coastal ecosystem. To quantify the effects of ocean acidification at the ecosystem level, we used information from the peer-reviewed literature on the effects of ocean acidification. Using an Ecopath with Ecosim ecosystem model for the Wellington south coast, including the Taputeranga Marine Reserve (MR), New Zealand, we predicted ecosystem responses under 4 scenarios: ocean acidification + fishing; ocean acidification + MR (no fishing); no ocean acidification + fishing; no ocean acidification + MR for the year 2050. Fishing had a larger effect on trophic group biomasses and trophic structure than ocean acidification, whereas the effects of ocean acidification were only large in the absence of fishing. Mortality by fishing had large, negative effects on trophic group biomasses. These effects were similar regardless of the presence of ocean acidification. Ocean acidification was predicted to indirectly benefit certain species in the MR scenario. This was because lobster (Jasus edwardsii) only recovered to 58% of the MR biomass in the ocean acidification + MR scenario, a situation that benefited the trophic groups lobsters prey on. Most trophic groups responded antagonistically to the interactive effects of ocean acidification and marine protection (46%; reduced response); however, many groups responded synergistically (33%; amplified response). Conservation and fisheries management strategies need to account for the reduced recovery potential of some exploited species under ocean acidification, nonadditive interactions of multiple factors, and indirect responses of species to ocean acidification caused by declines in calcareous predators.

Al usar un modelo de ecosistema Ecopath con Ecosim para la costa sur de Wellington, incluyendo la Reserva Marina Taputeranga (RM), Nueva Zelanda, pronosticamos las respuestas ambientales bajo cuatro escenarios: acidificacion oceanica + pesca; acidificacion oceanica + reservas marinas (RM) (sin pesca); ninguna acidificacion oceanica + pesca; ninguna acidificacion oceanica + RM para el ano 2050. La pesca tuvo un mayor efecto sobre la biomasa de los grupos troficos y sobre la estructura trofica que la acidificacion oceanica, mientras que los efectos de la acidificacion oceanica solo fueron mayores en la ausencia de la pesca. La mortandad por pesca tuvo efectos negativos mayores sobre la biomasa de los grupos troficos. Estos efectos fueron similares sin importar la presencia de la acidificacion oceanica. Se pronostico que la acidificacion oceanica beneficiaria indirectamente a ciertas especies en el escenario RM. Esto se debio a que la langosta (Jasus edwardsii) solo recuperaba hasta el 58% de la biomasa de la RM en el escenario de acidificacion oceanica + RM, una situacion que beneficio a los grupos troficos de los cuales se alimenta la langosta. La mayoria de los grupos troficos respondieron de manera antagonica a los efectos interactivos de la acidificacion oceanica y las reservas marinas (46% redujo su respuesta); sin embargo, muchos grupos respondieron de manera sinergica (33% amplio su respuesta). Las estrategias de conservacion y manejo de pesquerias necesitan responder por el potencial de recuperacion reducido de algunas especies explotadas bajo la acidificacion oceanica, las interacciones no aditivas de multiples factores y las respuestas indirectas de las especies a la acidificacion oceanica causada por la declinacion de depredadores calcareos.

Species tolerant to extremely harsh abiotic conditions (e.g. low pH or hypoxia) often have relatively small realised niches due to a trade-off between abiotic and biotic stress tolerance, and are therefore particularly vulnerable to extinction. We hypothesised that tolerance to multiple extreme conditions (e.g. low pH, hypoxia and drought) in brown mudfish Neochanna apoda, would increase their realised niche breadth because each extreme would provide additive refuge against a dominant species, the banded kokopu Galaxias fasciatus. Fish distributions were surveyed in 65 peat-swamp-forest streams and pools in New Zealand, which varied in dissolved oxygen, acidity and hydroperiod. Mudfish distribution was extremely patchy, and almost completely allopatric with kokopu. Allopatry was driven mainly by pool hydroperiod; mudfish occupied 88 percent of temporary pools due to their tolerance of habitat drying, whereas kokopu were absent from temporary pools. Within permanent pools, mudfish occurrence was negatively related to pool oxygen and pH, whereas kokopu occurrence was positively related to these conditions. Pool conditions were independently distributed in the landscape, suggesting that each abiotic stressor offered additive refuge for mudfish from kokopu predation/competition. Consequently, the mudfish realised niche breadth depended on the number of abiotic factors driving their allopatry with kokopu. Given the widespread negative relationships between niche breadth and species extinction probabilities, our results indicate that tolerance to multiple stressors may play an important role in insuring species persistence against the multiple drivers of global environmental change.",0,2015,38,2,154,162,10.1111/ecog.00526"Nepoux, V; Babin, A; Haag, C; Kawecki, TJ; Le Rouzic, A",Quantitative genetics of learning ability and resistance to stress in Drosophila melanogaster,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Article,Additive genetic variation; diallel crossing; Drosophila melanogaster; genetic correlation; learning,"Even though laboratory evolution experiments have demonstrated genetic variation for learning ability, we know little about the underlying genetic architecture and genetic relationships with other ecologically relevant traits. With a full diallel cross among twelve inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster originating from a natural population (0.75< F<0.93), we investigated the genetic architecture of olfactory learning ability and compared it to that for another behavioral trait (unconditional preference for odors), as well as three traits quantifying the ability to deal with environmental challenges: egg-to-adult survival and developmental rate on a low-quality food, and resistance to a bacterial pathogen. Substantial additive genetic variation was detected for each trait, highlighting their potential to evolve. Genetic effects contributed more than nongenetic parental effects to variation in traits measured at the adult stage: learning, odorant perception, and resistance to infection. In contrast, the two traits quantifying larval tolerance to low-quality food were more strongly affected by parental effects. We found no evidence for genetic correlations between traits, suggesting that these traits could evolve at least to some degree independently of one another.

Managing disturbance regimes and nutrient inputs may help maintain species diversity in such remnants. Yet, it is unclear the extent to which changes in resource availability due to reduced capture by resident plants and/or increased supply rates may trigger native community disassembly and exotic invasions. We examined how mowing disturbance and N fertilizer addition affected plant community recovery after a burning event in a remnant corridor of tussock pampa grassland in Argentina. The percentage cover and richness of native and exotic plant functional groups were monitored over 4years. According to the fluctuating resource theory', we expected invasion to be the highest when both light and N availability were increased simultaneously. Mowing delayed recovery by dominant C-4 tussock grasses and promoted subordinate, native C-3 grasses and exotic legumes, thus enhancing both native and exotic species richness. Fertilization induced a transient increase in native forbs but decreased total plant richness. Moreover, N addition to mowed grassland led to rapid invasion by short-lived exotic forbs, which were then replaced by exotic perennial grasses. Exotic grasses eventually spread across the grassland corridor, although at different rates depending on the treatment, and in parallel to a generalized decline in native species cover.Synthesis and applications. Community disassembly patterns reflected differential responses of native and exotic functional groups to altered resource supply rates. Synergisms between canopy disturbances and N enrichment posed the greatest threat to preserving a pampa grassland remnant prone to invasion. Establishing buffer zones may be required to enhance the viability of corridor-like grassland remnants in agricultural landscapes.

Pollination services are usually studied in isolation, and their relative role and possible interactions with other factors, such as major management practices, is little understood. We tested how pollination (insect vs. wind- and self-pollination) interacts with weed control, fertilization and insect herbivore control and how these factors as well as flower-visiting bees influence fruit set and yield of cucumber Cucumis sativus L. in 13 traditional Indonesian home gardens. Although insect pollination, fertilization and weed control additively increased crop yield, fertilization and weed control alone could not compensate for pollination loss. Pollination individually accounted for 75% of the yield and was, hence, the most important driver of yield. In contrast, herbivore control through insecticides at commonly applied levels did not increase yield. Yield strongly increased with higher number of flower-visiting bee individuals, while the number of bee individuals in turn was not influenced by weed control, fertilization or herbivore control, but increased with higher number of cucumber flowers.Synthesis and applications. Although multiple management practices influence yield, they cannot compensate yield gaps from pollinator loss in cucumber smallholder production in Indonesia. Our results also show that the widespread use of insecticides without considering the impacts on pest reduction is uneconomical.

This may reflect variation in limitation by different abiotic niche dimensions (realized niche shift) or phenotypic effects of biotic interactions that vary among ranges (realized niche expansion). Novel abiotic and biotic environments in the introduced range may also lead to genetic changes in exotic plant traits that enhance their abiotic stress tolerance (fundamental niche expansion). Here, we investigated how biotic interactions (aboveground herbivory and soil organisms) affect plant salinity tolerance using the invasive species Triadica sebifera from China (native range) and US (introduced range) populations grown in common gardens in both ranges. Simulated herbivory significantly reduced survival in saline treatments with reductions especially large at low salinity. Soil sterilization had a negative effect on survival at low salinity in China but had a positive effect on survival at low salinity in the US. Triadica survival and biomass were higher for US populations than for China populations, particularly in China but salinity tolerance did not depend on population origin. On average, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization was higher for US populations, US soils and low salinity. These factors had a significant, positive, non-additive interaction so that clipped seedlings from US populations in low saline US soils had high levels of AM colonization. Overall, our results show that phenotypic biotic interactions shape Triadica's salinity tolerance. Positive and negative biotic interactions together affected plant performance at intermediate stress levels. However, only aboveground damage consistently affected salinity tolerance, suggesting an important role for enemy release in expanding stress tolerance.",1,2015,124,2,216,224,10.1111/oik.01552"Camarero, JJ; Gazol, A; Galvan, JD; Sanguesa-Barreda, G; Gutierrez, E",Disparate effects of global-change drivers on mountain conifer forests: warming-induced growth enhancement in young trees vs. CO2 fertilization in old trees from wet sites,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Article,basal area increment; climate warming; dendroecology; generalized additive mixed models; Pinus uncinata; subalpine forests,"Theory predicts that the postindustrial rise in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere (c(a)) should enhance tree growth either through a direct fertilization effect or indirectly by improving water use efficiency in dry areas. However, this hypothesis has received little support in cold-limited and subalpine forests where positive growth responses to either rising c(a) or warmer temperatures are still under debate. In this study, we address this issue by analyzing an extensive dendrochronological network of high-elevation Pinus uncinata forests in Spain (28 sites, 544 trees) encompassing the whole biogeographical extent of the species. We determine if the basal area increment (BAI) trends are linked to climate warming and increased c(a) by focusing on region- and age-dependent responses. The largest improvement in BAI over the past six centuries occurred during the last 150years affecting young trees and being driven by recent warming. Indeed, most studied regions and age classes presented BAI patterns mainly controlled by temperature trends, while growing-season precipitation was only relevant in the driest sites. Growth enhancement was linked to rising c(a) in mature (151-300year-old trees) and old-mature trees (301-450year-old trees) from the wettest sites only. This finding implies that any potential fertilization effect of elevated c(a) on forest growth is contingent on tree features that vary with ontogeny and it depends on site conditions (for instance water availability). Furthermore, we found widespread growth decline in drought-prone sites probably indicating that the rise in c(a) did not compensate for the reduction in water availability. Thus, warming-triggered drought stress may become a more important direct driver of growth than rising c(a) in similar subalpine forests. We argue that broad approaches in biogeographical and temporal terms are required to adequately evaluate any effect of rising c(a) on forest growth.",0,2015,21,2,738,749,10.1111/gcb.12787"Myster, RW",Flooding x tree fall gap interactive effects on blackwater forest floristics and physical structure in the Peruvian Amazon,JOURNAL OF PLANT INTERACTIONS,Article,LTER; Peru; restinga; tahuampa,"To better understand how flooding and tree fall structure forests in the Amazon, I sampled vegetation plots within three blackwater forests (least flooded, medium flooded, highest flooded) and their tree fall gaps in the Peruvian Amazon.

Further among the stem size classes, only the smallest stems were significantly affected by openness and by type of forest, with a significant interaction term where flooding significantly decreased the number of these smaller stems in all forests and their gaps, except those with the highest level of flooding. Also tree fall gaps had significantly more, smaller stems than their forests in the two most-flooded forests, but not in the least-flooded forest.

Historically, mutualisms have been considered to be less important than antagonisms in affecting the composition of ecological communities. In plant communities, beneficial microbes may feature as keystone mutualists in structuring community composition. Understanding the direction and magnitude of mutualist effects at the community scale may be critical for making accurate predictions on plant responses to climate change, particularly for mutualists that ameliorate climate-induced stressors. Such mitigation could shift outcomes between mutualist-enhanced species diversity and mutualist-reduced diversity, depending on whether a mutualist accelerates habitat modification or competitive exclusion by its partner species. 2. Here, we tested the relative importance and interactive effects of altered precipitation and symbiosis between an epichloid fungal endophyte and a dominant grass species for dune plant communities along the Great Lakes, USA. In 2010, we imposed field manipulations of endophyte presence in the foundation dune grass Ammophila breviligulata in combination with rainout shelters and rainfall additions. We monitored natural rates of colonization by new plant individuals over 3 years. 3. Under the current precipitation regime, endophyte symbiosis in A. breviligulata reduced colonizing plant diversity, species richness and evenness. This effect depended on the amount of precipitation, with the symbiosis having weaker effects on plant diversity under both augmented and reduced rainfall treatments. 4. Despite the overall negative effect of endophyte symbiosis on plant diversity, plant responses to the endophyte were species specific. A federally threatened forb, Cirsium pitcheri, increased in abundance when the symbiosis was present, regardless of precipitation regime. Endophyte symbiosis in A. breviligulata caused minor reductions in the abundance of other grass species; however, augmented precipitation benefited other grasses. 5. Synthesis. We show that microbial mutualisms can have strong effects on community structure in a native ecosystem and that the amount of precipitation has the potential to alter how these keystone species interactions affect community composition.

This can affect primary and bacterial production as well as the commensalistic phytoplankton-bacteria relationship. The combined effects of UVR and reduction in the depth of the UML were assessed on variables related to the metabolism of phytoplankton and bacteria, during in situ experiments performed with natural pico- and nanoplankton communities from two oligotrophic lakes with contrasting UVR transparency (high-UVR versus low-UVR waters) of southern Spain. The negative UVR effects on epilimnetic primary production (PP) and on heterotrophic bacterial production (HBP), intensified under increased stratification, were higher in the low-UVR than in the high-UVR lake, and stronger on the phytoplanktonic than on the heterotrophic bacterial communities. Under UVR and increased stratification, the commensalistic phytoplankton-bacteria relationship was strengthened in the high-UVR lake where excretion of organic carbon (EOC) rates exceeded the bacterial carbon demand (BCD; i.e., BCD: EOC(%) ratio < 100). This did not occur in the low-UVR lake (i.e., BCD: EOC(%) ratio > 100). The greater UVR damage to phytoplankton and bacteria and the weakening of their commensalistic interaction found in the low-UVR lake indicates that these ecosystems would be especially vulnerable to UVR and increased stratification as stressors related to global climate change.

In six seashore mallow plantations, its well-developed perennial root system promoted the growth of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus in the rhizosphere, where the fungus's activity produced total glomalin (TG, ranging from 0.85 to 2.43 mg g(-1) soil), with a high ratio of TG/SOC (soil organic carbon) up to 53.29% in six-year-old seashore mallow plantation. K. virginica ameliorated the condition of saline soils, promoted native species growth, and increased plant diversity in the plantation sites. Seashore mallow contains many bioactive compounds, e.g., polysaccharides, saponins, flavonoids, etc. which have high bioactivity, and could be used as a fodder additive or for the development of health foods. The leaf, flower, stem and root of K. virginica, serve as raw materials for hierachical development of useful products according to their different properties. This study reviews and summarizes research on K. virginica in China during the past 20 years since its introduction from the USA. Also, we present guidelines for the planting and use of seashore mallow in China, in terms of an ecological engineering roadmap, which illustrates the process and strategy for the restoration of saline soils and designs for biomass industries based on its production.

Comparative analyses of the three transcriptomes indicated that the fungus reacted differently to each bacterial strain.

Despite concerns about the impacts of changes in land use, eutrophication and climate warming in running waters, the interactive effects of these stressors on stream periphyton are largely unknown. We manipulated nutrients (simulating agricultural runoff), deposited fine sediment (simulating agricultural erosion) (two levels each) and water temperature (eight levels, 0-6 degrees C above ambient) simultaneously in 128 streamside mesocosms. Our aim was to determine the individual and combined effects of the three stressors on the algal and bacterial constituents of the periphyton. All three stressors had pervasive individual effects, but in combination frequently produced synergisms at the population level and antagonisms at the community level. Depending on sediment and nutrient conditions, the effect of raised temperature frequently produced contrasting response patterns, with stronger or opposing effects when one or both stressors were augmented. Thus, warming tended to interact negatively with nutrients or sediment by weakening or reversing positive temperature effects or strengthening negative ones. Five classes of algal growth morphology were all affected in complex ways by raised temperature, suggesting that these measures may prove unreliable in biomonitoring programs in a warming climate. The evenness and diversity of the most abundant bacterial taxa increased with temperature at ambient but not with enriched nutrient levels, indicating that warming coupled with nutrient limitation may lead to a more evenly distributed bacterial community as temperatures rise.

Previous studies show that these environmental co-stressors significantly impact upon a number of key physiological functions, including calcification, metabolism and growth, in many marine organisms. Yet despite the importance of the immune system, to date only a handful of studies have investigated the impact of reduced seawater pH on an organism's immune response. Furthermore, whilst temperature has received far greater attention with respect to host defence, there is a dearth of information concerning the possible synergism of these two stressors on immune defence. Here we show that a 90 day exposure to reduced seawater pH led to a reduction in the antibacterial activity of cell-free haemolymph in the blue mussel Mytilus edulis, whilst temperature led to an increase in this immune parameter. However in contrast to previous research, following this initial 90 day exposure, mussels in the current study were then exposed to the pathogenic bacterium, Vibrio tubiashii. Crucially, whilst reduced seawater pH initially appeared to impair immunological functioning, as has been interpreted previously, mussels demonstrated the ability to restore haemolymph bactericidal activity when required. This indicated that the initial reduction in antibacterial activity was in fact a reversible physiological trade-off, rather than an irreversible impairment of immune function. By demonstrating this plasticity, the current study illustrates the need to measure organism responses within a realistic natural context (i.e. measuring the immune response of an organism in the presence of a pathogen). Failure to do so may result in a misleading interpretation of the ecological relevance of experimental data, and thus the sensitivity of different species in a rapidly changing environment.

However, to what extent resistance interacts with disturbance to control invasion success remains unclear. We studied the interaction between biotic resistance, fire and small-scale disturbances mimicking those of large mammalian herbivores (hoof action and grazing) on invasion success of the alien shrub Chromolaena odorata. LocationHluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, South Africa. MethodsWe performed a seedling transplant experiment in a savanna grassland. We manipulated the grass layer by clipping (grazing), created small-scale soil disturbances (hoof action) and transplanted seedlings under native tree canopies to assess potential nursing effects. Subsequently, we burned half of our plots. We assessed the effect of fire and small-scale disturbances on seedling growth, survival and biomass allocation. ResultsSeedling survival of C.odorata was 26% in undisturbed savanna grassland, reducing to 5% post-fire. Small-scale disturbances increased seedling biomass and survival and modified biomass allocation, whereas fire greatly reduced seedling survival. Root allocation increased in response to grass clipping, while stem allocation decreased. Tree shading increased seedling survival in the absence of fire, but greatly reduced post-fire survival. ConclusionsGrass communities in savannas exert a high level of biotic resistance to C.odorata invasion. However, small-scale disturbances, mimicking those of large mammalian herbivores, can facilitate the invasion of C.odorata in savanna grassland both directly, by creating micro-sites for establishment, and indirectly, by reducing the negative effect of fire.

Because resource C : N: P stoichiometry (i.e. the ratios of these key elements) exhibits strong control on consumers, we supposed that stoichiometric dissimilarity of litter mixtures (i.e. the divergence in C : N: P ratios among species) improves resource complementarity to decomposers leading to faster mixture decomposition. We tested this hypothesis with: (i) a wide range of leaf litter mixtures of neotropical tree species varying in C : N: P dissimilarity, and (ii) a nutrient addition experiment (C, N and P) to create stoichiometric similarity. Litter mixtures decomposed in the field using two different types of litterbags allowing or preventing access to soil fauna. Litter mixture mass loss was higher than expected from species decomposing singly, especially in presence of soil fauna. With fauna, synergistic litter mixture effects increased with increasing stoichiometric dissimilarity of litter mixtures and this positive relationship disappeared with fertilizer addition.

In contrast, the presence of a crab predator (Carcinus maenas) triggered few significant changes in gene expression in our experiment, and this response showed no significant overlap with the snail's response to thermal stress. These different gene expression profiles suggest that thermal stress and predation risk could pose distinct and potentially additive challenges for N.lapillus and that genetic responses to biotic stresses such as predation risk might be more complex and less uniform across species than genetic responses to abiotic stresses such as thermal stress.",2,2014,23,24,6104,6113,10.1111/mec.12994"Annala, M; Mykra, H; Tolkkinen, M; Kauppila, T; Muotka, T",Are biological communities in naturally unproductive streams resistant to additional anthropogenic stressors?,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,Article,benthic invertebrates; black shale; bryophytes; diatoms; forest drainage; multiple stressors; natural acidity; species richness; species turnover; streams,"Studies on the interactive responses to multiple simultaneously acting stressors have focused on individual or population-level responses in laboratory microcosms, while field-based studies on community-level responses are rare. We examined the influence of a natural (non-anthropogenic acidity) vs. human-induced stress (land drainage) and their interaction on species richness and spatial turnover ( diversity) of stream diatom, bryophyte, and benthic invertebrate communities. Our four stream categories were: circumneutral reference, circumneutral impacted, naturally acidic, and naturally acidic impacted streams. We expected the most sensitive species to be present only in the circumneutral reference streams. Therefore, species richness should be highest in these streams and lowest in the naturally acidic streams additionally stressed by forest drainage. Alternatively, communities in acidic streams may consist of the most tolerant taxa that are unaffected by further stressors, species richness in these streams remaining unaffected by drainage. We also expected spatial turnover to be highest in the circumneutral near-pristine streams and lowest in the drainage-impacted acidic streams. In all three taxonomic groups, diversity was lower in the naturally acidic than in circumneutral streams. The additional impact of the anthropogenic stress on species richness varied between groups, having no effect on diatoms, antagonistic effect on bryophytes, and additive effect on invertebrates. We also found differences in how each stressor modified diversity of each taxonomic group. For diatoms, diversity showed an overall tendency to decrease with increasing stress level, while bryophyte diversity responded mainly to forest drainage. Benthic invertebrate diversity did not differ between treatments. Our results suggest that non-additive effects among stressors need special attention to improve the understanding and management of multifactor responses in streams. Our results also argue for the primacy of a multi-taxon approach to environmental impact detection, and for the inclusion of a wide array of ecological responses, particularly community turnover, in bioassessment programs to detect responses that may go unnoticed by conventional richness-based measures.",1,2014,24,8,1887,1897,10.1890/13-2267.1"Anthelme, F; Gomez-Aparicio, L; Montufar, R",Nurse-based restoration of degraded tropical forests with tussock grasses: experimental support from the Andean cloud forest,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,Article,Ceroxylon echinulatum; competition; deforestation; facilitation; herbivory; plant-plant interactions; rehabilitation; Setaria sphacelata; stress-gradient hypothesis; tussock grass,"<list list-type=""1"" id=""jpe12311-list-0001""> The degradation of the Andean cloud forest raises strong biological conservation issues and threatens the sustainability of a crucial water resource. The idea that nurse-based restoration can accelerate the recovery of these forests is underexplored, despite its promise as a restoration technique. Recent conceptual models predict that facilitation among plants may be an important mechanism, but there is a lack of strong empirical support. We gathered experimental data to test this prediction and explore the relevance of using nurse-based forest restoration in these environments. A 20-month factorial experimental design in the Andean tropical cloud forest was established. We measured the survival and estimated the biomass production of transplanted seedlings of a keystone canopy forest species, Ceroxylon echinulatum (Arecaceae), in a deforested area in the presence/absence of herbivory, a potential nurse plant (the tussock grass Setaria sphacelata, Poaceae) and artificial shade. The joint effects of deforestation and herbivory led to the death of all seedlings, whereas most seedlings survived in the adjacent forest, which was used as the control. The presence of nurse plants led to significantly higher survival and growth of Ceroxylon seedlings throughout the experiment, regardless of herbivore presence. The nurse effects were explained by a reduction of the relative abiotic stress experienced by the seedlings outside the forest, that is, the consistently decreasing maximum vapour pressure deficit. Furthermore, nurse tussocks delayed and reduced the effects of herbivory by offering physical protection and a refuge for seedlings against detection by herbivores. However, the effects of herbivory and abiotic stress on facilitation were not additive.Synthesis and applications. Facilitation in degraded cloud forest can be intense as soon as the beneficiary plants are driven away from their physiological optimum (relative abiotic stress) and/or are confronted by herbivory. Using pre-established exotic tussock grasses as a nurse-based restoration technique in degraded cloud forest is a low-cost, non-detrimental (to biodiversity) option, especially in the absence of nurse trees and shrubs. The success of this method requires transplanting seedlings at the base of tussocks.

The 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets (Aichi Targets), which are included in the Strategic Plan, are organized under five Strategic Goals, and provide coherent guidance on how to achieve it. Halfway through the Strategic Plan, it is time to prioritize actions in order to achieve the best possible outcomes for the Aichi Targets in 2020. Actions to achieve one target may influence other targets (downstream interactions); in turn a target may be influenced by actions taken to attain other targets (upstream interactions). We explore the interactions among targets and the time-lags between implemented measures and desired outcomes to develop a framework that can reduce the overall burden associated with the implementation of the Strategic Plan. We identified the targets addressing the underlying drivers of biodiversity loss and the targets aimed at enhancing the implementation of the Strategic Plan as having the highest level of downstream interactions. Targets aimed at improving the status of biodiversity and safeguarding ecosystems followed by targets aimed at reducing the direct pressures on biodiversity and enhancing the benefits to all from biodiversity and ecosystem services, were identified as having the highest levels of upstream interactions. Perhaps one of the most challenging aspects of the Strategic Plan is the need to balance actions for its long-term sustainability with the need for urgent actions to halt biodiversity loss.

However, little work has been done to evaluate the specific effects of road networks and biodiversity loss beyond the more generalized effects of habitat loss. Here, we compared forest bird species richness and composition in the municipalities of Santarem and Belterra in Para state, eastern Brazilian Amazon, with a road network metric called 'roadless volume (RV)' at the scale of small hydrological catchments (averaging 3721 ha). We found a significant positive relationship between RV and both forest bird richness and the average number of unique species (species represented by a single record) recorded at each site. Forest bird community composition was also significantly affected by RV. Moreover, there was no significant correlation between RV and forest cover, suggesting that road networks may impact biodiversity independently of changes in forest cover. However, variance partitioning analysis indicated that RV has partially independent and therefore additive effects, suggesting that RV and forest cover are best used in a complementary manner to investigate changes in biodiversity. Road impacts on avian species richness and composition independent of habitat loss may result from road-dependent habitat disturbance and fragmentation effects that are not captured by total percentage habitat cover, such as selective logging, fire, hunting, traffic disturbance, edge effects and road-induced fragmentation.",1,2014,281,1795,,,10.1098/rspb.2014.1742"Lagator, M; Colegrave, N; Neve, P",Selection history and epistatic interactions impact dynamics of adaptation to novel environmental stresses,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,Article,environmental change; epistasis; pleiotropy; adaptation; evolutionary rescue; xenobiotics,"In rapidly changing environments, selection history may impact the dynamics of adaptation. Mutations selected in one environment may result in pleiotropic fitness trade-offs in subsequent novel environments, slowing the rates of adaptation. Epistatic interactions between mutations selected in sequential stressful environments may slow or accelerate subsequent rates of adaptation, depending on the nature of that interaction. We explored the dynamics of adaptation during sequential exposure to herbicides with different modes of action in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Evolution of resistance to two of the herbicides was largely independent of selection history. For carbetamide, previous adaptation to other herbicide modes of action positively impacted the likelihood of adaptation to this herbicide. Furthermore, while adaptation to all individual herbicides was associated with pleiotropic fitness costs in stress-free environments, we observed that accumulation of resistance mechanisms was accompanied by a reduction in overall fitness costs. We suggest that antagonistic epistasis may be a driving mechanism that enables populations to more readily adapt in novel environments. These findings highlight the potential for sequences of xenobiotics to facilitate the rapid evolution of multiple-drug and -pesticide resistance, as well as the potential for epistatic interactions between adaptive mutations to facilitate evolutionary rescue in rapidly changing environments.",0,2014,281,1794,,,10.1098/rspb.2014.1679"Castano-Villa, GJ; Ramos-Valencia, SA; Fonturbel, FE",Fine-scale habitat structure complexity determines insectivorous bird diversity in a tropical forest,ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Article,Basal area; Conservation; Foraging guild; Native forest plantation; Stem density,"Habitat complexity in reforested stands has been acknowledged as a key factor that influences habitat use by birds, being especially critical for habitat disturbance-sensitive species such as tropical understory insectivorous birds. Most studies regarding the relationship between forest structure and species diversity were conducted at the landscape scale, but different diversity patterns may emerge at a finer scale (i.e., within a habitat patch), We examined a tropical reforested area (State of Caldas, Colombia), hypothesizing that insectivorous bird richness, abundance, and foraging guild abundance would increase as intra-habitat complexity increases. We established 40 monitoring plots within a reforested area, measured their structural features, and determined their relationships with species richness, total abundance, and foraging guild abundance, using Generalized Additive Models. We found that the increasing variation in basal area, stem diameter, and number of stems was positively correlated with species richness, total abundance, and foraging guild abundance. Relationships between richness or abundance and structural features were not lineal, but showing curvilinear responses and thresholds. Our results show that heterogeneity on basal area, stem diameter, and the number of stems was more correlated to insectivorous bird richness and abundance than the average of those structural features. Promoting structural variation on reforested areas by planting species with different growth rates may contribute to increase the richness and abundance of a tropical vulnerable group of species such as the understory insectivorous birds.

Genetic diversity is a multiscalar variable; it includes heterozygosity at the individual scale, genotypic diversity at the population scale, and local adaptation at the regional scale. The three scales of genetic diversity are predominantly studied in isolation to determine conservation status or restoration potential. However, synergisms among the three scales should enhance conservation and restoration assessments. We studied 49 genotypes of Vallisneria americana, a common freshwater submersed aquatic macrophyte that has seen catastrophic declines in its estuarine habitats. Two greenhouse experiments examined phenotypic traits and trade-offs and the effects of genetic diversity on the sustainability of V. americana populations. Clone size, an exploitative guerilla strategy, and plant height, a conservative phalanx strategy, were negatively associated, as were average turion size with clone size and turion abundance, suggesting that growth strategies trade-off to affect plant fitness. Leaf size and turion size were lower in individuals with lower heterozygosity. Early clonal expansion and flowering frequency were enhanced when genotypic richness was higher. Coefficients of variation revealed that opportunities for selection differed across V. americana source beds. We demonstrate that the three scales of genetic diversity work together to determine population performance and evolutionary potential. Thus, integrating the three aspects of genetic diversity is paramount in addressing the impacts of a changing world on the conservation and restoration potential of at-risk populations.

The paper investigates synergetic potentials of multiple:criteria and multiple-perspective evaluation of agricultural activity through a study of the dairy sector in Slovenia. Socioeconomic and emergy evaluation was performed on nine farm types, formulated to represent the diversity of the country's dairy sector. The results indicate larger discrepancies in the performance of the farm types when defined by socio-economic or emergy based indicators. Standard socio-economic evaluation favours larger conventional systems that are cost efficient and financially independent. Emergy analysis however, favours less productive organic farms, which show greater ability to exploit free local resources and produce less stress on the local environment. Socio-economic and emergy indicators show that small conventional farm types are the poorest performers overall. Analysis of emergy flows reveals for all farm types a high dependency on the wider socio-economic system, suggesting that within the current economic system agriculture itself has little ability to affect its sustainability. The paper suggests a complementarity in the evaluation approaches. Their joint application can improve the quality of the decision-making process in various stages of planning in agriculture and land use.

Their inheritance is thus more likely through one of the two sexes, a property they share with sexually antagonistic alleles. Previous theory has shown that pairs of linked loci segregating for sexually antagonistic alleles are more likely to remain polymorphic and that linkage disequilibrium accrues between them. I probe this similarity between drive and sexual antagonism and examine the evolution of chromosomes experiencing these selection pressures simultaneously. Reminiscent of previous theory, I find that: the opportunity for polymorphism increases for a sexually antagonistic locus that is physically linked to a driving locus; the opportunity for polymorphism at a driving locus also increases when linked to a sexually antagonistic locus; and stable linkage disequilibrium accompanies any polymorphic equilibrium. Additionally, I find that drive at a linked locus favours the fixation of sexually antagonistic alleles that benefit the sex in which drive occurs. Further, I show that under certain conditions reduced recombination between these two loci is selectively favoured. These theoretical results provide clear, testable predictions about the nature of sexually antagonistic variation on driving chromosomes and have implications for the evolution of genomic architecture.",2,2014,27,11,2360,2370,10.1111/jeb.12493"Dmitriew, C; Blanckenhorn, WU",Condition dependence and the maintenance of genetic variance in a sexually dimorphic black scavenger fly,JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,Article,development time; genetic differentiation; genic capture; genotype by environment interactions; secondary sexual traits; Sepsis punctum; sexual dimorphism; sexual selection; size allometry,"The maintenance of genetic variation in traits under strong sexual selection is a longstanding problem in evolutionary biology. The genic capture model proposes that this problem can be explained by the evolution of condition dependence in exaggerated male traits. We tested the predictions that condition dependence should be more pronounced in male sexual traits and that genetic variance in expression of these traits should increase under stress as among-genotype variation in overall condition is exposed. Genetic variance in female and nonsexual traits should, by contrast, be similar across environments as a result of stabilizing selection on trait expression. The relationship between the degree of sexual dimorphism, condition dependence and additive genetic variance (V-a) was assessed for two morphological traits (body size and relative fore femur width) affecting male mating success in the black scavenger fly Sepsis punctum (Diptera: Sepsidae) and for development time (a nonsexual trait often correlated with body size). We compared trait expression between the sexes for two cross-continental populations that differ in degree of sexual dimorphism (Ottawa and Zurich). Condition dependence was indeed most pronounced in males of the strongly dimorphic Zurich population (males larger), and V-a was similar for males and females unless the trait was strongly sex specific and condition dependent. Contrary to prediction, however, V-a primarily increased under food limitation in both sexes, and genetic variance in fore femur width was low to nil, perhaps depleted by putatively strong sexual selection. Solely for body size of Zurich males, V-a increased more in males than females at limited food, in accordance with the predictions of the genic capture model.

We studied long-term changes (1980-2012) in forest dynamics and liana (woody vine) abundance and biomass in fragmented and intact forests of the central Amazon. We did so by contrasting trends in 33 permanent 1-ha plots near forest edges (plot center <100 m from the nearest edge) with those in 36 1-ha plots in intact-forest interiors (150-3300 m from nearest edge). In fragmented and edge-affected forests, rates of tree (>= 10 cm diameter at breast height) mortality and recruitment were often sharply elevated, especially in the first 10-15 years after fragmentation. Lianas (>2 cm stem diameter) also increased markedly in abundance (mean 6 SD = 1.78 +/- 1.23% per yr) and biomass (1.30 +/- 1.39% per yr) over time, especially in plots with high edge-related tree mortality. However, plots in undisturbed forest interiors, which were originally established as experimental controls, also experienced long-term changes. In these plots, tree mortality and recruitment rose significantly over time, as did liana abundance (1.00 +/- 0.88% per yr) and biomass (0.32 +/- 1.37% per yr). These changes were smaller in magnitude than those in fragments but were nonetheless concerted in nature and highly statistically significant. The causes of these changes in forest interiors are unknown, but are broadly consistent with those expected from rising atmospheric CO2 or regional climate drivers that influence forest dynamics. Hence, the dynamics of Amazonian forest fragments cannot be understood simply as a consequence of forest fragmentation. Rather, the changes we observed appear to arise from an interaction of fragmentation with one or more global-or regional-scale drivers affecting forest dynamics.

The evolutionary pressures determining plant allocation toward defense or competition are not well understood. According to the growth-differentiation balance hypothesis (GDB), the relative importance of herbivory and competition have led to the evolution of plant allocation patterns, with herbivore pressure leading to increased differentiated tissues (defensive traits), and competition pressure leading to resource investment towards cellular division and elongation (growth-related traits). Here, we tested the GDB hypothesis by assessing the competitive response of lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) plants with quantitatively different levels of cyanogenesis-a constitutive direct, nitrogen-based defense against herbivores. We used high (HC) and low cyanogenic (LC) genotypes in different competition treatments (intra-genotypic, inter-genotypic, interspecific), and in the presence or absence of insect herbivores (Mexican bean beetle, Epilachna varivestis) to quantify vegetative and generative plant parameters (above and belowground biomass as well as seed production). Highly defended HC-plants had significantly lower aboveground biomass and seed production than LC-plants when grown in the absence of herbivores implying significant intrinsic costs of plant cyanogenesis. However, the reduced performance of HC- compared to LC-plants was mitigated in the presence of herbivores. The two plant genotypes exhibited fundamentally different responses to various stresses (competition, herbivory).

Key to this understanding is identifying the mechanisms regulating vital rates. Determining the influence of density on survival is necessary to understand the extent to which human-caused mortality is compensatory or additive. In wolves (Canis lupus), empirical evidence for density-dependent survival is lacking. Dispersal is considered the principal way in which wolves adjust their numbers to prey supply or compensate for human exploitation. However, studies to date have primarily focused on exploited wolf populations, in which density-dependent mechanisms are likely weak due to artificially low wolf densities. Using 13years of data on 280 collared wolves in Yellowstone National Park, we assessed the effect of wolf density, prey abundance and population structure, as well as winter severity, on age-specific survival in two areas (prey-rich vs. prey-poor) of the national park. We further analysed cause-specific mortality and explored the factors driving intraspecific aggression in the prey-rich northern area of the park. Overall, survival rates decreased during the study. In northern Yellowstone, density dependence regulated adult survival through an increase in intraspecific aggression, independent of prey availability. In the interior of the park, adult survival was less variable and density-independent, despite reduced prey availability. There was no effect of prey population structure in northern Yellowstone, or of winter severity in either area. Survival was similar among yearlings and adults, but lower for adults older than 6years. Our results indicate that density-dependent intraspecific aggression is a major driver of adult wolf survival in northern Yellowstone, suggesting intrinsic density-dependent mechanisms have the potential to regulate wolf populations at high ungulate densities. When low prey availability or high removal rates maintain wolves at lower densities, limited inter-pack interactions may prevent density-dependent survival, consistent with our findings in the interior of the park.",3,2014,83,6,1344,1356,10.1111/1365-2656.12238"Prill, N; Bullock, JM; van Dam, NM; Leimu, R",Loss of heterosis and family-dependent inbreeding depression in plant performance and resistance against multiple herbivores under drought stress,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Article,environment dependence; evolutionary ecology; habitat fragmentation; outbreeding depression; plant defence; plant-herbivore interactions; secondary metabolites,"Inbreeding depression (ID), outbreeding depression (OD) and heterosis can occur concurrently in plant populations. ID often increases under environmental stress, but the combined effects of inbreeding, outbreeding between populations and environmental stress, such as drought, on plant performance and herbivore resistance remain unclear. In order to determine environment-dependent and family-dependent ID, OD and heterosis, we conducted a common garden experiment with plants from five populations of Brassica nigra. Inbred, within-population outbred and between-population outbred plant families were exposed to drought or ambient water levels. We recorded the abundance and damage caused by specialist herbivores from contrasting feeding guilds, that is the phloem-feeding Brevicoryne brassicae, the leaf-chewing Psylliodes chrysocephalus and the stem-boring Ceutorhynchus quadridens larvae. Drought stress had negative effects on growth, herbivore resistance and resistance against B.brassicae and positive effects on investments in reproductive output and plant secondary metabolites (sinigrin). We found drought stress-induced loss of heterosis for plant height and investment in reproductive output. Between-population outbred plants were more sensitive to drought stress in terms of above-ground biomass compared to within-population outbred plants. Drought and inbreeding synergistically negatively influenced traits related to growth and reproductive output (environment-dependent inbreeding depression, EDID). There was high variation among families within populations in the degree of ID and EDID. Genetic variation in EDID could buffer the negative effects of genetic stress associated with habitat fragmentation and concurrent environmental stress. In order to capture fully the effects of both inbreeding and between-population outbreeding under stress, the different spatial scales of the effects of inbreeding and between-population outbreeding should be taken into account.Synthesis. Our results indicate that drought stress influences not only inbreeding depression (ID), but also heterosis.

The interaction of stressors from such events has the potential to amplify negative impacts and drive ecosystems into alternate states. Here, we show a drastic response of a temperate seagrass species (Amphibolis antarctica) in Shark Bay - a World Heritage Site in Western Australia at a temperate-tropical transition zone - to two stressors driven by concurrent extreme climatic events: a marine heatwave (Ningaloo Nina) and the Gascoyne floods that impacted the west coast of Australia in the austral summer of 2010-2011. Widespread defoliation (leaf loss) of A.antarctica was observed in the months following the extreme events and was highest at sites affected by flooding (Wooramel River floods). We propose that the negative impact was magnified by the synergistic interactions both stressors had on the carbon balance of the plant. The elevated temperatures increased plant demand for carbon, which could not be met through photosynthesis due to turbid floodwaters reducing light availability, resulting in the plant having a negative carbon balance. Two years following the extreme events, recovery of leaf biomass was evident, though still 7-20% of historical averages. In contrast, below-ground biomass decreased by an order of magnitude in the two years following the events. As below-ground reserves underpin the tolerance of large seagrass species like A.antarctica to disturbances, the declining trajectory of below-ground biomass will likely manifest as a loss of resilience in A. antarctica to future disturbances.Synthesis. Given the ecological importance of Amphibolis antarctica in Shark Bay as a foundation species - accounting for 85% (3700km(2)) of the cover of seagrasses in Shark Bay - predicted increases in the frequency and magnitude of similar climatic events could have catastrophic implications for the future of this World Heritage embayment.

As the oceans warm and decrease in pH due to increased anthropogenic CO2 production(,) coral reefs are also susceptible to bleaching, disease and reduced calcification. The impacts of ocean acidification and warming may be exacerbated by COTS predation, but it is not known how this major predator will fare in a changing ocean. Because larval success is a key driver of population outbreaks, we investigated the sensitivities of larval A. planci to increased temperature (2-4 degrees C above ambient) and acidification (0.3-0.5 pH units below ambient) in flow-through cross-factorial experiments (3 temperaturex3 pH/pCO(2) levels). There was no effect of increased temperature or acidification on fertilization or very early development. Larvae reared in the optimal temperature (28 degrees C) were the largest across all pH treatments. Development to advanced larva was negatively affected by the high temperature treatment (30 degrees C) and by both experimental pH levels (pH 7.6, 7.8). Thus, planktonic life stages of A. planci may be negatively impacted by near-future global change. Increased temperature and reduced pH had an additive negative effect on reducing larval size. The 30 degrees C treatment exceeded larval tolerance regardless of pH. As 30 degrees C sea surface temperatures may become the norm in low latitude tropical regions, poleward migration of A. planci may be expected as they follow optimal isotherms.

Temperature is a major driver of Mg incorporation into the skeletons of calcifying macroalgae, and thus climate change may induce deposition of more soluble calcite, exacerbating responses to OA. Assessment of the skeletal Mg content of 3 geniculate, calcifying species of the genera Corallina and Ellisolandia (Rhodophyta, Corallinales), C. officinalis, C. caespitosa and E. elongata, sampled during 2012-2013 in the UK intertidal, demonstrated the existence of seasonal cycles in skeletal Mg. Seasonal cycles in skeletal Mg were also observed for herbarium collections of the Natural History Museum (British Museum), London, sampled during the recent past (1850-2010). Comparative sampling across a northeastern Atlantic latitudinal transect (Iceland to northern Spain) indicated a decreasing Mg content with increasing latitude for present-day C. officinalis, and relationships between SST and Corallina Mg content (r(2) = 0.45-0.76) demonstrated the dominant influence of temperature on Corallina species skeletal mineralogy. Corallina and Ellisolandia species show lower absolute values of Mg content (0.11-0.16 mol% Mg/Ca), and smaller variation with change in SST (0.0028-0.0047 mol% Mg/Ca degrees C-1), than other temperate calcifying macroalgae studied to date. Over the period 1850-2010, no change in the magnitude of Mg incorporation by C. officinalis was detected in herbarium samples. However, the strong relationship between SST and Mg content indicates that projected increases in SST by 2100, which are far greater than temperature increases that occurred between 1850-2010, could have substantial impact on geniculate coralline algae skeletal mineralogy, and must be considered synergistically with the effects of OA.",0,2014,513,,71,84,10.3354/meps10929"Alva-Basurto, JC; Arias-Gonzalez, JE",Modelling the effects of climate change on a Caribbean coral reef food web,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,Article,Mesoamerican coral reef; Climate change; Increased sea temperature; Deoxygenation; Acidification; Trophic web dynamics,"Global climate change and local anthropogenic pressures are among the primary factors leading to the decline of functional biodiversity and critical habitats in coral reefs. Coral bleaching, the potential decreases in dissolved oxygen concentration (deoxygenation) and pH (acidification) in the oceans can induce severe changes in coral reef ecosystem biodiversity and functionality. The main objective of this study was to apply four Ecopath with Ecosim models of a Caribbean coral reef system to individually and collectively model the effects of coral bleaching on the trophic web, deoxygenation on fish, and acidification on calcifying organisms. These three sources of stress were used as forcing functions on several trophic groups depending on the model. The forcing functions were scaled according to the species' responses achieved in previously tested climate change marine models. For the bleaching model, a mediation function was also considered that represents the degree of coral reef protection on small and intermediate fish groups. The dynamic models were constructed from an extensive database of 171 reef fish species (abundance and biomass) and benthic communities from 13 coral reefs that were evenly distributed parallel to approximately 400 km of the Mexican Caribbean coast as well as fishery landings in this area. Simulations driven with these different forcing and mediation functions predicted different changes in the biomasses of fish and non-fish functional groups as well as the biomass of the functional groups of fished species. Coral bleaching and pH reduction caused a phase shift to a decrease in coral biomass and an increase in primary producer biomass. This shift produced a cascading decrease in the biomass of small and intermediate fish groups. Additionally, the fished functional group biomass increased with coral bleaching but decreased with the effects of decreased oxygen on fish and pH on calcifying organisms. The biomasses of certain macroinvertebrate functional groups were predicted to respond favourably to the combined effect of the sources of stress. However, when all the sources of stress were combined, we found a general decrease of biomass in fish, non-fish, and some commercially valuable fish and macroinvertebrate functional groups, suggesting that the combined effects of stress induced synergistic effects as a result of global climate change and overfishing, which can result in a potential loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services in coral reefs.

We report the severe impact of a previously undocumented introduced predator on the endangered, migratory swift parrot (Lathamus discolor). Sugar gliders (Petaurus breviceps), a supposedly benign introduced species, were detected acting as a major opportunistic predator of cavity-nesting birds. We assessed the intensity and geographical extent of sugar glider predation and investigated whether habitat loss exacerbated predation risk to swift parrots. Location Tasmania, Australia. Methods We monitored nests of swift parrots for 3 years with motion-activated cameras. We used bioclimatic modelling to predict the potential distribution of introduced sugar gliders across the study area and assessed the predation risk to swift parrots and other threatened birds in the region using nest-survival analysis. Results Daily survival of nests in areas where sugar gliders occurred was mean 0.97, which equated to a true likelihood of 0.17 for a nest to survive the 60-day nesting period. No nests failed on an offshore island where sugar gliders were shown to be absent. Most cases (83.3%) of glider predation resulted in the death of the adult female parrot. On the Tasmanian mainland, there was a positive relationship between nest survival and increasing mature forest cover at the landscape scale. Main conclusions Predation risk varied dramatically across the breeding range of swift parrots, depending on the presence of sugar gliders. Offshore islands are an important refuge for swift parrots because sugar gliders are absent. However, islands are vulnerable, and our bioclimatic model shows that they are bioclimatically suitable for sugar gliders. Synergistic interactions between predation and habitat loss combine with low breeding-site philopatry to expose swift parrots to dramatic variation in predation risk depending on nesting location.",3,2014,20,10,1200,1207,10.1111/ddi.12214"Cartwright, SJ; Nicoll, MAC; Jones, CG; Tatayah, V; Norris, K",Agriculture modifies the seasonal decline of breeding success in a tropical wild bird population,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,Article,anthropogenic habitat; coupled effect; model system; phenology; prey; raptor; reintroduced; reproduction; spatio-temporal synergy,"1. Habitat conversion for agriculture is a major driver of biodiversity loss, but our understanding of the demographic processes involved remains poor. We typically investigate the impacts of agriculture in isolation even though populations are likely to experience multiple, concurrent changes in the environment (e. g. land and climate change). Drivers of environmental change may interact to affect demography, but the mechanisms have yet to be explored fully in wild populations. 2. Here, we investigate the mechanisms linking agricultural land use with breeding success using long-term data for the formerly Critically Endangered Mauritius kestrel Falco punctatus, a tropical forest specialist that also occupies agricultural habitats. We specifically focused on the relationship between breeding success, agriculture and the timing of breeding because the latter is sensitive to changes in climatic conditions (spring rainfall) and enables us to explore the interactive effects of different (land and climate) drivers of environmental change. 3. Breeding success, measured as egg survival to fledging, declines seasonally in this population, but we found that the rate of this decline became increasingly rapid as the area of agriculture around a nest site increased. If the relationship between breeding success and agriculture was used in isolation to estimate the demographic impact of agriculture, it would significantly under-estimate breeding success in dry (early) springs and over-estimate breeding success in wet (late) springs. 4. Analysis of prey delivered to nests suggests that the relationship between breeding success and agriculture might be due, in part, to spatial variation in the availability of native, arboreal geckos. 5. Synthesis and applications. Agriculture modifies the seasonal decline in breeding success in this population. As springs are becoming wetter in our study area and since the kestrels breed later in wetter springs, the impact of agriculture on breeding success will become worse over time. Our results suggest that forest restoration designed to reduce the detrimental impacts of agriculture on breeding may also help reduce the detrimental effects of breeding late due to wetter springs. Our results therefore highlight the importance of considering the interactive effects of environmental change when managing wild populations.",0,2014,51,5,1387,1395,10.1111/1365-2664.12310"Santora, JA; Schroeder, ID; Field, JC; Wells, BK; Sydeman, WJ",Spatio-temporal dynamics of ocean conditions and forage taxa reveal regional structuring of seabird-prey relationships,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,Article,anchovy; demographic response; ecosystem oceanography; forage fish; krill; management; preyscape; seabird reproduction; seascape; upwelling,"Studies of predator prey demographic responses and the physical drivers of such relationships are rare, yet essential for predicting future changes in the structure and dynamics of marine ecosystems. Here, we hypothesize that predator prey relationships vary spatially in association with underlying physical ocean conditions, leading to observable changes in demographic rates, such as reproduction. To test this hypothesis, we quantified spatio-temporal variability in hydrographic conditions, krill, and forage fish to model predator (seabird) demographic responses over 18 years (1990-2007). We used principal component analysis and spatial correlation maps to assess coherence among ocean conditions, krill, and forage fish, and generalized additive models to quantify interannual variability in seabird breeding success relative to prey abundance. The first principal component of four hydrographic measurements yielded an index that partitioned ""warm/weak upwelling"" and ""cool/strong upwelling"" years. Partitioning of krill and forage fish time series among shelf and oceanic regions yielded spatially explicit indicators of prey availability. Krill abundance within the oceanic region was remarkably consistent between years, whereas krill over the shelf showed marked interannual fluctuations in relation to ocean conditions. Anchovy abundance varied on the shelf, and was greater in years of strong stratification, weak upwelling and warmer temperatures. Spatio-temporal variability of juvenile forage fish co-varied strongly with each other and with krill, but was weakly correlated with hydrographic conditions. Demographic responses between seabirds and prey availability revealed spatially variable associations indicative of the dynamic nature of ""predator habitat"" relationships.

Functional diversity (FD) of pollinators can increase plant reproductive output and the stability of plant-pollinator communities. Yet, in times of world-wide pollinator declines, effects of global change on pollinator FD remain poorly understood. Loss of natural habitat and exotic plant invasions are two major drivers of global change that particularly threaten pollinator diversity. 2. In a subtropical South African landscape, we investigated changes in the FD of flower visitor assemblages on native and exotic plants along gradients of natural habitat loss and relative abundance of exotic plants. We used a data set of 1434 flower visitor individuals sampled on 131 focal plants and calculated the FD in three flower visitor traits that are strongly related to plant-flower visitor interactions and pollination processes: proboscis length, proboscis diameter and body length. 3. Multivariate FD of flower visitors decreased with both increasing natural habitat loss and relative exotic abundance. Importantly, changes in FD went beyond those in flower visitor richness. Furthermore, flower visitor richness was not related to either natural habitat loss or relative exotic abundance. Loss in multivariate FD seemed to be mediated by complementary reductions of FD in proboscis length with natural habitat loss and of FD in body length with both global change drivers. Correspondingly, we recorded lower abundances of long-tongued flower visitors with natural habitat loss and reduced variance in body size with both drivers. In contrast, FD in proboscis diameter was unaffected by either driver. All effects of the two global change drivers were non-interactive. 4. Our results show that both natural habitat loss and exotic plants negatively affect flower visitor FD, which may imperil pollination of specialized plant species in degraded habitats. In contrast, flower visitor richness may not cover all facets of flower visitor FD that are relevant to pollination processes. Distinct responses of visitor traits to the two drivers suggest limited options to infer relations of one trait to another.

The investigation of microbe-microbe interactions is essential for understanding the in vivo activities of commensal and pathogenic microorganisms. Candida albicans, a polymorphic fungus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative bacterium, are two opportunistic pathogens that interact in various polymicrobial infections in humans. To determine how P. aeruginosa affects the physiology of C. albicans and vice versa, we compared the proteomes of each species in mixed biofilms versus single-species biofilms. In addition, extracellular proteins were analyzed. We observed that, in mixed biofilms, both species showed differential expression of virulence proteins, multidrug resistance-associated proteins, proteases and cell defense, stress and iron-regulated proteins. Furthermore, in mixed biofilms, both species displayed an increase in mutability compared with monospecific biofilms. This characteristic was correlated with the downregulation of enzymes conferring protection against DNA oxidation. In mixed biofilms, P. aeruginosa regulates its production of various molecules involved in quorum sensing and induces the production of virulence factors (pyoverdine, rhamnolipids and pyocyanin), which are major contributors to the ability of this bacterium to cause disease.

This paper develops an approach that integrates scientific knowledge and stakeholders' demands to provide decision-making guidelines for the development of new landscape planning strategies while considering ecosystem services. First, a participatory process was conducted to develop a community vision for the region's sustainable future considering the opportunities and constrains provided by the landscape and its ecosystems. In the participatory process forest management was considered an important driver for the region`s landscape development and forest multi-functionality was envisioned as a feasible attractive alternative. The participatory process identified a knowledge gap on the synergies and trade-offs between biodiversity and carbon storage and how these depend on different forest types. Second, to study the existing synergies and trade-offs between biodiversity and carbon storage and disentangle the identified knowledge gap, a GIS-based research was conducted based on spatially explicit indicators. Our spatial analysis results showed that natural forests' contribution to biodiversity and carbon storage is higher than that of the plantations with exotic species in the region. The results from the spatial analysis converged with those from the participatory process in the suitability of promoting, where possible and appropriate, natural forest ecosystems restoration.

In this context, synergistic effects between predation risk and other natural stressors on prey organisms are gaining attention. Although non-pathogenic bacteria can be widespread in aquatic ecosystems, their role in mediating effects of predation risk has been ignored. We here address the hypothesis that non-pathogenic bacteria may reinforce the negative effects of predation risk in larvae of the damselfly Coenagrion puella. We found synergistic effects for all three life history variables studied: mortality increased, growth reductions were magnified and bacterial load was higher when both non-lethal stressors were combined. The combined exposure to the bacterium and predation risk considerably impaired the two key antipredator mechanisms of the damselfly larvae: they no longer reduced their food intake under predation risk and showed a synergistic reduction in escape swimming speed. The reinforcing negative effects on the fitness-related traits could be explained by the observed synergistic effects on food intake, swimming muscle mass, immune function and oxidative damage. These are likely widespread consequences of energetic constraints and increased metabolic rates associated with the fight-or-flight response. We therefore hypothesize that the here documented synergistic interactions with non-pathogenic bacteria may be widespread.

Moreover, body size displayed a seasonal cycle, with larger individuals occurring mainly in winter months. This seasonality matches the annual reproductive cycle of the species.

Savannas are highly heterogeneous tree-grass mixtures, and the structural variation imposed by a discontinuous canopy cover results in spatial variation in soil properties such as plant-available nutrients, temperature and soil moisture. Many savannas are also dominated by large vertebrate herbivores, which impose a different suite of effects on soil properties related to consumption, excretion and physical disturbance. 2. In nutrient-poor, water-limited systems, variation in soil resource availability may play a fundamental role in structuring plant communities, but the relative and interactive effects of key drivers of heterogeneity have received little attention in savanna ecosystems. 3. We investigated the independent and interactive effects of herbivores and tree canopy cover on multiple soil properties up to a depth of 10 cm, including bulk density, soil C pools, total and plant-available nutrients, moisture dynamics and temperature at two contrasting sites in Kruger National Park, South Africa. We analysed samples from locations under and between adult tree canopies and inside and outside long-term herbivore exclosures using a nested design. 4. We found strong positive effects of tree canopies on total and labile pools of soil C and N and negative effects on plant-available P and soil temperature. Tree canopy effects on soil moisture availability were small but clearly detectable. During precipitation events, trees increased moisture inputs on granite soils but decreased moisture inputs on basalt soils compared to open sites. 5. Conversely, we found mixed evidence for herbivore effects on soil chemistry and temperature, but a clearer effect on soil moisture, with areas outside exclosures experiencing higher soil moisture retention, particularly immediately following precipitation events. Soil bulk density, a driver of both nutrient and soil moisture dynamics, was lower under trees and when herbivores were excluded. 6. Synthesis.

We used a daily mechanistic ecosystem model to generate 40-yr outputs using observed climatic data for scenarios of decreased precipitation (25-100%); increased ail. temperature (1 degrees-6 degrees C); simultaneous changes in both precipitation (+/-50%, +/-25%) and air temperature (+1 to +6 degrees C) and increased interannual variability (IAV) of precipitation (+1 sigma to +3 sigma, with fixed means, where a is SD). We fitted model output from these scenarios to Huxman et al.'s RUEmAx bioclimatic model, NPP = alpha + RUE X PPT (where alpha is the intercept, RUE is rain use efficiency, and PPT is annual precipitation). Based on these analyses, we conclude that there is strong support (when not explicit, then trend-wise) for Huxman et al.'s assertion that biomes converge to a common RUEmAx during the driest years at a site, thus representing the boundary for highest rain use efficiency; the interactive effects of simultaneously decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature on NPP for the TP is smaller than might be expected from additive, single-factor changes in these drivers; and that increasing IAV. of precipitation may ultimately have a larger impact on biomes of the Tibetan Plateau than changing amounts of rainfall and air temperature alone.",0,2014,95,8,2109,2120,"Castorani, MCN; Hovel, KA; Williams, SL; Baskett, ML",Disturbance facilitates the coexistence of antagonistic ecosystem engineers in California estuaries,ECOLOGY,Article,antagonism; bioturbation; competition; disturbance; ecosystem engineering; eelgrass; estuary; ghost shrimp; habitat modification; Neotrypaea californiensis; sediment biogeochemistry; Zostera marina,"Ecological theory predicts that interactions between antagonistic ecosystem engineers can lead to local competitive exclusion, but disturbance can facilitate broader coexistence. However, few empirical studies have tested the potential for disturbance to mediate competition between engineers. We examined the capacity for disturbance and habitat modification to explain the disjunct distributions of two benthic ecosystem engineers, eelgrass Zostera marina and the burrowing ghost shrimp Neotrypaea californiensis, in two California estuaries. Sediment sampling in eelgrass and ghost shrimp patches revealed that ghost shrimp change benthic biogeochemistry over small scales (centimeters) but not patch scales (meters to tens of meters), suggesting a limited capacity for sediment modification to explain species distributions. To determine the relative competitive abilities of engineers, we conducted reciprocal transplantations of ghost shrimp and eelgrass. Local ghost shrimp densities declined rapidly following the addition of eelgrass, and transplanted eelgrass expanded laterally into the surrounding ghost shrimp-dominated areas. When transplanted into eelgrass patches, ghost shrimp failed to persist. Ghost shrimp were also displaced from plots with structural mimics of eelgrass rhizomes and roots, suggesting that autogenic habitat modification by eelgrass is an important mechanism determining ghost shrimp distributions. However, ghost shrimp were able to rapidly colonize experimental disturbances to eelgrass patch edges, which are common in shallow estuaries. We conclude that coexistence in this system is maintained by spatiotemporally asynchronous disturbances and a competition colonization trade-off: eelgrass is a competitively superior ecosystem engineer, but benthic disturbances permit the coexistence of ghost shrimp at the landscape scale by modulating the availability of space.",1,2014,95,8,2277,2288,"Mattila, ALK; Hanski, I",Heritability of flight and resting metabolic rates in the Glanville fritillary butterfly,JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,Article,animal model; butterfly flight; dispersal; flight metabolic rate; heritability; insect flight; maternal effect; resting metabolic rate,"Dispersal capacity is a key life-history trait especially in species inhabiting fragmented landscapes. Evolutionary models predict that, given sufficient heritable variation, dispersal rate responds to natural selection imposed by habitat loss and fragmentation. Here, we estimate phenotypic variance components and heritability of flight and resting metabolic rates (RMRs) in an ecological model species, the Glanville fritillary butterfly, in which flight metabolic rate (FMR) is known to correlate strongly with dispersal rate. We modelled a two-generation pedigree with the animal model to distinguish additive genetic variance from maternal and common environmental effects. The results show that FMR is significantly heritable, with additive genetic variance accounting for about 40% of total phenotypic variance; thus, FMR has the potential to respond to selection on dispersal capacity. Maternal influences on flight metabolism were negligible. Heritability of flight metabolism was context dependent, as in stressful thermal conditions, environmentally induced variation dominated over additive genetic effects. There was no heritability in RMR, which was instead strongly influenced by maternal effects.

Plants in estuarine environments experience large variations in both on a seasonal basis and exceptionally warm summers have caused massive die-backs of eelgrass in many areas. We investigated experimentally how different combinations of salinity and temperature affect the physiological performance of adult eelgrass (Zostera marina) shoots and seedlings. Plants were exposed to different combinations of salinity (salinity 5, 12.5 and 20) and temperature (15,20 and 25 degrees C) in a 5-week aquarium experiment. Plants responded in general negatively to decreasing salinity and increasing temperature and the combination of high temperature and low salinity resulted in markedly higher mortality rates and lower leaf production when compared to plants held at more optimal combinations of salinity and temperature. Seedlings had higher absolute mortality, while adult shoots were relatively more sensitive to unfavorable levels of salinity. Leaf tissue sucrose concentrations in both life stages decreased at low salinity, whereas salinity and temperature resulted in contrasting starch concentrations between seedlings and adult shoots. Our results show that altered salinity and temperature may have negative synergistic effects on eelgrass performance. Future climate changes may thus have serious impacts on eelgrass survival and performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Global environmental change drivers can act simultaneously to impact the abundance and diversity of biota, but few studies have also measured the impact across trophic levels. We firstly investigated whether climate (using temperature differences across a latitudinal gradient as a surrogate) interacts with habitat fragmentation (measured according to fragment area and distance to habitat edges) to impact a New Zealand tri-trophic food chain (plant, herbivore and natural enemy). Secondly, we examined how these interactions might differentially impact both the density and biotic processes of species at each of the three trophic levels. We found evidence to suggest that these drivers act non-additively across trophic levels. The nature of these interactions however varied: location synergistically interacted with fragmentation measures to exacerbate the detrimental effects on consumer density; and antagonistically interacted to ameliorate the impact on plant density and on the interactions between trophic levels (herbivory and parasitoid attack rate).

Some Trichoderma isolates can directly affect plant pathogens, but they also are known to influence the phytohormonal network of their host plant, thus leading to an improvement of plant growth and stress tolerance. In this study, we tested whether alterations in the phytohormone signature induced by different Trichoderma isolates correspond with their ability for biocontrol and growth promotion. Four Trichoderma isolates were collected from agricultural soils and were identified as the species Trichoderma harzianum (two isolates), Trichoderma ghanense, and Trichoderma hamatum. Their antagonistic activity against the plant pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. melonis was tested in vitro, and their plant growth-promoting and biocontrol activity against Fusarium wilt on melon plants was examined in vivo, and compared to that of the commercial strain T. harzianum T-22. Several growth- and defense-related phytohormones were analyzed in the shoots of plants that were root-colonized by the different Trichoderma isolates. An increase in auxin and a decrease in cytokinins and abscisic acid content were induced by the isolates that promoted the plant growth. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to evaluate the relationship between the plant phenotypic and hormonal variables. PCA pointed to a strong association of auxin induction with plant growth stimulation by Trichoderma. Furthermore, the disease-protectant ability of the Trichoderma strains against F. oxysporum infection seems to be more related to their induced alterations in the content of the hormones abscisic acid, ethylene, and the cytokinin trans-zeatin riboside than to the in vitro antagonism activity against F. oxysporum.",1,2014,40,7,804,815,10.1007/s10886-014-0478-1"Shantz, AA; Burkepile, DE",Context-dependent effects of nutrient loading on the coral-algal mutualism,ECOLOGY,Article,coral growth; coral reefs; eutrophication; nutrients; photobiology; Symbiodinium; symbiosis,"Human-mediated increases in nutrient availability alter patterns of primary production, impact species diversity, and threaten ecosystem function. Nutrients can also alter community structure by disrupting the relationships between nutrient-sharing mutualists that form the foundation of communities. Given their oligotrophic nature and the dependence of reef-building corals on symbiotic relationships, coral reefs may be particularly vulnerable to excess nutrients. However, individual studies suggest complex, even contradictory, relationships among nutrient availability, coral physiology, and coral growth. Here, we used meta-analysis to establish general patterns of the impact of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) on coral growth and photobiology. Overall, we found that over a wide range of concentrations, N reduced coral calcification 11%, on average, but enhanced metrics of coral photobiology, such as photosynthetic rate. In contrast, P enrichment increased average calcification rates by 9%, likely through direct impacts on the calcification process, but minimally impacted coral photobiology. There were few synergistic impacts of combined N and P on corals, as the nutrients impact corals via different pathways. Additionally, the response of corals to increasing nutrient availability was context dependent, varying with coral taxa and morphology, enrichment source, and nutrient identity. For example, naturally occurring enrichment from fish excretion increased coral growth, while human-mediated enrichment tended to decrease coral growth.

The inherent complexity of nature produces a diverse and varied set of outcomes for any given ecological process.

Among the synthesis tools available for this specific purpose, meta-analysis is one of the most accurate and powerful methods. 2. This Special Feature examines the use that meta-analysis has received in plant ecology over the last two decades and provides examples of synthesis applied to contemporary topics in different areas of plant ecology from populations to ecosystems. 3. The number of meta-analyses in plant ecology has been increasing rapidly in the last two decades. However, this increase has not been accompanied by a parallel increase in quality. The opening review paper in this Special Feature provides a checklist of quality criteria specific to ecological meta-analysis that will largely contribute to improvement of the methodological and reporting standards of meta-analyses. 4. The following five papers in the Special Feature demonstrate the advantages of application of meta-analysis compared with other techniques of research synthesis. Meta-analysis is applied here to demonstrate the consistency of ecological hypotheses across large spatial scales (e.g. Janzen-Connell hypothesis), understand sources of variation in the magnitude of ecological processes (e.g. herbivory effects on leaf life span, effects of intraspecific genetic diversity on communities and ecosystems), measure synergistic impacts of environmental change drivers (e.g. CO2, drought, land use) or assess research gaps within a certain sub-discipline of plant ecology (e.g. landscape fragmentation). 5. Synthesis. Meta-analysis can contribute to the advance of ecological theory by synthesizing the available evidence on specific topics and informing the scope of generalizations.

We examine how these changes affect carbon storage and stability compared to historic fire-adapted conditions. We modeled carbon dynamics under possible drought and fire conditions over a 300-year simulation period in two mixed-conifer conditions common in the western United States: (1) pine-dominated with an active fire regime and (2) fir-dominated, fire suppressed forests. Fir-dominated stands, with higher live- and dead-wood density, had much lower carbon stability as drought and fire frequency increased compared to pine-dominated forest. Carbon instability resulted from species (i.e., fir's greater susceptibility to drought and fire) and stand (i.e., high density of smaller trees) conditions that develop in the absence of active management. Our modeling suggests restoring historic species composition and active fire regimes can significantly increase carbon stability in fire-suppressed, mixed-conifer forests.

We demonstrate that an increased SOS stress response within mature biofilms induces SOS-dependent colicin R expression. We provide evidence that colicin R displays increased activity against E. coli strains that have a reduced lipopolysaccharide length, such as the pathogenic enteroaggregative E. coli LF82 clinical isolate, therefore pointing to lipopolysaccharide size as an important determinant for resistance to colicins. We show that colicin R toxicity toward E. coli LF82 is increased under biofilm conditions compared with planktonic susceptibility and that release of colicin R confers a strong competitive advantage in mixed biofilms by rapidly outcompeting sensitive neighboring bacteria. This work identifies the first biofilm-associated colicin that preferentially targets biofilm bacteria.

We mechanistically studied the interaction between the sediment-stabilizing seagrass Zostera noltii and the bioturbating and sediment-destabilizing lugworm Arenicola marina, which sometimes co-occur for prolonged periods. We investigated (1) if the negative sediment destabilization effect of A. marina on Z. noltii might be counteracted by positive biogeochemical effects of bioirrigation (burrow flushing) by A. marina in sulfide-rich sediments, and (2) if previously observed nutrient release by A. marina bioirrigation could affect seagrasses.

However, studies on parental effects typically suffer from the problems that heritabilities and maternal environmental effects are difficult to separate, and that both may depend on environmental factors and developmental stage. In order to experimentally disentangle maternal from paternal contributions and the likely effects of developmental stage from ecological effects, we sampled a natural population of the whitefish Coregonus palaea, used gametes for full-factorial in vitro fertilizations, raised over 10000 of the resulting offspring singly at controlled conditions, and exposed them at different points during embryonic development to one of two strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens that differed in their virulence characteristics (only one caused mortality, while both delayed hatching and reduced growth). Vulnerability to infection increased markedly over embryo development. This change coincided with a distinct shift in the importance of maternal to additive genetic effects on survival. Timing of exposure also affected the variance components for hatching time and larval length, but in a less consistent direction than the variance components for mortality. No significant genetic variation was found for any reaction norms across time points of exposure, indicating a uniformity among genotypes in how susceptibility changed over development. Phenotypes were also typically correlated across time points, which could constrain the evolution of the reaction norms.

Local disturbance and environmental attributes of the forest (e.g. fire severity, litter abundance, canopy openness, vegetation structure) and adjacent landscape matrix (e.g. cover of forest, urban and agricultural land) were measured in detail at each site. Results Invasion was associated with substantial local extinctions of native plant species (i.e. 83% fewer species in invaded sites), altered community compositions and an 85% reduction in rates of woody plant recruitment. Local disturbances and environmental attributes of forest stands and adjacent landscape matrix were similar between invaded and native sites. Invasion caused a twofold increase in litter biomass, which we hypothesize is the primary mechanism by which the invader excludes native species. Landscape modification had no effect on the diversity of adjacent swamp forest. There was no interactive effect of landscape modification and invasion on the native community; species losses in response to invasion were high regardless of the condition of the adjacent matrix.

We apply this novel approach to a turtle species inhabiting wetlands which are patchily distributed across a tropical savannah, and whose persistence is threatened by two important synergistic drivers of global change: predation by invasive species and over-exploitation. We show that projections of local range dynamics in this study system change substantially when functional connectivity is modelled explicitly. Accounting for functional connectivity in model simulations causes the estimate of extinction risk to increase, and predictions of range contraction to slow.

Using new survey data from 74 streams, we showed that habitat size and disturbance were the most important stressors influencing predator body size. A synergistic interaction between that habitat size and disturbance due to flooding meant the sizes of predatory fishes peaked in large, benign habitats and their body size decreased as habitats became either smaller or harsher. These patterns were supported by experiments indicating that habitat-size reductions and increased flood disturbance decreased both the abundance and biomass of large predators. This research indicates that interacting climate change stressors can influence predator body size, resulting in smaller predators than would be predicted from examining an environmental factor in isolation.

Location Hawai'i Experimental Tropical Forest (HETF), a tropical montane wet forest, on Mauna Kea, Hawai'i Island, Hawai'i, USA. Methods Previous studies employing airborne LiDAR were used to define three zones across an elevation gradient from 900 to 1500m. Within each zone, a ~1000-m block transect was selected to cross two different volcanic substrates: one derived from surface lava and one derived from thick ash deposits. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) scores of vegetation data were related to independently-derived environmental NMS scores and spatial location with generalized additive models (GAM). Results Vascular plant species composition in all elevation zones consists of three NMS axes, which are best modelled by one of three possible environmental NMS axes or by location. The first NMS axis of species composition in the lowest elevation zone (40% variance explained (VE)) is a function of location on volcanic substrates (61% deviance explained (DE)). The second lowest elevation axis (27% VE) is a function of unexplained spatial heterogeneity (31% DE). The third lowest elevation NMS axis (24% VE) is a function of the spatial mosaic of canopy disturbance (16% DE). In the middle elevation zone, species composition most strongly relates to the interaction between volcanic substrate and the condition of the soil surface for all three NMS axes (41%, 27%, 24% VE; 70%, 16%, 24% DE). The primary axis of species composition in the highest elevation zone (41% VE) corresponds with substrate and soil condition (55% DE) but the second and third axes of species composition (27% and 25% VE) relate to canopy dieback disturbance (36%, 14% DE). Counts of exotic species and 0-2m height class native tree species respond to the type of volcanic substrate and soil surface condition in all three elevation zones. Lava-derived substrates have a higher incidence of exotic species and less native tree regeneration; whereas ash-derived substrates have higher numbers of native tree species regenerating and many fewer exotic species. Discussion The tropical montane forests on Mauna Kea reflect a native-dominated plant community response to disturbance on both lava- and ash-derived volcanic substrates, and a higher propensity for exotic species to occur on the lava-derived substrate. Native plant communities on ash-derived soils may have higher resilience to exotic invasion than communities on lava-derived substrates. Our results indicate resource managers should explicitly account for variation in soils and substrate type when prioritizing, implementing and monitoring management interventions to foster native plant assemblages and control the spread of exotic and invasive species.",1,2014,25,3,734,749,10.1111/jvs.12112"Qadri, M; Rajput, R; Abdin, MZ; Vishwakarma, RA; Riyaz-Ul-Hassan, S","Diversity, Molecular Phylogeny, and Bioactive Potential of Fungal Endophytes Associated with the Himalayan Blue Pine (Pinus wallichiana)",MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,Article,,"In this study, we investigated the diversity of fungal endophytes associated with Pinus wallichiana from the Western Himalayas, with emphasis on comparison of endophytic communities harbored by the stem and needle tissues of the host and their antimicrobial potential. A total number of 130 isolates, comprising of 38 different genera, were recovered from 210 fragments of the plant. Among the isolated fungi, only a single isolate, Tritirachium oryzae, belonged to the Phylum Basidiomycota whereas the rest belonged to Ascomycota. Dothideomycetes was the dominant class with the highest isolation frequency of 49.2 %. The most frequent colonizers of the host were Alternaria spp., Pestalotiopsis spp., Preussia spp., and Sclerostagonospora spp. The diversity and species richness were higher in needle tissues than in the stems. Antimicrobial activities were displayed by extracts from a total number of 22 endophytes against one or more pathogens. Endophytes designated as P1N13 (Coniothyrium carteri), P2N8 (Thielavia subthermophila), P4S6b (Truncatella betulae), P7N10 (Cochliobolus australiensis), and P8S4 (Tritirachium oryzae) were highly active against Candida albicans. Broad spectrum antimicrobial activities were obtained with the extracts of P8-S4 (Tritirachium oryzae) and P5-N26 (Coniochaeta gigantospora) that were potentially active against the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as the fungal pathogen, Candida albicans. The most prominent antagonistic activity against fungal pathogens was shown by P8-S4 (Tritirachium oryzae), P5-N31a (Truncatella spadicea), and P5-N20 (Fusarium larvarum).

Over the following winter recruitment season, Ecklonia recruitment was unaffected by increased nutrients alone, but tripled at all sites where the canopy had been removed. At one site, the combination of disturbance and increased nutrients resulted in more than four times the recruitment of the introduced kelp Undaria pinnatifida. Six months after disturbance, the proliferation of the Undaria canopy in the canopy-removal and nutrient-addition treatment negatively influenced the recovery of the native kelp Ecklonia.

Both lead to a loss of biodiversity and alter species interactions, which may imperil vital ecosystem processes such as seed dispersal by frugivores. Reponses of frugivores to disturbance are often linked to their specialization on certain habitats or resources. Yet, it is poorly understood how habitat loss and plant invasion structure interactions between plants and different habitat or feeding guilds. Here we investigated whether visitation rates of frugivores change guild-specifically with increasing habitat loss and invasion level in a heterogeneous subtropical landscape. In 756 h of observations, we recorded 1446 plant-frugivore interactions among 18 plant species and 42 avian frugivore species. Visitation rates of forest specialists decreased with increasing habitat loss, but not with changes in invasion level. In contrast forest generalists and forest visitors were unaffected by either driver. Similarly, obligate frugivores that overall showed a generalized fruit choice were unaffected by habitat loss and changes in invasion level. Contrary, visitation rates of specialized partial and opportunistic frugivores decreased with higher invasion level. Importantly, the negative effect of plant invasion on partial frugivores was more pronounced as habitat loss in the same study site increased, indicating a synergistic effect of the two drivers. The implications of our study are twofold: first, frugivores respond guild-specifically to habitat loss and plant invasion. Thereby forest dependency is mainly related to habitat loss, and degree of frugivory mainly related to plant invasion. Forest generalists and obligate frugivores in turn may play a key-role for forest regeneration in disturbed forest landscapes.

Impacts can be caused by local stressors which can be managed, such as eutrophication, and by global stressors that cannot be managed, such as climate change. Cumulative impact maps typically assume that there are no interactive effects between stressors on biodiversity. However, the benefits of managing the ecosystem are affected by interactions between stressors. Our aim was to determine whether the assumption of no interactions in impact maps leads to incorrect identification of sites for management. Location General, Australasia. Methods We used the additive effects model to incorporate the effects of interactions into an interactive impact map. Seagrass meadows in Australasia threatened by a local stressor, nutrient inputs, and a global stressor, warming, were used as a case study. The reduction in the impact index was quantified for reductions in the nutrient stressor. We examined the outcomes for three scenarios: no interactions, antagonistic interactions or synergistic interactions. Results Cumulative impact maps imply that reducing a local stressor will give equivalent reductions in the impact index everywhere, regardless of spatial variability in a global stressor. We show that reductions in the impact index were greatest in refuges from warming if there was an antagonistic interaction between stressors, and greatest in areas of high warming stress if there was a synergistic interaction. Reducing the nutrient stressor in refuges from warming always reduced the impact index, regardless of the interaction. Main conclusions Interactions between local and global stressors should be considered when using cumulative impact maps to identify sites where management of a local stressor will provide the greatest impact reduction.

Both predators and parasites can affect host traits, such as growth rates and behavior, and these effects may in part be mediated through shared physiological pathways (e.g. the glucocorticoid stress hormone, corticosterone [CORT]). Here, we examined the effects of trematode parasites (Digena: Echinostomatidae) and predator (larval odonate) exposure on larvae of two amphibian species (Rana sylvatica and R. clamitans) in laboratory experiments. First, we measured behavior and CORT responses of tadpoles exposed to predator chemical cue in combination with parasite cue or under direct exposure to parasites. We then measured the combined effects of predator cue and parasite infection on survival and traits. Evidence for effects of parasite cue in our study was equivocal, but we found novel interactive effects of parasites and predators on larval frogs. Parasites and predators had antagonistic effects on CORT, behavior, and morphology, and negative synergistic effects on development. In addition, parasite infection and predator cues additively reduced activity levels of both species and growth in wood frogs. Negative effects of parasite infection on survival and traits were dose-dependent for both species, although wood frogs generally experienced stronger effects of infection than green frogs. Our results emphasize the importance of considering effects of parasites as well as predators, since both can have strong effects on survival and the combination can have both additive and non-additive effects on key traits.

The response of Pacific Northwest (PNW) Z. marina to interactive effects of temperature and nitrogen conditions was experimentally evaluated. Experimental manipulations were conducted hydroponically in acrylic chambers. Preliminary single factor experiments were conducted to evaluate physiological tolerances to temperature and nitrogen concentrations. Eelgrass exhibited a statistically significant linear increase in relative growth with increasing NH4 concentration (range from 5 to 1000 mu M); in contrast, there was no relationship between relative growth rate and increasing NO3 concentration. After 14 d there were no indications of plant mortality associated with NH4 or NO3. Leaf growth metrics exhibited strong statistically significant linear relationships with increasing water temperature (temperature range 4-25 degrees C), indicating broad thermal tolerance. In the factorial experiment, triplicate plants were exposed to 3 temperatures (10, 18 and 25 C) and 3 nitrate concentrations (10,30 and 100 mu M). Most metrics (leaf elongation, growth, relative growth, wasting index) exhibited a statistically significant temperature effect but no nutrient concentration effect, indicating the importance of temperature on metabolic rates. Plants at 18 and 25 C had significantly more wasting disease than plants at 10 C. Tissue delta N-15 and C:N values exhibited significant nutrient concentration and temperature effects, indicating that both factors influenced how much NO3 was incorporated into the tissues. Whole plant non structural carbohydrate content exhibited no significant response to either temperature or nitrate concentration. Temperature played a dominant role controlling Z. marina response to nutrients; nitrogen toxicity was not observed, and in general the effects of temperature and nutrients were not synergistic.

The pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), now widespread in Neotropical mountains, may act in synergy with climate change causing collapse in thermally stressed hosts. We measured the thermal tolerance of frogs along a wide elevational gradient in the Tropical Andes, where frog populations have collapsed. We used the difference between critical thermal maximum and the temperature a frog experiences in nature as a measure of tolerance to high temperatures. Temperature tolerance increased as elevation increased, suggesting that frogs at higher elevations may be less sensitive to rising temperatures. We tested the alternative pathogen optimal growth hypothesis that prevalence of the pathogen should decrease as temperatures fall outside the optimal range of pathogen growth. Our infection-prevalence data supported the pathogen optimal growth hypothesis because we found that prevalence of Bd increased when host temperatures matched its optimal growth range. These findings suggest that rising temperatures may not be the driver of amphibian declines in the eastern slopes of the Andes. Zoonotic outbreaks of Bd are the most parsimonious hypothesis to explain the collapse of montane amphibian faunas; but our results also reveal that lowland tropical amphibians, despite being shielded from Bd by higher temperatures, are vulnerable to climate-warming stress.

El hongo patogeno Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), actualmente ampliamente distribuido en las montanas neotropicales, puede actuar en conjunto con el cambio climatico, causando un colapso en los hospederos termalmente estresados. Medimos la tolerancia termal de las ranas a lo largo de un amplio gradiente de elevacion en la zona tropical de los Andes, donde las poblaciones de ranas han colapsado. Usamos la diferencia entre la temperatura critica maxima y la temperatura que una rana experimenta en la naturaleza como medida de tolerancia a altas temperaturas. La tolerancia a la temperatura incremento junto con la elevacion, sugiriendo que las ranas de elevaciones mas altas son menos sensibles al incremento en la temperatura. Probamos la hipotesis alternativa del crecimiento optimo del patogeno segun la cual la prevalencia del patogeno disminuye conforme las temperaturas caen fuera del rango optimo para su crecimiento. Nuestros datos de prevalencia de infeccion apoyaron la hipotesis de crecimiento optimo del patogeno ya que encontramos que la prevalencia de Bd incremento cuando la temperatura de los hospederos equivalia a su rango de crecimiento optimo.

Site occupancy of ringtail possum was influenced by habitat resources and the structural complexity of forest, which indirectly mediated predation risk. Presence of fox baiting had no direct effect on the ringtail site occupancy. In contrast, access to prey resources and fox baiting appeared to best explain site occupancy variation in monitor lizards across the landscape.

Facilitation is known as the positive effect of one species (benefactor) on associated neighbouring species (beneficiaries). Although the beneficial part of this interaction has received considerable research interest, there is a gap of knowledge on the bidirectional nature of these interactions; in particular, the physiological and fitness consequences for both beneficiaries and benefactors. 2. Alpine cushion plants are generally strong benefactors, increasing species richness and abundance on a global scale, and provide a suitable system to study the physiological effects of bidirectional interactions and its consequences for reproduction. Current knowledge suggests that species improve their fitness when associated to a benefactor cushion species, whereas cushions may receive predominantly negative feedbacks. 3. We measured physiological and reproductive traits of the cushion species Arenaria tetraquetra ssp. amabilis and three other forbs (Eryngium glaciale, Lotus corniculatus ssp. glacialis and Plantago nivalis) in the dry Sierra Nevada Mountains, southern Spain. All four species were studied either when growing alone or when the three forbs were associated with the cushion plant. 4. The three forb species improved their water status when associated with the cushion, and Lotus and Plantago significantly increased their seed set. In contrast, Arenaria showed poorer water status and reduced flower density and seed set with increasing cover of beneficiary species. There was a clear relationship between physiological and reproductive traits in Arenaria growing without beneficiaries but not in Arenaria with beneficiaries. Control cushions (without beneficiary species) showed increased seed set and seed mass with increasing photosynthetic and water use efficiencies, respectively, the latter being positively related to leaf nitrogen content. In contrast, cushions with a large cover of beneficiary species did not show such relations. The missing relationship between physiological and reproductive traits for these facilitating cushions indicates that reproductive output in heavily colonized cushions may not be directly related to the plant physiological status and the availability of resources. 5. Our results revealed the antagonistic behaviour underlying the interaction between beneficiary species and facilitating cushion plants, similar to parasitic interactions.

However, strong differential numerical effects occurred among crustaceans as a function of species and sex, with shrimp (75 %), and female crabs (55 %), exhibiting the fastest and greatest declines in numbers. These declines were due to forceful eviction from the coral-host by male crabs. Furthermore, surviving female crabs were impacted by a dramatic decline (85 %) in egg production, which could have deleterious consequences for population sustainability.

Decades of research have provided a litany of examples of the potential for shrubs as nurse plants for establishment of desirable species, especially in water-limited environments. However, interactions with the existing understory community may alter the outcome of interactions between shrubs and understory plants. A manipulative experiment was conducted to disentangle interactions between a native forb species (Penstemon palmeri A. Gray), a native shrub (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.), and a diverse understory of exotic and native forbs and grasses in a semi-arid shrubland of Northern Utah, USA. Seedlings of P. palmeri were transplanted in a factorial design: (1) beneath shrub canopies or into their interspaces and (2) with understory interactions retained or removed. Transplant survival was tracked for roughly 1 year. Shrubs appeared to facilitate P. palmeri survival while interactions with the existing understory community were equivalently negative, leading to overall neutral interactions. Further, positive shrub interactions and negative understory interactions appeared to operate independently and simultaneously. While the debate over the importance of facilitation and competition in driving plant community dynamics continues, our observations strongly suggest that both have considerable effects on plant establishment in A. tridentata communities.

First, realistic global change scenarios involve multiple drivers of environmental change that can interact with one another to produce non-additive effects. Second, in addition to these direct effects, global change drivers can indirectly affect plants by modifying species interactions. In order to tackle both of these challenges, we propose a novel population modeling approach, requiring only measurements of abundance and climate over time. To demonstrate the applicability of this approach, we model population dynamics of eight abundant plant species in a multifactorial global change experiment in alpine tundra where we manipulated nitrogen, precipitation, and temperature over 7years. We test whether indirect and interactive effects are important to population dynamics and whether explicitly incorporating species interactions can change predictions when models are forecast under future climate change scenarios. For three of the eight species, population dynamics were best explained by direct effect models, for one species neither direct nor indirect effects were important, and for the other four species indirect effects mattered. Overall, global change had negative effects on species population growth, although species responded to different global change drivers, and single-factor effects were slightly more common than interactive direct effects. When the fitted population dynamic models were extrapolated under changing climatic conditions to the end of the century, forecasts of community dynamics and diversity loss were largely similar using direct effect models that do not explicitly incorporate species interactions or best-fit models; however, inclusion of species interactions was important in refining the predictions for two of the species.

The stress gradient hypothesis predicts that under physiologically stressful environmental conditions abiotic factors shape range edges while in less stressful environments negative biotic interactions are more important. Butterflies provide a suitable system to test this hypothesis since larvae of most species depend on biotic interactions with a specific set of host plants, which in turn can shape patterns of occurrence and distribution. Here we modelled the distribution of 92 butterfly and 136 host plant species with three different modelling algorithms, using distribution data from the Swiss biodiversity monitoring scheme at a 1 x 1 km spatial resolution. By comparing the ensemble prediction for each butterfly species and the corresponding host plant(s), we assessed potential constraints imposed by host plant availability on distribution of butterflies at their distributional limits along the main environmental gradient, which closely parallels an elevational gradient. Our results indicate that host limitation does not play a role at the lower limit. At the upper limit 50% of butterfly species have a higher elevational limit than their primary host plant, and 33% have upper elevational limits that exceed the limits of both primary and secondary hosts. We conclude that host plant limitation was not relevant to butterfly distributional limits in less stressful environments and that distributions are more likely limited by climate, land use or antagonistic biotic interactions. Obligatory dependency of butterflies on their host plants, however, seems to represent an important limiting factor for the distribution of some species towards the cold, upper end of the environmental gradient, suggesting that biotic factors can shape ranges in stressful environments.

Beetle species richness significantly increased with the number of years that the pastures had been grazed. Ivermectin administration did not appear to have any adverse effect on dung beetle abundance, species richness, or species diversity.

Compared with species richness and species diversity, functional, phylogenetic, and taxonomic indices peaked later in the year, which was a consequence of the distribution of biomass among functionally and evolutionarily divergent species. Generalized additive models revealed that spatial, temporal, and environmental variables explained roughly similar proportions of deviance across all aspects of diversity, suggesting that these three factors do not differentially affect the functional and phylogenetic aspects of community structure.

Wetland management activities typically target plant communities, and bottom-up responses in higher trophic levels may be dependent on spatially explicit habitat use. We surveyed plant and amphibian assemblages at 26 sites enrolled in the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) in the Willamette Valley, Oregon to determine the relative influence of plant management, non-native species, and surrounding landscape on amphibian counts across multiple life history stages. Explanatory variables negatively associated with native anuran counts included percent invasive plant cover, non-native fish presence, invasive bullfrog counts, and area of urban land cover. In addition, native anurans were positively associated with WRP site age, suggesting that the benefits of restored wetlands may increase over time. This study emphasized the importance of adaptive approaches to maintaining diverse communities in restored habitats by considering impacts of synergistic stressors in a multi-invader context.

Good-genes-for-viability' models predict that females prefer mates of high additive genetic value, such that offspring survival should correlate with male attractiveness. Mate choice may also vary with genetic diversity (e.g. heterozygosity) or compatibility (e.g. relatedness), where the female's genotype influences choice. The relative importance of these nonexclusive hypotheses remains unclear. Leks offer an excellent opportunity to test their predictions, because lekking males provide no material benefits and choice is relatively unconstrained by social limitations. Using 12years of data on lekking lance-tailed manakins, Chiroxiphia lanceolata, we tested whether offspring survival correlated with patterns of mate choice. Offspring recruitment weakly increased with father attractiveness (measured as reproductive success, RS), suggesting attractive males provide, if anything, only minor benefits via offspring viability. Both male RS and offspring survival until fledging increased with male heterozygosity. However, despite parent-offspring correlation in heterozygosity, offspring survival was unrelated to its own or maternal heterozygosity or to parental relatedness, suggesting survival was not enhanced by heterozygosity per se. Instead, offspring survival benefits may reflect inheritance of specific alleles or nongenetic effects. Although inbreeding depression in male RS should select for inbreeding avoidance, mates were not less related than expected under random mating. Although mate heterozygosity and relatedness were correlated, selection on mate choice for heterozygosity appeared stronger than that for relatedness and may be the primary mechanism maintaining genetic variation in this system despite directional sexual selection.",1,2014,23,4,933,946,10.1111/mec.12652"Treasure, AM; Chown, SL",Antagonistic effects of biological invasion and temperature change on body size of island ectotherms,DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,Article,Environmental change; insects; predator-prey; resource use; sub-Antarctic,"AimDespite their potentially profound consequences, little is known about the impacts of interactions among environmental change drivers on indigenous species. For biological invasions, much theoretical prominence has been given to additive or synergistic interactions with temperature change. However, empirical investigations are sparse. Here, we investigate the outcomes of interactions between temperature change and biological invasions on ectotherm body size in a temperate system. LocationThe sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Island group (46 degrees 54S, 37 degrees 45E). MethodsWe use long-term (24years) body size data on weevil species from Marion and Prince Edward Islands. Invasive house mice, which prey on four of the five weevil species, are present on Marion Island, while the neighbouring Prince Edward Island is mouse free. Theory predicts that with higher temperatures, body size should decline across all species, and previous work suggests that size-selective predation by mice should enhance this effect on the invaded island. Generalized linear models were used to determine the relative effects of sex, island, altitude and mean annual temperature on body size for each of the species. ResultsTemperature change and biological invasions interact to affect body size in an antagonistic fashion. In weevil species not preyed on by invasive house mice, body size and declining size with increasing temperature are consistent across adjacent invaded and non-invaded islands. By contrast, species preyed on by mice are smaller on the invaded island and show opposite size-temperature relationships on the invaded and mouse-free islands. Main conclusionsSize declines on the non-invaded island are in keeping with theoretical expectations of declining size with increasing temperatures. By contrast, this expectation is not met on the island invaded by mice, largely owing to what appears to be increased energetic demand of predators in colder years.

These birds were declared an ""agriculture plage"" by the government and this conflict with humans has been so far resolved with species persecution. We evaluate whether its current wintering distribution is shaped by anthropogenic disturbances or whether it can be better explained by differences in topography and preference for wetlands, or by landscape composition and configuration. We characterized the study region using 17 potential predictors related to environmental, human and landscape characteristics. We built habitat-suitability models to examine the relative effect of the variables on the regional occurrence of Sheldgeese. We performed vehicle surveys in southern Buenos Aires province, in two years (2011-2012), surveying 9200 km of roads and recording 281 Sheldgeese flocks. Generalized additive models were used to model the presence/absence of Geese in 250-m cells. The habitat suitability models of Sheldgeese suggest that: (1) areas of low elevation surrounded by waterbodies are one of the main positive drivers of species distribution, (2) centers of human activity, which are regions with greater road accessibility, have a negative impact on species distribution, (3) heterogeneous landscape composed of croplands and grazing fields are preferred environments.

High interaction generalization is ""the norm"" in most systems, allowing alien species to infiltrate recipient communities. We identify traits that influence invasiveness (e.g., selfing capacity in plants, animal behavioral traits) or invasibility (e.g., partner choice in mycorrhizas/rhizobia) through mutualistic interactions.

The present study experimentally assessed whether the effect of light-related stress and the attenuating effect of shade as a facilitator of seedling germination, survival and growth affect the expression of heritable variation and the potential for a response to selection in the columnar cactus Pilosocereus leucocephalus. A reciprocal transplant experiment combined with the artificial manipulation of light/shade conditions within greenhouses was performed using seeds from controlled crosses of two natural populations (demes PN and SI). Additive genetic variance (V-A), heritability (h(2)) and the coefficient of variation of additive variance (CVA) were estimated for per cent of germination, per cent of seedling survival and growth (biomass) under each treatment combination. Although all three recruitment traits showed evidence of different from zero heritability, this result was highly dependent upon the particular transplant site, deme and light treatment combination. The deme that is still not locally adapted (SI) showed significant heritability for all traits and much more potential for a response selection as indicated by a higher CVA than the locally adapted deme PN. The effect of light conditions on the expression of V-A, h(2) and CVA depended on whether the deme was grown in its native or an alien site, but this interaction was only detected for the less adapted deme of SI. Shade conditions promoted by facilitation reduced the evolutionary potential for germination of both demes through an attenuation of genetic differences among genotypes.

Even though many factors affect corals, we have very little data on the relationship between multiple co-occurring stressors and their compounding effects on these critical ecosystem engineers. We provide evidence that under short-term exposure, the presence of the brown alga Dictyota menstrualis has direct negative consequences for coral survival and recruitment, while seawater elevated to + 3.5 degrees C causes sub-lethal stress and compromises coral health. Three life-history stages (larvae, 6 wk-old juveniles [similar to 0.15 cm(2)], and 1-2 yr-old colonies [0.8-45 cm(2)]) of the common Caribbean coral Porites astreoides were exposed to each stressor alone and in combination. Exposure to D. menstrualis reduced the survival of P. astreoides larvae and 6 wk-old juveniles by similar to 40% and caused partial mortality in 1-2 yr-old colonies. Elevated temperature did not cause mortality, but induced sub-lethal stress that was disparate among coral life-history stages. These stressors in combination predominately impacted corals in an independent manner. However, extended exposure resulted in a synergistic enhancement of oxidative damage (lipid peroxidation) in P. astreoides larvae. Our results suggest that benthic macroalgae can greatly inhibit coral recruitment, and this pressure combined with rising sea-surface temperatures re presents a significant threat to the health of coral reef ecosystems.

We exposed field-collected juveniles of Asterias rubens from Kiel Fjord (western Baltic Sea) to 3 seawater CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) levels (ranging from around 650 to 3500 mu atm) in a long-term (39 wk) and a short-term (6 wk) experiment. In both experiments, survival and calcification were not affected by elevated pCO(2). However, feeding rates decreased strongly with increasing pCO(2), while aerobic metabolism and NH4+ excretion were not significantly affected by CO2 exposure. Consequently, high pCO(2) reduced the scope for growth in A. rubens. Growth rates decreased substantially with increasing pCO(2) and were reduced even at pCO(2) levels occurring in the habitat today (e.g. during upwelling events). Sea stars were not able to acclimate to higher pCO(2), and growth performance did not recover during the long-term experiment. Therefore, the top-down control exerted by this keystone species may be diminished during periods of high environmental pCO(2) that already occur occasionally and will be even higher in the future. However, some individuals were able to grow at high rates even at high pCO(2), indicating potential for rapid adaption.

This provided us with insights into small-scale processes of land enclosure and conversion, which indicate that agricultural intensification is taking place. We learned that although the landscape could in theory accommodate a lot of jatropha hedges around existing (maize dominated) arable land, farmers were only creating hedges around new fields, carved out in the grazing commons. Already well established within the settlement, jatropha can produce a range of different ecosystem services.

Intertidal boulder reefs with different rock types often have distinct benthic assemblages, and their ecology is structured strongly by succession. Therefore, dynamics causing assemblage variability may involve an interaction of factors involved in succession with features of the substratum. The current experiments monitored 11 month successional trajectories of benthic invertebrates on 2 rock types (siltstone and limestone) with differing physical characteristics. Unmanipulated boulders in siltstone and limestone reefs had different assemblages, but when bare boulders of the non-native rock type were transplanted into reefs, assemblages developing on non-native boulders were in most ways similar to those on boulders of the reef's native rock type. A substratum-dependent variation in successional trajectories was observed for one taxon, the true limpet Notoacmea spp. Under specific conditions of rock type at the individual boulder scale and the wider reef scale, evidence was found of a consistent peak in abundance during early succession. Notoacmea spp. was also positively associated not only with siltstone reefs but also with individual siltstone boulders, suggesting an effect of rock type at the boulder scale. Although processes occurring at scales encompassing whole reefs mostly dictate how these assemblages are associated with rock type, some species are affected by rock type at the boulder scale, and the effect can vary during succession.

O. franklini was found to reach extremely high densities (> 41000 m(-2)), yet abundance was strongly heterogeneous on all spatial scales tested. Temporal variation in abundance was also significant and was location-specific, potentially reflecting fluctuations in food supply and variable conditions resulting from ice disturbance. Principal component analysis and generalised additive modelling revealed evidence of a relationship between the distribution of O. franklini and the sediment, which was consistent with its deposit-feeding trophic niche. Generally, the abundance of O. franklini increased with de creasing sediment grain size and increasing trace element concentration.

Although the instrument of payments for ecosystem services (PES) has emerged as a promising tool to safeguard or enhance the provision of ecosystem services (ES), little attention has been paid to the potential role of PES in climate change adaptation. As an external stressor climate change has an impact on the social-ecological system in which PES takes place, including the various actors taking part in the PES scheme. Following a short description of the conceptual link between PES and adaptation to climate change, we provide practical insights into the relationship between PES and adaptation to climate change by presenting results from a case study of a rural watershed in Kenya. Drawing upon the results of a participatory vulnerability assessment among potential ecosystem service providers in Sasumua watershed north of Nairobi, we show that PES can play a role in enhancing adaptation to climate change by influencing certain elements of adaptive capacity and incentivizing adaptation measures. In addition, trade-offs and synergies between proposed measures under PES and adaptation to climate change are identified. Results show that although it may not be possible to establish PES schemes based on water utilities as the sole source of financing, embedding PES in a wider adaptation framework creates an opportunity for the development of watershed PES schemes in Africa and ensures their sustainability. We conclude that there is a need to embed PES in a wider institutional framework and that extra financial resources are needed to foster greater integration between PES and adaptation to climate change. This can be achieved through scaling up PES by bringing in other buyers and additional ecosystem services. PES can achieve important coadaptation benefits, but for more effective adaptation outcomes it needs to be combined with vulnerability assessments and climate scenarios to ensure that these are realized and potential trade-offs between PES measures and adaptation measures minimized.",0,2014,19,1,,,10.5751/ES-06199-190147"Woodgate, JL; Buchanan, KL; Bennett, ATD; Catchpole, CK; Brighton, R; Leitner, S",ENVIRONMENTAL AND GENETIC CONTROL OF BRAIN AND SONG STRUCTURE IN THE ZEBRA FINCH,EVOLUTION,Article,Birdsong; genotype-by-environment interaction; heritability; HVC; song system; Taeniopygia guttata,"Birdsong is a classic example of a learned trait with cultural inheritance, with selection acting on trait expression.

For example, temperate deciduous trees produce large amounts of phenolic compounds (primarily tannins), but many of these trees also produce smaller amounts of other potentially toxic compounds. This study tested the hypothesis that mixtures of phenolics and other types of toxins produce a greater effect on oxidative stress (a measure of toxicity) than do phenolics alone. Oxidative stress was measured in Lymantria dispar (gypsy moth) larvae as a shift in the redox balance of glutathione (GSH) towards a higher percentage of its oxidized form (glutathione disulfide; GSSG). We began by showing that larvae that ingested ellagitannins and chlorogenic acid (phenolics) contained greatly elevated levels of reactive oxygen species in their midgut contents, but this was not sufficient to shift the redox balance of GSH in their midgut tissues. Therefore, the phenolic compounds were tested in pairwise combinations with juglone (a quinone), rutin, kaempferol, or quercitrin (flavonoids), quinine, berberine, gramine, or glaucine (alkaloids), and soy or Quillaja saponins. When each of these allelochemical combinations was treated on hybrid poplar (Populus tremula x P. alba) leaves and consumed by L. dispar larvae for a 2-day period, none significantly shifted the redox balance of GSH. GSH levels were induced by the combination of phenolics with an alkaloid and a saponin, suggesting that a ""cocktail"" of allelochemicals might produce a more effective plant defense. GSH levels were also found to increase with larval age, both within and between instars. Increased levels of GSH may help explain the greater resistance of late-instar than early-instar larvae to plant defenses. Overall, the results of this study do not support the hypothesis that the combined effects of phenolic compounds and other toxins in sugar maple (Acer saccharum) leaves produce a synergistic increase in oxidative stress in L. dispar larvae.

However, physiological responses of intertidal organisms to repetitive exposure to severe conditions using natural patterns are rarely explored, and we know little about how physiological sensitivity within a species varies over local scales or among natural populations, making it difficult to extrapolate results to the naturally variable environmental conditions encountered in the field. Here, we simulate realistic scenarios of the exposure of the turf-forming alga (Gelidium chilense) to atmospheric stressors (UVB and temperature) associated with natural mild or harsh weather conditions that occur when summertime midday low tides coincide with unusually calm seas and particularly warm, sunny days along the central Chilean coast. We show that sudden, short-term exposure to artificial UVB radiation during daytime low tides represents a strong stress factor for Gelidium turf algae as measured by the changes in maximal photosynthetic quantum yield (Fv/Fm), and repetitive exposure over a period of 5 d, as it occurs naturally during spring summer days, can critically compromise the ability of the fronds to recover once the stressor is removed. In contrast, while increased aerial temperature had important effects on the photosynthetic system, this source of stress had no lasting effects on the fronds' capacity to recover, nor did it modify the UVB effects on photosynthesis (i.e. no synergistic effects between these common stressors). The ability of Gelidium turf to recover from UVB-induced damage to the photosynthetic apparatus differed between tidal heights and among populations from different sites along the central coast. These results suggest that for many shore communities, abrupt, unpredictable short-term stress events will have greater consequences lower on the shore. We found no evidence that greater upwelling intensity and associated nutrient enrichment of coastal waters could consistently ameliorate recovery from the negative effects of UVB. The complex spatial variation in the turfs ability to recover rapidly from a stress event may alter predictions regarding the effects of extreme climate events and/or climate change on species interactions and species' geographic distribution.

We focused our study on an invasive tree species, the Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera), that annually sheds its leaves and produces leaf litter that is known to negatively impact aquatic amphibian survival. The purpose of our research was to determine whether the timing of leaf fall from Chinese tallow and the timing of amphibian breeding (determined by weather) influence survival of amphibian larvae. We simulated a range of winter weather scenarios, ranging from cold to warm, by altering the relative timing of when leaf litter and amphibian larvae were introduced into aquatic mesocosms. Our results indicate that amphibian larvae survival was greatly affected by the length of time Chinese tallow leaf litter decomposes in water prior to the introduction of the larvae. Larvae in treatments simulating warm winters (early amphibian breeding) were introduced to the mesocosms early in the aquatic decomposition process of the leaf litter and had significantly lower survival compared with cold winters (late amphibian breeding), likely due to significantly lower dissolved oxygen levels. Shifts to earlier breeding phenology, linked to warming climate, have already been observed in many amphibian taxa, and with most climate models predicting a significant warming trend over the next century, the trend toward earlier breeding should continue if not increase. Our results strongly suggest that a warming climate can interact with the effects of invasive plant species, in ways we have not previously considered, to reduce the survival of an already declining group of organisms.",0,2013,3,14,4828,4840,10.1002/ece3.857"Kelly, LT; Dayman, R; Nimmo, DG; Clarke, MF; Bennett, AF","Spatial and temporal drivers of small mammal distributions in a semi-arid environment: The role of rainfall, vegetation and life-history",AUSTRAL ECOLOGY,Article,arid; habitat; landscape; mammal; species distribution model,"A key task in ecology is to understand the drivers of animal distributions. In arid and semi-arid environments, this is challenging because animal populations show considerable spatial and temporal variation. An effective approach in such systems is to examine both broad-scale and long-term data. We used this approach to investigate the distribution of small mammal species in semi-arid mallee' vegetation in south-eastern Australia. First, we examined broad-scale data collected at 280 sites across the Murray Mallee region. We used generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) to examine four hypotheses concerning factors that influence the distribution of individual mammal species at this scale: vegetation structure, floristic diversity, topography and recent rainfall. Second, we used long-term data from a single conservation reserve (surveyed from 1997 to 2012) to examine small mammal responses to rainfall over a period spanning a broad range of climatic conditions, including record high rainfall in 2011. Small mammal distributions were strongly associated with vegetation structure and rainfall patterns, but the relative importance of these drivers was species-specific. The distribution of the mallee ningaui Ningaui yvonneae, for example, was largely determined by the cover of hummock grass; whereas the occurrence of the western pygmy possum Cercartetus concinnus was most strongly associated with above-average rainfall. Further, the combination of both broad-scale and long-term data provided valuable insights. Bolam's mouse Pseudomys bolami was uncommon during the broad-scale survey, but long-term surveys showed that it responds positively to above-average rainfall. Conceptual models developed for small mammals in temperate and central arid Australia, respectively, were not, on their own, adequate to account for the distributional patterns of species in this semi-arid ecosystem. Species-specific variation in the relative importance of different drivers was more effectively explained by qualitative differences in life-history attributes among species.",3,2013,38,7,786,797,10.1111/aec.12018"Grass, I; Berens, DG; Peter, F; Farwig, N",Additive effects of exotic plant abundance and land-use intensity on plant-pollinator interactions,OECOLOGIA,Article,Global change; Alien plants; Agricultural intensification; Pollination; Specialization,"The continuing spread of exotic plants and increasing human land-use are two major drivers of global change threatening ecosystems, species and their interactions. Separate effects of these two drivers on plant-pollinator interactions have been thoroughly studied, but we still lack an understanding of combined and potential interactive effects. In a subtropical South African landscape, we studied 17 plant-pollinator networks along two gradients of relative abundance of exotics and land-use intensity. In general, pollinator visitation rates were lower on exotic plants than on native ones. Surprisingly, while visitation rates on native plants increased with relative abundance of exotics and land-use intensity, pollinator visitation on exotic plants decreased along the same gradients. There was a decrease in the specialization of plants on pollinators and vice versa with both drivers, regardless of plant origin. Decreases in pollinator specialization thereby seemed to be mediated by a species turnover towards habitat generalists. However, contrary to expectations, we detected no interactive effects between the two drivers. Our results suggest that exotic plants and land-use promote generalist plants and pollinators, while negatively affecting specialized plant-pollinator interactions. Weak integration and high specialization of exotic plants may have prevented interactive effects between exotic plants and land-use. Still, the additive effects of exotic plants and land-use on specialized plant-pollinator interactions would have been overlooked in a single-factor study.

Here, we identified key drivers of mangrove loss in Kenya and compared two different approaches to predicting risk. Risk factors tested included various possible predictors of anthropogenic deforestation, related to population, suitability for land use change and accessibility. Two approaches were taken to modelling risk; a quantitative statistical approach and a qualitative categorical ranking approach. A quantitative model linking rates of loss to risk factors was constructed based on generalized least squares regression and using mangrove loss data from 1992 to 2000. Population density, soil type and proximity to roads were the most important predictors. In order to validate this model it was used to generate a map of losses of Kenyan mangroves predicted to have occurred between 2000 and 2010. The qualitative categorical model was constructed using data from the same selection of variables, with the coincidence of different risk factors in particular mangrove areas used in an additive manner to create a relative risk index which was then mapped. Quantitative predictions of loss were significantly correlated with the actual loss of mangroves between 2000 and 2010 and the categorical risk index values were also highly correlated with the quantitative predictions. Hence, in this case the relatively simple categorical modelling approach was of similar predictive value to the more complex quantitative model of mangrove deforestation.

These factors are unlikely to act on isolation, but their combined effects are poorly understood. We explored these effects in Catopsis compacta, an epiphytic bromeliad commercially harvested in Oaxaca, Mexico. We analyzed local climate change projections, the dynamics of the vegetation patches, the distribution of Catopsis in the patches, together with population genetics and demographic information. A drying and warming climate trend projected by most climate change models may contribute to explain the poor forest regeneration. Catopsis shows a positive mean stochastic population growth. A PVA reveals that quasi-extinction probabilities are not significantly affected by the current levels of harvesting or by a high drop in the frequency of wet years (2%) but increase sharply when harvesting intensity duplicates. Genetic analyses show a high population genetic diversity, and no evidences of population subdivision or a past bottleneck. Colonization mostly takes place on hosts at the edges of the fragments. Over the last 27years, the vegetation cover has being lost at a 0.028years(-1) rate, but fragment perimeter has increased 0.076years(-1). The increases in fragment perimeter and vegetation openness, likely caused by climate change and logging, appear to increase the habitat of Catopsis, enhance gene flow, and maintain a growing and highly genetically diverse population, in spite of harvesting. Our study evidences conflicting requirements between the epiphytes and their hosts and antagonistic effects of climate change and fragmentation with harvesting on a species that can exploit open spaces in the forest.

In order to experimentally separate paternal (i.e. genetic) from maternal and environmental effects, and determine whether and how stress affects the heritable variation for MHC expression, embryos were produced in full-factorial in vitro fertilizations, reared singly, and exposed at 208 degree days (late-eyed stage) to either one of two strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens that differ in their virulence characteristics (one increased mortality, while both delayed hatching time). Gene expression was assessed 48h postinoculation, and virulence effects of the bacterial infection were monitored until hatching. We found no evidence of MHC class II expression at this stage of development. MHC class I expression was markedly down-regulated in reaction to both pseudomonads. While MHC expression could not be linked to embryo survival, the less the gene was expressed, the earlier the embryos hatched within each treatment group, possibly due to trade-offs between immune function and developmental rate or further factors that affect both hatching timing and MHC expression. We found significant additive genetic variance for MHC class I expression in some treatments. That is, changes in pathogen pressures could induce rapid evolution in MHC class I expression.

We have been examining the occurrence of endangered and strictly protected Hungarian root vole subspecies (Microtus oeconomus mehelyi) within the framework of Hungarian Biodiversity Monitoring System Program in Kis-Balaton. We analyzed the dynamics of root vole site occupancy based on 12-year-long period data. From a conservation aspect we investigated how root vole site occupancy dynamics differed in the area under NATURA 2000 protected marshland habitat management and in the privatized marshland under regular perturbation, compared to the initial, disturbance-free conditions. We applied multi-season occupancy models and we took into consideration the effects of perturbance, such as burning and mowing, and natural disturbances such as water cover and weather (wetter, drier weather period). Based on monitoring data there were 397 successful root vole captures and we identified 262 individuals. The results of both detection and occupancy estimates showed that the comprehensive mowing affecting the entire privatized area appeared as a disturbing effect, causing the emigration of the root voles. Most important factor in the loss of root vole is the additive effects of burning and natural aridity. Disturbances and perturbations of certain areas induce movements and spatial translocations which play role in the exchange of genes and individuals, ensuring to maintain the genetic variability of the remaining relict population.

The latter often rely on methods, which repeatedly fragment the underground system, thereby trigger adventitious and axillary buds to sprout, and consequently reduce the amount of stored energy. If carried out at times when no re-growth occurs, treatments will have little effect on weed populations, but cost much in terms of labour and energy. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the seasonal variation in bud sprouting capacity after fragmentation. Five troublesome perennial weed species, collected in northern and southern Sweden, were grown outdoors in Uppsala, Sweden (N 59A degrees 49', E 17A degrees 39'), from May 2009 to January 2010. Cut root and rhizome fragments, taken at two weeks intervals from July to January, were used to evaluate bud sprouting capacity, which was statistically analyzed using generalized additive models.

Models that exclude DD or use generic DD functions for populations in which density may be an important form of regulation may introduce bias into management decisions. Understanding the interaction between DD and stressors on demographic endpoints is needed to ensure models applied in management have the potential to detect compensatory or synergistic interactions between the two. This relationship was explored through the development of a DD demographic model for the sheepshead minnow (Cyprinodon variegatus) containing data-defined functions of DD for adult survival, fecundity, and growth. Concentration response curves were developed for organism-level effects from chronic laboratory studies with four chemicals (estradiol, trenbolone, trifluralin, chlordane) causing impacts that vary in endpoint and magnitude. Concentration-response curves were also developed for three hypothetical chemicals (HC) that affected only adult survival (HC-A), fecundity (HC-B), or juvenile growth (HC-C). Population growth rate (PGR) was determined across a range of densities and concentrations for each chemical. PGR contours revealed potential DD-stressor interactions ranging from compensatory to synergistic, which were a function of the combination of DD forms applied in the model and the organism-level impacts of the stressor. Simulations of population projections verified the potential compensatory and synergistic interactions of density and stressors depicted by the PGR contours. The strongest compensation occurred where survival was both DD and impacted by the stressor. When DD survival was omitted, DD fecundity and growth were drivers of PGR, but had limited compensatory influence. These interactions reflect the importance of DD demographic rates to population projections, which should be incorporated into models applied in the management of species in which density may be an important population driver.

Algal competition and corallivory are two major stressors contributing to the decline of coral reefs. Here, we provide the first evidence of algal-induced corallivory and synergistic effects between the two stressors on corals. When corals (Montastraea faveolata) were placed in contact with algae (Halimeda opuntia) together with corallivorous fireworms (Hermodice carunculata) in aquaria, corals suffered high tissue mortality. This mortality was reduced in the presence of algae only, and no mortality occurred in the presence of fireworms only or when excluding both algae and fireworms. These findings were supported by field observations showing a predominance of fireworms inside algae contacting live corals, and by an in situ experiment demonstrating higher coral mortality in contact with algae left undisturbed than with algae from which all mobile epifauna were periodically removed. Among the main contributing mechanisms, we suggest that algal contact produces decaying coral tissue that attracts the corallivore and enhances its aggregation behavior.

Main conclusions Our results demonstrate that a combination of elevation, area and MDE provide a basic explanation for the diversity of vascular plants in Pantepui. In addition, the present study indicates that maxima of STE are located at the highest altitudes, where the possibility of biotic connection (via migration) and gene flux has been minimal, even during glacial phases when most migration pathways amongst the tepui mountains were open.

The interaction with external stressors like fragmentation could exacerbate the effects of internal ecosystem drivers like herbivory, with distinct implications for ecosystem management. We used manipulative field experiments to assess these interactive effects in two Posidonia oceanica seagrass meadows. We monitored replicated plots in small and large patches in two meadows suffering fragmentation with and without herbivores (using exclusion cages) to test whether fragment size and herbivory could act together to alter ecosystem functioning. We measured changes in defoliation rates, primary production, canopy height and nutrient content in all plots after 4months of herbivore exclusion. Our results show that herbivores increased defoliation rates resulting in reduced primary production, nutrient content and canopy structure (canopy height). Patch size (fragment) on its own also reduced primary production, nutrient content and canopy structure. We also observed significant additive interactions between herbivores and fragmentation on canopy structure and production responses. In addition, small patches showed nutrient limitation but were able to accumulate more carbohydrate reserves, probably due to a higher light availability. This may explain why small patches can persist under significant herbivore pressure. Synthesis. While fragmentation has already been identified as an important external agent of seagrass decline, the combination of fragmentation and herbivory can seriously exacerbate structural losses and affect primary production, profoundly compromising the role of seagrasses as habitat-forming ecosystems.

In this study, we investigated the extent to which closely related insect herbivores with slight differences in their feeding behaviour induce contrasting reactions in plant communities. We studied the impact of herbivory by two Gomphocerinae grasshopper species, Chorthippus scalaris and Euthystira brachyptera, on the outcome of competition between the plant species Dactylis glomerata and Festuca paniculata. Under a controlled choice experiment, C. scalaris preferentially consumed D. glomerata while E. brachyptera preferred F. paniculata, but in an experimental plant community (mesocosm) both species consumed the plant species proportionally to their abundance and the amount of herbivory marks detected on the leaves did not depend on the specific grasshopper species. The herbivory pressure of both grasshopper species significantly reduced the vegetative height and the number of tillers of F. paniculata, with C. scalaris showing a stronger effect. As a consequence, herbivory by E. brachyptera did not significantly affect interspecific plant competition, whereas C. scalaris enhanced the dominance of D. glomerata. Our study shows that closely related herbivores that only slightly differ in their feeding behaviour can induce contrasting effects on interspecific plant competition, and that the dominant species D. glomerata is more tolerant to herbivory than F. paniculata.

However, it is not clear how infrastructure affects habitat quality for wildlife adapted to natural disturbances. While potentially providing suitable habitat such as early-successional forest, infrastructure also enables human access, which may modify animal' movements, especially where hunted species are concerned. To investigated the effect of infrastructure for moose (Alces alces, n = 138), a heavily harvested species, we modelled circadian distances and movement rates over the year as a function of moose' distance to the nearest road, house and power line in different human-modified landscapes in Sweden (latitude 57-67). Distances between moose and roads followed a circadian pattern. Animals were more likely to be closer to roads between 18:00 in the evening and 6:00 in the morning (i.e., during times when traffic volumes are generally lower). Moose moved relatively faster when 125 m or closer to a road, or alternatively, were closer to roads when more active. We did not find these relationships between moose and houses or power lines. With respect to roads, our results suggest that moose may make a temporal adjustment. During hours when humans are less active, road-near habitats may be sought out. We suggest considering different resolutions to study the impact of different infrastructure types. We recommend future research to investigate animal movement and behaviour in relation to infrastructure to understand the utilization of human-modified habitats over time, and thus providing key information for wildlife management and conservation, particularly for species that are adapted to disturbed landscapes.

Based on univariate measures of adaptive capacity, it has recently been suggested that species may have limited evolutionary potential to extend their upper thermal limits under ramping temperature conditions that better reflect heat stress in nature. To test these findings more broadly, we used a paternal half-sibling breeding design to estimate the multivariate evolutionary potential for upper thermal limits in Drosophila simulans. We assessed heat tolerance using static (basal and hardened) and ramping assays. Our analyses revealed significant evolutionary potential for all three measures of heat tolerance. Additive genetic variances were significantly different from zero for all three traits. Our G matrix analysis revealed that all three traits would contribute to a response to selection for increased heat tolerance. Significant additive genetic covariances and additive genetic correlations between static basal and hardened heat-knockdown time, marginally nonsignificant between static basal and ramping heat-knockdown time, indicate that direct and correlated responses to selection for increased upper thermal limits are possible.

This is particularly true in terms of the prevalence and severity of infectious disease, as stressors in combination will not always act to simply decrease the immune function of a host, but may instead interact to compound or even oppose the influence of parasitism on the health of an organism. Here, we explore the impact of environmental stress on host-parasite interactions using the water flea Daphnia magna and it is obligate parasite Pasteuria ramosa. Utilising an ecologically relevant stressor, we focus on the combined effect of salinity and P. ramosa on the fecundity and survival of the host, as well as on patterns of infectivity and the proliferation of the parasite. We show that in the absence of the parasite, host fecundity and survival was highest in the low salinity treatments. Once a parasite was introduced into the environment, however, salinity and parasitism acted antagonistically to influence both host survival and fecundity, and these patterns of disease were unrelated to infection rates or parasite spore loads. By summarising the form of interactions found in the broader Daphnia literature, we highlight how the combined effect of stress and parasitism will vary with the type of stressor, the trait used to describe the health of Daphnia and the host-parasite combination under observation. Our results highlight how the context-dependent nature of interactions between stress and parasitism inevitably complicates the link between environmental factors and the prevalence and severity of disease.",1,2013,171,4,789,796,10.1007/s00442-012-2452-3"Gibbons, ME; George, MP",Clutch identity and predator-induced hatching affect behavior and development in a leaf-breeding treefrog,OECOLOGIA,Article,Agalychnis callidryas; Life history traits; Niche shift plasticity; Clutch effects; Trade-offs,"For species with complex life cycles, transitions between life stages result in niche shifts that are often associated with evolutionary trade-offs. When conditions across life stages are unpredictable, plasticity in niche shift timing may be adaptive; however, factors associated with clutch identity (e.g., genetic or maternal) may influence the effects of such plasticity. The red-eyed treefrog (Agalychnis callidryas) is an ideal organism for investigating the effects of genetics and life stage switch point timing because embryos exhibit adaptive phenotypic plasticity in hatching time. In this study, we evaluated the effects of experimentally manipulated hatching time and clutch identity on antipredator behavior of tadpoles and on developmental traits of metamorphs, including larval period, mass, SVL, and jumping ability. We found that in the presence of dragonfly nymph predator cues at 21 days post-oviposition, tadpoles reduced both their activity level and height in the water column. Furthermore, early-hatched tadpoles were less active than late-hatched tadpoles of the same age. This difference in behavior patterns of early- and late-hatched tadpoles may represent an adaptive response due to a longer period of susceptibility to odonate predators for early-hatched tadpoles, or it may be a carry-over effect mediated by early exposure to an environmental stressor (i.e., induction of early hatching). We also found that hatching time affected both behavioral traits and developmental traits, but its effect on developmental traits varied significantly among clutches. This study shows that a single early-life event may influence a suite of factors during subsequent life stages and that some of these effects appear to be dependent on clutch identity. This interaction may represent an evolutionary response to a complex life cycle and unpredictable environments, regardless of whether the clutch differences are due to additive genetic variance or maternal effects.",2,2013,171,4,831,843,10.1007/s00442-012-2443-4"Saccone, P; Girel, J; Pages, JP; Brun, JJ; Michalet, R",Ecological resistance to Acer negundo invasion in a European riparian forest: relative importance of environmental and biotic drivers,APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE,Article,Acer negundo; Biotic interactions; Floodplain forests; Growth; Invasion; Survival,"Question The relative importance of environmental vs. biotic resistance of recipient ecological communities remains poorly understood in invasion ecology. Acer negundo, a North American tree, has widely invaded riparian forests throughout Europe at the ecotone between early- (Salix spp. and Populus spp.) and late-successional (Fraxinus spp.) species. However, it is not present in the upper part of the Rhone River, where native Alnus incana occurs at an intermediate position along the successional riparian gradient. Is this absence of the invasive tree due to environmental or biotic resistance of the recipient communities, and in particular due to the presence of Alnus? Location Upper Rhone River, France. Methods We undertook a transplant experiment in an Alnus-dominated community along the Upper Rhone River, where we compared Acer negundo survival and growth, with and without biotic interactions (tree and herb layer effects), to those of four native tree species from differing successional positions in the Upper Rhone communities (P. alba, S. alba, F. excelsior and Alnus incana). Results Without biotic interactions Acer negundo performed similarly to native species, suggesting that the Upper Rhone floodplain is not protected from Acer invasion by a simple abiotic barrier. In contrast, this species performed less well than F. excelsior and Alnus incana in environments with intact tree and/or herb layers. Alnus showed the best growth rate in these conditions, indicating biotic resistance of the native plant community. Conclusions We did not find evidence for an abiotic barrier to Acer negundo invasion of the Upper Rhone River floodplain communities, but our results suggest a biotic resistance. In particular, we demonstrated that (i) additive competitive effects of the tree and herb layer led to Acer negundo suppression and (ii) Alnus incana grew more rapidly than Acer negundo in this intermediate successional niche.",1,2013,16,2,184,192,10.1111/j.1654-109X.2012.01227.x"Hossack, BR; Lowe, WH; Honeycutt, RK; Parks, SA; Corn, PS","Interactive effects of wildfire, forest management, and isolation on amphibian and parasite abundance",ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,Article,Ambystoma macrodactylum; amphibian decline; burn severity; disturbance; fragmentation; global climate change; isolation; nematode; protected areas; Rana luteiventris; synergistic effects; transmission,"Projected increases in wildfire and other climate-driven disturbances will affect populations and communities worldwide, including host-parasite relationships. Research in temperate forests has shown that wildfire can negatively affect amphibians, but this research has occurred primarily outside of managed landscapes where interactions with human disturbances could result in additive or synergistic effects. Furthermore, parasites represent a large component of biodiversity and can affect host fitness and population dynamics, yet they are rarely included in studies of how vertebrate hosts respond to disturbance. To determine how wildfire affects amphibians and their parasites, and whether effects differ between protected and managed landscapes, we compared abundance of two amphibians and two nematodes relative to wildfire extent and severity around wetlands in neighboring protected and managed forests (Montana, USA). Population sizes of adult, male long-toed salamanders (Ambystoma macrodactylum) decreased with increased burn severity, with stronger negative effects on isolated populations and in managed forests. In contrast, breeding population sizes of Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris) increased with burn extent in both protected and managed protected forests. Path analysis showed that the effects of wildfire on the two species of nematodes were consistent with differences in their life history and transmission strategies and the responses of their hosts. Burn severity indirectly reduced abundance of soil-transmitted Cosmocercoides variabilis through reductions in salamander abundance. Burn severity also directly reduced C. variabilis abundance, possibly though changes in soil conditions. For the aquatically transmitted nematode Gyrinicola batrachiensis, the positive effect of burn extent on density of Columbia spotted frog larvae indirectly increased parasite abundance. Our results show that effects of wildfire on amphibians depend upon burn extent and severity, isolation, and prior land use. Through subsequent effects on the parasites, our results also reveal how changes in disturbance regimes can affect communities across trophic levels.",1,2013,23,2,479,492,"Harbeitner, RC; Hahn, ME; Timme-Laragy, AR",Differential sensitivity to pro-oxidant exposure in two populations of killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus),ECOTOXICOLOGY,Article,Fundulus heteroclitus; New Bedford Harbor; Oxidative Stress; Deformities; Ecotoxicology; Adaptation,"New Bedford Harbor (MA, U.S.A.; NBH) is a Superfund site inhabited by Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) with altered aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) signaling, leading to resistance to effects of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). The Ahr is a transcription factor that regulates gene expression of many Phase I and II detoxifying enzymes and interacts with Nrf2, a transcription factor that regulates the response to oxidative stress. This study tested the hypothesis that PCB-resistant killifish exhibit altered sensitivity to oxidative stress. Killifish F-1 embryos from NBH and a clean reference site (Scorton Creek, MA, U.S.A.; SC) were exposed to model pro-oxidant and Nrf2-activator, tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ). Embryos were exposed at specific embryonic developmental stages (5, 7, and 9 days post fertilization) and toxicity was assessed, using a deformity score, survival, heart rate, and gene expression to compare sensitivity between PCB -resistant and -sensitive (reference) populations. Acute exposure to tBHQ resulted in transient reduction in heart rate in NBH and SC F-1 embryos. However, embryos from NBH were more sensitive to tBHQ, with more frequent and severe deformities, including pericardial edema, tail deformities, small body size, and reduced pigment and erythrocytes. NBH embryos had lower basal expression of antioxidant genes catalase and glutathione-S-transferase alpha (gsta), and upon exposure to tBHQ, exhibited lower levels of expression of catalase, gsta, and superoxide dismutase compared to controls.

Yet current understanding of patterns of arable plant diversity at various scales remains limited. We evaluated the extent to which species richness of arable plants in the Rolling Pampas of Argentina is determined by field position (fencerow, edge and centre) and crop type, at both field (local) and landscape scales. Plant richness was assessed in maize, soybean and wheat-soybean fields across four landscape types differing in spatial complexity, as defined by percentage area devoted to cropland. Species richness was hierarchically nested within landscape types, field positions and crop types. Landscape richness (gamma-diversity, the cumulative number of species in a set of fields) was additively partitioned into two components, one for local richness (alpha-diversity, the mean number of species per field) and one denoting differences in species composition among fields (alpha-diversity, where beta = gamma - alpha). Field position was the main determinant of landscape-scale plant richness. Overall, gamma-diversity declined from fencerows, through field edges to field centres, but was unaffected by crop type. Spatial variation in species composition (beta-diversity), rather than species packing within fields (alpha-diversity), accounted for most of the variation in arable gamma-diversity. Higher beta-diversity in field edges than in field centres suggested that propagule dispersal from fencerow vegetation may create a 'mass effect' onto certain crop types. Shifts in gamma-diversity of major perennial life-forms (chamaeophytes and phanerophytes) between field positions and crop types reflected the contrasting disturbance regimes affecting plant communities of fencerows and cultivated fields. Our results indicate that preserving coherent and extensive fencerow networks is essential to conserve farmland biodiversity. Moreover, maintaining landscape heterogeneity to support elevated beta-diversities of arable plants requires cropping systems that promote crop diversity in both space and time.

Depending on the balance between antagonistic and mutualistic interactions, they can limit or promote the success of plant species. This is particularly important in the context of exotic plant invasions where soil biota can either increase the biotic resistance of habitats, or they can shift the balance between exotic and native plants towards the exotics and thereby greatly contribute to their dominance. Here, we explored the role of soil biota in the invasion success of exotic knotweed (FallopiaXbohemica), one of the world's most noxious invasive plants. We created artificial native plant communities that were experimentally invaded by knotweed, using a range of substrates where we manipulated different fractions of soil biota. We found that invasive knotweed benefited more from the overall presence of soil biota than any of the six native species. In particular the presence of the full natural soil biota strongly shifted the competitive balance in favor of knotweed. Soil biota promoted both regeneration and growth of the invader, which suggests that soil organisms may be important both in the early establishment of knotweed and possibly its later dominance of native communities. Addition of activated carbon to the soil made the advantage of knotweed disappear, which suggests that the mechanisms underlying the positive soil biota effects are chemically mediated.

We studied the effects of high seawater temperature and bacterial challenges on bleaching, metabolism, and antioxidant defenses of coral. The coral Montipora digitate and five bacterial strains (Vibrio coralliilyticus, Vibrio harveyi, Paracoccus carotinifaciens, Pseudoalteromonas sp., and Sulfitobacter sp.) were used in an inoculation experiment. The bacteria were isolated from the bleached corals and their surrounding seawater. At normal temperatures, the bacteria did not cause coral bleaching and did not affect metabolism or antioxidant enzyme activities. However, bacterial challenges in addition to high-temperature stress resulted in coral bleaching, with a 70% decrease in zooxanthellae density compared with the control, a 25% decrease in photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm), a 66% decrease in photosynthesis, and a 101% reduction in calcification activity. Tissue necrosis was observed in the most compromised branches. Respiration and activity levels of antioxidant enzymes were not affected. Corals under thermal stress alone showed signs of bleaching, but the changes in zooxanthellae density and metabolic rates were less severe than those under synergistic thermal stress and bacterial challenge. Among the bacteria examined, Sulfitobacter sp. had a greater capacity to enhance and accelerate the bleaching process under thermal stress. The mechanisms by which bacteria affect corals are not yet understood. Direct actions include infection and production of toxic substances by bacteria; indirect effects due to changes in the bacterial community under the influence of added bacteria must also be considered. Our results suggest that bacterial challenges combined with thermal stress can synergistically lead to negative outcomes in corals. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We found that 72% of the studies address questions at the interface of plant ecology and hydrology. The scarcity of studies of animals as drivers of hydrological patterns and processes led us to question the reasons behind plant-based ecologists embracing the term ecohydrology to a greater extent than animal-based ecologists. Following that discussion are current examples of synergies between animal ecologists and hydrologists that have led to a greater understanding of ecosystem processes and a way for ecohydrologists to factor in faunal interactions in their future research.

Integral projection models (IPMs) are used for this purpose, but it is unclear whether the conclusions drawn from their analysis are sensitive to how functional structures (the functions that describe how survival, growth and fecundity vary with individual size) are selected. We constructed 12 IPMs that differed in their functional structure by combining two reproduction models and three functional expressions (generalized linear, cubic and additive models), each with and without simplification. Models were parameterized with data from two populations of two endangered cacti subject to different disturbance intensities. For each model, we identified the demographic processes that most affected lambda in the presence of disturbance. Simulations were performed on artificial data and analyzed as above to assess the generality of the results. In both empirical and simulated data, the same processes were identified as making the largest contribution to changes in lambda regardless of the functional structure. The major differences in the results were due to misspecification of the fecundity functions, whilst functional expression and model simplification had lesser effects. Therefore, as long as the demographic attributes of the species are well known and incorporated into the model, IPMs will robustly identify the processes that most affect the growth of populations subject to disturbance, making them a reliable tool for developing conservation strategies.",2,2013,171,2,347,356,10.1007/s00442-012-2432-7"Wongchai, C; Chaidee, A; Pfeiffer, W",Enhancement and quantification of repellent activity in Chenopodium cells,ARTHROPOD-PLANT INTERACTIONS,Article,Autotroph/heterotroph Chenopodium rubrum cell cultures; Enhancement of behavioural activity in plant cells; Chitosan; Heat shock; Olfactometry with Tenebrio molitor larvae; Preference index constant; Salt stress,"Arthropod-plant interactions are vital in agriculture and pharmacology.

This variability is due to multiple environmental drivers - including browsing by herbivores such as deer, seed availability and physical characteristics of forest gaps and stands - many of which can be influenced by forest management. Identifying management actions that produce regeneration abundance and composition appropriate for the long-term sustainability of multiple forest values (e.g., timber, wildlife) is a difficult task. However, this task can be aided by simulation tools that improve understanding and enable evaluation of synergies and trade-offs between management actions for different resources. We present a forest tree regeneration, growth, and harvest simulation model developed with the express purpose of assisting managers to evaluate the impacts of timber and deer management on tree regeneration and forest dynamics in northern hardwood forests over long time periods under different scenarios. The model couples regeneration and deer density sub-models developed from empirical data with the Ontario variant of the US Forest Service individual-based forest growth model, Forest Vegetation Simulator. Our error analyses show that model output is robust given uncertainty in the sub-models. We investigate scenarios for timber and deer management actions in northern hardwood stands for 200 years. Results indicate that higher levels of mature ironwood (Ostrya virginiana) removal and lower deer densities significantly increase sugar maple (Acer saccharum) regeneration success rates. Furthermore, our results show that although deer densities have an immediate and consistent negative impact on forest regeneration and timber through time, the non-removal of mature ironwood trees has cumulative negative impacts due to feedbacks on competition between ironwood and sugar maple. These results demonstrate the utility of the simulation model to managers for examining long-term impacts, synergies and trade-offs of multiple forest management actions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Alternatively, environmentally induced stress can result in increased investment in DNA repair at the expense of reproduction. Here, we directly test whether sexual harassment by males, known to reduce female condition, affects female capacity to alleviate DNA damage in Drosophila melanogaster fruitflies. Female gametes can repair double-strand DNA breaks in sperm, which allows manipulating mutation rate independently from female condition. We show that male harassment strongly not only reduces female fecundity, but also reduces the yield of dominant lethal mutations, supporting the hypothesis that stressed organisms invest relatively more in repair mechanisms.

In the rangelands of semi-arid and arid Australia, the thorny acacia, Acacia farnesiana (L.)

The potential for A. farnesiana to expand rapidly in response to changes in land use was examined by quantifying the reproductive output, dispersal, seed-bank density, and germination of seeds of A. farnesiana. Even in the absence of high grazing pressure, low numbers of seeds were produced and these were mainly locally dispersed, although long-distance dispersal via floods could occur. Pre-dispersal seed predation is likely to reduce the seed output, and despite strong physical seed dormancy, soil-stored seed banks were not large. Seed dormancy is broken by scarification but not strongly synergistically with fire or by fire alone, and fire may have a small effect on recruitment. Hence, pulse recruitment seems unlikely given the match between seedling densities and seed-bank density. These patterns suggest that A. farnesiana is unlikely to encroach rapidly into grasslands unless there is widespread landscape disturbance that triggers broad-scale dispersal, such as floods, and or physical scarification of seed.",0,2013,35,4,427,433,10.1071/RJ13036"Alsterberg, C; Sundback, K",Experimental warming and toxicant exposure can result in antagonistic effects in a shallow-water sediment system,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,Article,Multiple stressors; Global warming; Toxins; Sediment; Microphytobenthos,"It has been suggested that future warming will exacerbate the effect of local stressors such as toxicants.

Functional (oxygen and inorganic nutrient fluxes in light and dark, bacterial production) and structural (biomass and composition of microphytobenthos and meiofauna) variables were measured. Warming was found to modify the toxicant response antagonistically, i.e. warming removed the negative effect of the toxicant exposure.

Canebrakes were important wildlife habitat within the bottom land hardwood forest ecosystem. They have been reduced in areal coverage by an estimated 98 % since European settlement due to land conversion and the drastic alteration of disturbance regimes in their floodplain habitat. Ongoing canebrake restoration efforts are hampered by incomplete understanding of the role of natural disturbance in cane ecology. We used a large tornado blowdown and multiple prescribed fires to quantify the response of cane to the sequential disturbances of windstorm and fire in the Tensas Watershed of northeastern Louisiana using number and condition of bamboo stems (culms) as response variables. We hypothesized that culms would be more abundant in burned than in unburned stands and that culm populations in burned stands would be younger than in unburned stands. In this study, conducted four years post fire, effects of both windstorm and burning were additive and beneficial. Results indicate that periodic aboveground disturbance has three salutary effects on cane ramet demography: 1) clonal growth following disturbances more than compensates for any culms killed; 2) the cohort of new culms is younger than the culms they replace; and 3) disturbance appears to inoculate some cane stands for several years against local die-offs. Fire is a valuable tool for canebrake management.

We used an additive diversity partitioning framework and quantified species richness patterns of grassland plant communities affected by marmot disturbance across different spatial scales: within and among on- and off-marmot-mound subsites, among sites, and among landscape units (corresponding to alpha and three levels of beta richness). Values of beta richness among subsites and beta richness among landscape units were similar to those expected by chance. This suggests that plant species are randomly distributed among subsites and among landscape units, despite the prediction based on previous studies that local-scale disturbance by Siberian marmots and its interactive effects with landscape contexts disproportionately influence spatial patterns of plant species. Of the spatial components of regional richness, only the beta richness among sites was significantly different from the expected value, probably reflecting the differential spatial pattern of disturbance by marmots at a site scale. The beta richness among landscape units contributed the most to regional richness, whereas beta richness among subsites and among sites contributed less.

Agroforestry systems are ideal for such experiments due to their increased uniformity and the relative ease with which factors can be manipulated and isolated. Manipulating the availability of food resources, we carried out an experimental test of this potential driver on bird diversity measures and the predatory services provided by birds in coffee agroforests. We constructed exclosures over coffee plants to measure arthropod removal intensity by birds comparing coffee agroforests with and without food resource (fruit) enrichment (the driver). Fruit enrichment agroforests had significantly greater bird species density (50%), overall abundance (55%), and abundance of understory insectivore specialists (89%) compared with control agroforests. Although 48 percent more arthropods were aspirated from coffee plants inside exclosures compared to coffee plants outside exclosures, fruit resource enrichment did not influence predatory activity by birds in the agroforests.

The situation is especially acute in Mediterranean ecosystems where the high human population density incurs multiple sources of disturbance and high propagule pressure. In this study, we characterize the relationship between native and exotic forest insect richness and evaluate how human-mediated disturbances can influence this relationship in the Mediterranean central Chile. Exotic and native species richness were positively correlated across the study area, suggesting similar effect of environmental variables on both assemblages over large scales. When the effect of human-mediated disturbances was evaluated using generalized linear and additive models, we found that native richness, human population density and habitat diversity were the most important variables affecting exotic richness. Moreover, we detected strong nonlinearities in the effect of some variables. For instance, the influence of human population density on the exotic richness followed a threshold function, where below 1,000 hab/km(2), the proportion of exotics in the community grew rapidly with increasing human density, but above this threshold density, human population did not produce further increases in exotic richness. Two important conclusions arise from these results: first, there is a positive effect of human-mediated disturbances on the exotic richness in central Chile, and second, the key role that human population density has on the invasibility of insect communities in rural and semi-rural Mediterranean areas.",0,2012,21,14,3699,3710,10.1007/s10531-012-0391-2"Cote, J; Roussel, JM; Cam, S; Bal, G; Evanno, G",Population differences in response to hypoxic stress in Atlantic salmon,JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,Article,adaptation; phenotypic plasticity; reaction norm; Salmo salar,"Understanding whether populations can adapt to new environmental conditions is a major issue in conservation and evolutionary biology.

Such hypoxic stress can alter the development and even be lethal for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) embryos that spend their early life into gravel beds. In this study, we used a common garden experiment to compare the responses to hypoxic stress of four genetically differentiated and environmentally contrasted populations. We used factorial crossing designs to measure additive genetic variation of early life-history traits in each population. Embryos were reared under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and we measured their survival, incubation time and length at the end of embryonic development. Under hypoxic conditions, embryos had a lower survival and hatched later than in normoxic conditions. We found different hypoxia reaction norms among populations, but almost no population effect in both treatments.

Climate change, habitat loss and nitrogen deposition have been identified as the key threats to biodiversity loss in these regions, yet their combined effects are poorly understood. We measured the interactive effects of rainfall manipulation (reduction, control, addition) and nitrogen deposition (N addition, N 1 P addition, and unfertilised) on the establishment of 19 Banksia-woodland species planted at three sites in southwestern Australia. Seedling survival and aboveground biomass was increased with water addition but was not affected by rainfall reduction. N addition alone did not impact seedling survival and growth, but interacted with rainfall manipulation and site in unpredictable ways. Treatment effects were context dependent, which we attributed to historic nutrient enrichment and competitive exotic species that prevented seedling establishment. Plant species (n 5 6) varied greatly in their water-use efficiency and nitrogen-use efficiency responses to the imposed treatments, which underscores the difficulty of generalising results to larger numbers of species. Despite our finding that rainfall manipulation and nutrient addition have complex, and in some cases antagonistic effects on seedling survival and growth in Banksia woodlands, our results suggest that local context (i.e. invasive species, land-use history) will have as much influence on seedling establishment as global changes in climate and nitrogen deposition.

Humans can simulate nonlinearities in music and soundtracks through the use of technological manipulations. Recent work found that film soundtracks from different genres differentially contain such sounds. We designed two experiments to determine specifically how simulated nonlinearities in soundtracks influence perceptions of arousal and valence. Subjects were presented with emotionally neutral musical exemplars that had neither noise nor abrupt frequency transitions, or versions of these musical exemplars that had noise or abrupt frequency upshifts or downshifts experimentally added. In a second experiment, these acoustic exemplars were paired with benign videos. Judgements of both arousal and valence were altered by the addition of these simulated nonlinearities in the first, music-only, experiment. In the second, multi-modal, experiment, valence (but not arousal) decreased with the addition of noise or frequency downshifts. Thus, the presence of a video image suppressed the ability of simulated nonlinearities to modify arousal.

Argentina's Semi-arid Chaco is an object of international conservation concern, as it is under pressure from conversion to agroindustry supplanting long-standing practices of logging and livestock grazing. We recorded from 16 (shrubby grassland following forest fire) to 27 (selectively logged forest) woody plant species per site and 37 species in total (gamma diversity). Additive partitioning showed that alpha diversity contributed 59% to gamma diversity and beta diversity only 41%. A separate additive partitioning of gamma diversity of the 13 forested sites alone showed that beta diversity attributable to logging history was considerably lower than remaining beta diversity and alpha diversity. Ordination analyses confirmed this finding: species composition of unlogged, selectively logged and intensively logged forest sites was quite similar. Results suggest that (1) woody vegetation, at least, of the Semi-arid Chaco is quite tolerant to traditional modes of land use and that (2) conservation of this vegetation as a whole must include not only ""pristine"" sites varying in edaphic conditions but also sites varying in land use and management histories.

Especially under changing environmental conditions there is an increasing need of identifying management options for preserving biodiversity. However, the design of historical data sets is often inappropriate for detecting biodiversity responses to ongoing rapid changes. Here, we present an approach to quantify plant species diversity and relate it to land use diversity. Data mining took place at the landscape scale in two mountainous regions of Central Europe, differing in natural and cultural history. Within these landscapes a representative systematic rectangular grid (7 x 7 plots of 1 ha) was sampled. At each plot polygons of uniform land use were mapped and presence-absence data of plant species were recorded. Plant species diversity differed significantly between landscapes: species richness and within landscape beta diversity in the calcareous mosaic landscape was higher than in the siliceous mosaic landscape. Land use diversity explained the significant variation in species richness. The relationship between plant species diversity and land use diversity is consistent in different cultivated landscapes and on multiple scales. The chosen sampling approach integrates the advantage of random but grid-based sampling with land use polygon specific information. This enables not only to investigate also similarity pattern (in land use and species composition) but also an integration of further information on the patch scale, if needed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we characterized gap recovery after complete removal of eelgrass (Zostera marina) in Willapa Bay, Washington, USA. In separate experiments, we imposed two disturbance types - shoot damage and shoot removal - at different magnitudes and frequencies. We examined a broad suite of morphological and life history responses relevant to the ability of Z. marina to tolerate and recolonize following disturbance. We found that at multiple sites, 4 m(2) gaps in eelgrass meadows recovered in 2 years. Experiments revealed that cut shoots had a short-term reduction in growth, decline in shoot width in relation to the number of cutting events, and a drop in clonal branching. In contrast, in thinned plots, both clonal branching and seedling size increased. Upper-elevation intertidal plants shared many traits of cut plants, particularly lower growth and size, but maintained similar clonal branching and shoot densities as at lower intertidal elevations. Sexual reproduction appeared inflexible to disturbances imposed over the summer experimental period but differed by elevation, with upper-elevation plants showing increased flowering, lower seedling densities, but higher seedling survival. Effects of multiple disturbances were generally additive even though individually their effects varied in magnitude and direction. One exception was an antagonism that appeared in sheath width: cutting had less effect at upper than lower elevation. Overall, Z. marina tolerated shoot damage through remodeling that reduced shoot size, and shoots compensated following loss of neighbors via enhanced clonal branching. Recolonization in this estuary should be further accelerated by sexual reproduction, despite weak responses to disturbance treatments, because seedling densities in late summer (4 m(-2)) contributed 20-56% of shoot births.

This study compares the effect of forest edges and anthropogenic gaps on the reproductive success of a self-incompatible epiphytic plant (Mitraria coccinea), mediated by changes in its relationship with mutualists (pollinators) and antagonists (flower larcenists). Mitraria coccinea's flowers are pollinated by hummingbirds and robbed by the bumblebee Bombus dahlbomii. Edges and gaps had comparable positive effects on flower production and fruit set; however, nectar robbing was up to sevenfold higher in patches with numerous gaps and resulted in lower reproductive success (fruit set and total fruit crop).

For millennia, much of the habitat of these regions was only lightly modified by human endeavour, yet now it is experiencing rampant deforestation, logging, biofuel cropping, invasive species expansion, and the synergies of climate change, drought, fire and sea-level rise. Although small-scale conservation management might assist some species and habitats, the broader sweep of problems requires big thinking and some radical solutions. Given the long expected lead times between progressive economic development and stabilization of human population size and consumption rates, we argue that 'technological fixes' cannot be ignored if we are to address social and fiscal drivers of environmental degradation and associated species extinctions in rapidly developing regions like southern Asia. The pursuit of cheap and abundant 'clean' energy from an economically rational mix of nuclear power, geothermal, solar, wind, and hydrogen-derivative 'synfuels', is fundamental to this goal. This will permit pathways of high-tech economic development that include intensified (high energy-input) agriculture over small land areas, full recycling of material goods, a transition from fossil-fuel use for transport and electricity generation, a rejection of tropical biofuels that require vast areas of arable land for production, and a viable alternative to the damming of major waterways like the Mekong, Murum and northern tributaries of the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers for hydroelectricity. Rational approaches that work at large scales must be used to deal with the ultimate, rather than just proximate, drivers of biodiversity loss in the rapidly developing regions of southern Asia.

Repeat surveys of Bicknell's thrush Catharus bicknelli presence/non-detection were conducted at 88 sites across Vermont, USA in 2006 and 2007.

We performed a principal component analysis on both the local and landscape features to reduce dimensionality. We estimated site occupancy, colonization, and extinction probabilities while accounting for imperfect detection. Univariate, additive, and interaction models of local habitat and landscape context were ranked using AICc scores. Both local and landscape scales were important in determining changes in occupancy patterns. An interaction between scales was detected for occupancy dynamics indicating that the relationship of the parameters to local-scale habitat conditions can change depending on the landscape context and vice versa. An increase in both landscape- and local-scale habitat quality increased occupancy and colonization probability while decreasing extinction risk. Colonization and extinction were both more strongly influenced by local habitat quality relative to landscape patterns. We also identified clear, qualitative thresholds for landscape-scale features.

Burning reduced the proportion of the dominant Avena/Hordeum complex by 43.1%, thus significantly enhancing overall species richness by 52.5% over the unburned plots. On the other hand, fertilizer application increased biomass production and species richness by 37.4% and 13.5%, respectively, over the unfertilized plots. The combined effect of burning and fertilization enhanced biomass production and species richness by 90.8% and 69.8%, respectively, and reduced the dominant A-H by 45.5%. Burning generally resulted in lowering the dominance of the A-H complex compared to the control while fertilizer application had variable effect, reducing the proportion of A-H with burning but increasing it without burning. Reduction in the A-H complex increased the presence of other species, therefore enhancing diversity.

Within this context, extensive research in rodent models and humans has shown that intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) caused by nutrient restriction during early development is often followed by post-natal catch-up growth when access to food resources improves. However, this accelerated growth rate seems to come at a cost, as metabolic and endocrine processes that are programmed during this time cause later-life onset of diseases such as obesity, insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease (reviewed in Crespi & Denver 2005). In this issue Molecular Ecology, Geiger (2012) asked what are the costs of catch-up growth in nutrient-restricted king penguin chicks (Fig.similar to 1) by measuring lengths of telomeres, the protective DNA sequences at the end of chromosomes, before and after catch-up growth, as the amount and rate of telomere sequence loss over time has been associated with reduced lifespan in both model and nonmodel organisms (see reviews of Costantini 2010; Haussmann & Marchetto 2010). Geiger (2011) found that chicks entering the post-winter growth season at a smaller size exhibited increased growth rates (i.e. catch-up growth) at the cost of increased oxidative stress and reduced telomere lengths compared with the chicks entering the growth period at a larger size. Furthermore, chicks that did not survive had drastically shorter telomere lengths and reduced antioxidant capacities at the beginning of the growth period than all other chicks, thereby directly associating telomere length to mortality. These results suggest that while catch-up growth allows smaller chicks to head off into the world on equal footing with chicks that hatched at a larger size, it likely comes at the cost of a shortened lifespan. Thus, this study provides a mechanism that supports the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of senescence (Promislow 2004).",1,2012,21,6,1307,1310,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05430.x"Lloyd, JD; Slater, GL; Snyder, JR",THE ROLE OF FIRE-RETURN INTERVAL AND SEASON OF BURN IN SNAG DYNAMICS IN A SOUTH FLORIDA SLASH PINE FOREST,FIRE ECOLOGY,Article,cavity-nesting birds; fire effects; Florida; Pinus elliottii var densa; snags; south Florida slash pine; USA,"Standing dead trees, or snags, are an important habitat element for many animal species. In many ecosystems, fire is a primary driver of snag population dynamics because it can both create and consume snags. The objective of this study was to examine how variation in two key components of the fire regime-fire-return interval and season of burn-affected population dynamics of snags. Using a factorial design, we exposed 1 ha plots, located within larger burn units in a south Florida slash pine (Pinus elliottii var. densa Little and Dorman) forest, to prescribed fire applied at two intervals (approximately 3-year intervals vs. approximately 6-year intervals) and during two seasons (wet season vs. dry season) over a 12- to 13-year period. We found no consistent effect of fire season or frequency on the density of lightly to moderately decayed or heavily decayed snags, suggesting that variation in these elements of the fire regime at the scale we considered is relatively unimportant in the dynamics of snag populations. However, our confidence in these findings is limited by small sample sizes, potentially confounding effects of unmeasured variation in fire behavior and effects (e. g., intensity, severity, synergy with drought cycles) and wide variation in responses within a treatment level. The generalizing of our findings is also limited by the narrow range of treatment levels considered. Future experiments incorporating a wider range of fire regimes and directly quantifying fire intensity would prove useful in identifying more clearly the role of fire in shaping the dynamics of snag populations.",0,2012,8,3,18,31,10.4996/fireecology.0803018"de la Torre, L; Ceron, CE; Balslev, H; Borchsenius, F",A Biodiversity Informatics Approach to Ethnobotany: Meta-analysis of Plant Use Patterns in Ecuador,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,Article,ecosystem diversity; human-plant interaction; plant species richness; socioeconomic; environmental; and geographical factors,"We explored the relative importance of ecosystem diversity, socioeconomic, environmental, and geographical factors in determining the pattern and diversity of people's plant use in Ecuador, based on existing ethnobotanic investigations and a large database of georeferenced plant collections. For each of 40 communities, we determined the number of plants used and their distribution among 12 use categories. Plant species richness of the ecosystem surrounding each village was determined using herbarium data and rarefaction. Variation in socioeconomic, environmental, and geographical indicator variables at the community level was summarized using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Data were then analyzed using multiple regression and ordination analysis. We found a significant positive relationship between the number of plant species used and ecosystem species richness, whereas socioconomic, environmental, and geographical factors had no significance. However, ordination analysis did show a clear link among these factors and plant use patterns, i.e., the relative importance of different use categories. Study communities were divided into two groups: 1) Andean and coastal communities with better access to public services and markets categorized by high scores in these use classes: medicinal, social, food additives, environmental, apicolous (of economic interest in apiculture), and toxic to nonvertebrates; and 2) Amazonian remote communities with high scores for these use classes: food, fuel, materials, vertebrate and invertebrate food, and toxic to vertebrates. Our findings suggest that economic and social development affects plant use patterns in a selective way. Some traditional uses will persist despite increased infrastructure development and habitat disturbance, whereas others that reflect subsistence strategies dependent on conserved natural habitats may soon disappear. The study incorporates more than 20 years of ethnobotanical research effort and a combined herbarium specimen database with more than 250,000 georeferenced records.

The survey showed that drift algae varied considerably between sites and sampling times, and sites experienced average loads of 0.4 to 0.8 kg fresh wt m(-2) and extreme loads up to 2.5 kg fresh wt m(-2). In contrast, invasive snails were constantly abundant at all sites at all collection times (mean abundance: 489 snails m(-2)). In the laboratory experiment, drift algae caused increased shoot mortality and leaf loss rate, and suppressed the formation of new nodes. Drift algae also decreased the depth of the sulphide horizon in the sediment and the oxygen concentration in the water column at night, suggesting increased risk of hypoxia. Invasive snails reduced the biomass of H. ovalis leaves and roots, increased leaf plastochrone interval and decreased the depth of the sulphide horizon. Finally, elevated temperature increased leaf loss and reduced leaf biomass, and, in the presence of drift algae, also reduced the length of the 2nd inter node. We found relatively few significant higher-order interactions, suggesting a dominance of additive effects of stress.

To determine whether estimates of mortality can be influenced by nonadditive multitrophic interactions, we generated both marginal (i.e., the entirety of mortality attributable to a given factor, including its obscured fraction) and nominal estimates of the trophic forces acting on an herbivore. This was accomplished by comparing mortality rates of the willow leaf beetle Phratora vulgatissima on willows affected or relatively unaffected by local growing conditions, in the presence or absence of natural enemies. Marginal estimates indicated that bottom-up and top-down mortality factors interacted in a synergistic or compensatory way, with the nature of the interaction varying in response to the time elapsed since the last harvest of willow plantations. In contrast, nominal estimates could not discriminate synergistic and compensatory interactions from top-down influence.

We have, however, poor knowledge on how ecologically similar species differ in their biomarker responsiveness and how predation risk may affect these biomarkers, potentially in an interactive way with pesticides. We evaluated this by exposing four corixid water bug species to combinations of endosulfan and predation risk and quantifying the activity of four general enzymatic biomarkers: acetylcholinesterase (AChE), phenoloxidase (PO), catalase (CAT) and superoxidedismutase (SOD). AChE activity was inhibited at an endosulfan concentration of 2 mu g l(-1) and this did not differ significantly among species. Predation risk inhibited AChE activity with the same magnitude as endosulfan in one species, S. striata. Reduction in the investment of immune function following pesticide exposure, as measured by the activity of PO, was only observed in C. coleoptrata at 8 mu g l(-1) while we observed an increase of PO levels in S. striata. Overall, PO was suppressed under predation risk at 8 mu g l(-1) endosulfan. For SOD we observed a pesticide-induced increase across all species under predation risk, while for CAT the pesticide-induced increase was only present without predation risk. These results indicate that even within this group of ecologically similar and closely related species opposing biomarker responses may exist, as observed for PO.

Considering both ecomorphs, we found significant narrow-sense heritability (h2) in a suite of measurements that define corallite architecture, and could partition additive and nonadditive variation for some traits. We found positive genetic correlations for homologous height and length measurements among different types of vertical plates (costosepta) within corallites, but negative correlations between height and length within, as well as between costosepta. Within ecomorphs, h2 estimates were generally lower, compared to the combined ecomorph analysis. Marker-based estimates of h2 were comparable to broad-sense heritability (H) obtained from parentoffspring regressions in a common garden for most traits, and similar genetic co-variance matrices for common garden and wild populations may indicate relatively small G x E interactions.

The performance (frequency, abundance, and size) of the two associate species in neighbored patches (patches formed by a dominant species which were closely adjacent to the patches formed by the other dominant species), isolated patches (patches formed by one dominant species with no neighbor), and open areas was compared to analyze the individual and combined effects of the two dominant species. A. splendens and N. tangutorum appeared to have reciprocal facilitation effects when growing adjacent to one another, as evidenced by the increased size of neighbored patches over isolated ones. The individual effects of A. splendens on the associate species should be generally neutral, since the frequency, abundance, size, and co-occurrence frequency of the two associate species in isolated A. splendens patches and open areas were the same (except for the significantly larger size of R. soongorica in isolated A. splendens patches). The individual effects of N. tangutorum were positive to the associate species R. soongorica, as evidenced by the fact that the frequency and abundance of R. soongorica was significantly higher (P < 0.05), and the size of two associate species was significantly larger (P < 0.05), in isolated N. tangutorum patches than in open areas. However, the frequency and abundance of P. australis, and the co-occurrence frequency of the two associate species in isolated N. tangutorum patches and in open areas were the same.

We evaluated the effects of a marine herbivore (i.e. the crab Neohelice granulata) on plant secondary succession in a southwestern Atlantic salt marsh. Field surveys revealed that disturbance-generated bare patches have harsh physical conditions and that their edges suffer higher herbivore pressure compared to the marsh matrix. A factorial experiment demonstrated that asexual expansion of the surrounding plants is the only possible mechanism to re-colonize disturbed patches and that crab exclusion can increase this colonization rate by more than 30 times.

The environmental assessment literature emphasizes a similar phenomenon at the population level, arguing that populations can compensate for perturbations up to a threshold, beyond which disturbance impacts may be greatly magnified-and even cause system collapse. We integrated these two approaches to examine the roles of environment, life history stage, prior disturbance experience, and their interactions on vulnerability to disturbance in a free-living species. Specifically, we examined the effects of off-highway vehicle use on the federally threatened northern spotted owl (NSO), Strix occidentalis caurina, by measuring fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCs), which reflect disturbance; fecal thyroid hormone metabolites (fT3), which reflect nutrition; and the number of offspring fledged within a season. We experimentally applied one hour of motorcycle exposure to NSOs during periods of incubation (May) and fledging (July), comparing fGC levels of treated NSO with those of non-exposed controls. Acute vehicle exposure generally increased fGCs in the short term. Males showed the highest glucocorticoid response to vehicle disturbance in May when they were typically solely responsible for feeding themselves, their mates and their nestlings. By contrast, response to motorcycle exposure among females depended on their level of fT3 and their number of young. Levels of fGCs were highest post treatment among females that lacked young and had high fT3 (good nutrition); fGC levels were lower in treated females compared to controls among females with two young and low fT3 (compromised nutrition), possibly reflecting allostatic overload. The correlational approach showed that NSO close to roads had higher levels of fT3, suggesting better nutrition. Surprisingly, fGC levels were unrelated to proximity of roads, irrespective of noise. Presumably, the tendency for traffic exposure to increase fGCs over the long-term was offset by nutritional gains (i.e., reduced fGCs and high fT3) associated with proximity to roads. Sound level meters enabled us to quantify road noise on a subset of NSO territories. NSO close to noisy roads fledged significantly fewer young than NSO near quiet roads, indicating that routine traffic exposure may decrease NSO reproductive success over time.",0,2011,2,6,,,10.1890/ES10-00199.1"Reeves, MK; Perdue, M; Blakemore, GD; Rinella, DJ; Holyoak, M",Twice as easy to catch?

We built on a prior field study in which we demonstrated that a chemical contaminant, copper (Cu) and odonate predators were correlated with more frequent observations of skeletal abnormalities in Alaskan wood frog (Rana sylvatica) tadpoles. Our prior study established a multiple stressor effect linked to an important environmental phenomenon (malformed amphibians) but did not provide clear mechanisms that might guide management. We here investigated behavioral mechanisms because of their potential to produce large changes in predation dynamics, and because in published studies low concentrations of Cu produced behavioral changes in predator-detection in fish. Surprisingly, low but environmentally relevant concentrations of Cu (5 mu g/L) combined with chemical cues from a predator (Aeshna sitchensis) to produce large changes in the behavior of larval amphibians. Experiments demonstrated that a low concentration of Cu did not inhibit the ability of wood frog tadpoles to detect chemical cues of predators by olfactory means, but produced strong behavioral effects, causing tadpoles to reduce activity and alter microhabitat use. These results occurred with Cu at an exposure level lower than any we could find reported as toxic to amphibians in the literature. When Cu and predator cues were administered together, the activity reduction was additive and stronger at earlier life stages. We suggest that Cu intoxication would be disadvantageous to larval amphibian prey with prolonged exposure to predators during development, and we present field data from 2010 that support this assertion.

The future of coral reef systems at local, regional and global scales is highly uncertain, which poses a challenge to decision makers in designing appropriate strategies for managing human activities that affect reef resilience. Scenario analysis using simulation models can inform decision making by exploring possible futures under alternative management frameworks. Here, we use a spatially explicit, regional-scale simulation model for coral reefs in the Meso-American Reef system to explore the effects of multiple stressors and disturbances on reef state. Two complementary approaches to scenario analysis help to characterize potential reef responses to the combined impacts of climate and land-use change in the Meso-American Reef region. Sedimentation and nutrification emerge as key factors in decreasing the resilience of reef systems to climate change effects. The average community composition of degraded reef systems exposed to high levels of stress and disturbance tends to be more predictable than community composition on reefs that are subject to lower levels of stress and disturbance because degraded reefs tend to a common composition. This observation applies at both subregional (10(4)-10(5) m) and regional (10(6) m) scales and reflects a finite bound to the effects of degradation on coral reef communities. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

I found that (1) AGH reduced the cover of some forbs but increased the cover of others while both AGH and BGH decreased the cover of dominant C-4 grasses, (2) no treatments significantly affected species richness but ABH reduced total cover and maximum height of the vegetation while BGH reduced species evenness and maximum height, and (3) no treatments affected soil pH or soil nitrogen but BGH reduced soil organic matter, soil phosphorus, and soil potassium. Whereas above-ground mammalian herbivory has significant effects on individual plant populations and plant community structure, it is BGH that mainly affects soil parameters. Results suggest that for prairie patches where both kinds of herbivory are present, these effects may be additive leading to cumulative effects on tallgrass prairie plants both directly, through herbivory, and indirectly, through soil changes.",1,2011,6,4,283,290,10.1080/17429145.2010.541290"Helguera, Y; Diaz-Asencio, L; Fernandez-Garces, R; Gomez-Batista, M; Guillen, A; Diaz-Asencio, M; Armenteros, M","Distribution patterns of macrofaunal polychaete assemblages in a polluted semi-enclosed bay: Cienfuegos, Caribbean Sea",MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH,Article,Community structure; macrofauna; organic enrichment; Polychaetes; tropical,"Spatial and temporal distribution patterns of polychaete assemblages were described in six subtidal sampling stations within Cienfuegos Bay, a Cuban semi-enclosed bay in the Caribbean Sea for 4 months (February and September 2006, February and May 2007). This bay is strongly polluted due to the accumulation of organic enrichment and heavy metals in sediments. Macrofaunal assemblages were impoverished and their distribution highly patchy across stations and months. Molluscs, arthropods and echinoderms were scarce, but small-size opportunistic polychaete species such as Polydora sp. and Streblospio benedicti were predominant. The synergistic effects of low hydrodynamics and hypoxia derived from organic enrichment probably explain the distribution patterns of macrofauna. Heavy metal contamination appears to have minor effects on fauna; low bioavailability of metals and tolerance of fauna can explain this hypothesis. Seasonal changes of macrofauna can be related to water stagnation in the wet (summer) period and concomitant increase of hypoxia. Clear symptoms of eutrophication related to organic enrichment and a depleted macrofauna suggest a threatened ecosystem where management actions have to be applied urgently.",1,2011,7,8,757,768,10.1080/17451000.2011.569552
