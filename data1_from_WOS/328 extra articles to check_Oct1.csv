(1) genetic variation between classes of hybrids (e.g., f(1)'s vs. backcrosses) may equal or even exceed that found between species.

"Levin, DA","environment-enhanced self-fertilization: implications for niche shifts in adjacent populations","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY","Review","1. pollen-mediated gene flow from ecological core populations may hamper the ability of populations to invade new, closely adjacent habitats. the potential for the invasion of a new habitat is enhanced when selection against immigrants is augmented by the elevation of self-fertilization. this shift imparts a measure of reproductive isolation to the invader. 2. whereas genetically mediated changes in selfing often accompany niche shifts in plants, the elevation of self-fertilization by plastic responses to novel, stressful, environments has not been explored. here i will show that invaders of novel habitats may have elevated levels of self-fertility mediated by alterations in floral form and self-compatibility. 3. heightened selfing facilitates the evolution of local adaptation by increasing the additive genetic variance for tolerance to the new habitat. heightened selfing also facilitates local adaptation by increasing reproductive assurance. 4. elevated levels of selfing based on developmental responses are immediate, as opposed to that obtained by multigenerational selection. 5. synthesis. the likelihood of a niche shift will be substantially enhanced if the invader is protected from the swamping effect of gene flow from a nearby core population. this protection may be afforded by an environment-induced elevation of self-fertility. the likelihood of a niche shift also is enhanced by an increase in reproductive assurance which may be vital to the survival of an invading population whose reproductive success is density-dependent.",27,2010,98,"6","1276","1283",0,0,1,1

"Yoshida, K; Kitano, J","the contribution of female meiotic drive to the evolution of neo-sex chromosomes","EVOLUTION","Article","sex chromosomes undergo rapid turnover in certain taxonomic groups. one of the mechanisms of sex chromosome turnover involves fusions between sex chromosomes and autosomes. sexual antagonism, heterozygote advantage, and genetic drift have been proposed as the drivers for the fixation of this evolutionary event. however, all empirical patterns of the prevalence of multiple sex chromosome systems across different taxa cannot be simply explained by these three mechanisms. in this study, we propose that female meiotic drive may contribute to the evolution of neo-sex chromosomes. the results of this study showed that in mammals, the xy1y2 sex chromosome system is more prevalent in species with karyotypes of more biarmed chromosomes, whereas the x1x2y sex chromosome system is more prevalent in species with predominantly acrocentric chromosomes. in species where biarmed chromosomes are favored by female meiotic drive, x-autosome fusions (xy1y2 sex chromosome system) will be also favored by female meiotic drive. in contrast, in species with more acrocentric chromosomes, y-autosome fusions (x1x2y sex chromosome system) will be favored just because of the biased mutation rate toward chromosomal fusions. further consideration should be given to female meiotic drive as a mechanism in the fixation of neo-sex chromosomes.",17,2012,66,"10","3198","3208",0,1,0,1
